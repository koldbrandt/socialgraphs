The dataset is from southpark.fandom.com where we download all character pages and episode scripts. A character link to another character if the other character is mentioned in its character page. This way a digraph can be created for characters that interact with each other. In the bottom of all character pages their category is displayed. This has also been scraped from the fandom wiki. All this information can be found in a csv file at our github page. Follow the link [here](https://github.com/koldbrandt/socialgraphs/blob/main/characters.csv).  

All scripts from the show has also been downloaded to be able to do sentiment analysis and a network showing which characters that has been apart of which episode. This dataset can also be found on the github.
