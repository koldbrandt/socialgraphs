### Introduction
South park is a tv show that has existed as long as we can remember, we have therefore grown up with it. South park has a tendency to make shock value humor which speaks to a lot of young people. "The fuck everything" kind of mentality is excatly what we find fun and entertaining. The show has evolved through the years, we therefore thought it would be interesting to dig into how the characters interlink with each other and how the language has changed through the seasons.


### Goal for the website
This website will give an introduction to the south park network. It will look at how characters interlink with each other and show stats from the network. It consists of commentary and explanations of the analysis. The analysis will be on basic stats, but will also dig into sentiment analysis of the main characters and how their language evolve through the seasons. The characters categories, which appear on the wiki page, will also be investigated to see if they correspond to the communities that can be found from the GCC.
