'''Darryl Nathan Weathers''' is a construction worker who made his first appearance in [[Season Eight]] episode "[[Goobacks]]", as a worker who was upset over losing his job to immigrants from the future.

==Background==
He first appears in "[[Goobacks]]", and he hosts a rally of many working-class men who are mad at losing their jobs to the [[Future Humans|Goobacks]], who volunteer to work for next to nothing. He tries to help them find a way to get rid of the Goobacks, when it eventually comes to all the men having sex with each other. He approves the idea and mandates that every man does it. Since then, he has made numerous appearances as a background character or a minor character, having but a line or two.

He plays a major role in the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]", in which he starts "Anti-[[Alexa]]" protests, believing digital assistants are taking jobs away from people in the workers' union. The protesting actually worked, and soon Alexa was replaced by Darryl, and all the other protestors. Unhappy with Alexa's job, Randy calls Darryl out for being a hypocrite. Darryl has an outburst, and expresses his racist beliefs to him, revealing that he has bitter intentions whenever he says "they took our jobs."

==Appearance==
Darryl has long red hair combed, red eyebrows and mustache, some face warts and large ears. He wears a white shirt under a green checkered jacket with pockets and sleeves up, revealing the fur on his arms, a brown belt with a gray buckle with "USA" written on it, dark blue pants and brown boots.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has gray hair. However, he still sports a red mustache, albeit faded, and significantly longer.
