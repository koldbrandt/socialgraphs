'''Lemmiwinks''' is the gerbil that belongs to the fourth grade class at [[South Park Elementary]]. He first appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]".

==Background==
In the episode, "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] inserts Lemmiwinks into [[Mr. Slave]]'s ass with the hope that he'll get fired. Lemmiwinks then travels through Mr. Slave's digestive system to reach freedom. With the help of the spirits of other animal victims, he escapes successfully, and is informed after his departure that he is actually the 'Gerbil King', and is thus destined for many more adventures. 

In the later episode "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", [[Paris Hilton]] is inserted into Mr. Slave's ass, and then asked to take the same journey as Lemmiwinks (with the same song played, except that the name Lemmiwinks is replaced with Paris Hilton). The episode "[[AWESOM-O]]" was advertised as the return of Lemmiwinks, but he was not featured.

Lemmiwinks makes his genuine re-appearance in "[[Bass to Mouth]]" as a child's pet. It is revealed that he is the younger brother of a computer hacker rat named [[Wikileaks]], who was posting humiliating and degrading stories of all the students in South Park Elementary. The ghostly animals from Mr. Slave's digestive system appear to Lemmiwinks to stop Wikileaks and needed the students to get him out. Lemmiwinks finally stops his older brother from posting a story that would destroy the reputation of South Park Elementary forever by killing him. However, when the [[Frog King]], [[Sparrow Prince]], and [[Catatafish]] asked how he feels, Lemmiwinks simply scurried away, feeling "devastated" for killing his brother, or at least according to them.

==Appearance==
Lemmiwinks is a gerbil with gray and tan fur. He has a long tail. He can sometimes be seen wearing a metal helmet with a torch on top.

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
Lemmiwinks appears in the game as a minor character. He is found in the fifth grade classroom of [[South Park Elementary]] and friends the player when he talks to it.

==Prominence==
*"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]" - Debut appearance as the class gerbil.
*"[[Bass to Mouth]]" - Most recent appearance as [[Vernon Trumski]]'s pet gerbil.
