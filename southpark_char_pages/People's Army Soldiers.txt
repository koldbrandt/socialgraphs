==Background==
In the episode, the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir gets lost in the [[Costa Rica]]n rainforest after their [[Pablo|tour guide]] is eaten by a snake. The choir runs into a People's Army soldier who brings them to their camp, making them think they are going to be rescued. There, [[Ms. Stevens]] explains to the children that the People's Army is "fighting the Fascist policies of their Fascist government". They try to ask for help from the [[People's Army Leader|rebel leader]] by giving "[[Getting Gay With Kids (Song)|a gift of song]]". He replies, "We're not getting gay with any kids", then tells them to get out before they kill them because he hates Americans. Just then, government troops arrive and start a battle, during which the choir narrowly escapes.

==Appearance==
They are of varying appearances and all have black hair. They predominantly wear green and neutral colors and carry guns. A couple of them have lighter skin than the others.
