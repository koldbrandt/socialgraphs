'''Archangel Michael''' is a powerful angelic general from [[Heaven]] who appeared in the [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Best Friends Forever]]".

==Background==
Michael recruited [[Kenny McCormick]] who had completed 60 levels of ''Heaven vs. Hell'' on [[List of Video Game References#PSP|PlayStation Portable]] to help fight off an army of 10 billion from Hell. However shortly before the battle, Kenny was revived, and Michael learned that he was being kept alive through a "feeding tube". He sends two other archangels (Gabriel and Uriel) to try to get the tube removed while keeping the Hell army at bay for as long as possible. After Kenny had returned to Heaven and took control of a golden PSP to command Heaven's army, Michael became awed by the outcome.
