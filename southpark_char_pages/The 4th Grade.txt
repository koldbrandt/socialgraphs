'''The 4th Grade''' is the class grade most characters are in since "[[Fourth Grade]]". It encompasses most child characters, although there is most likely another 4th Grade classroom, as many 4th grade characters do not appear in the main classroom.

==Teachers==
*[[Diane Choksondik]] - The 4th grade teacher from "[[Fourth Grade]]" to "[[Professor Chaos]]".
*[[Mr. Mackey]] - Covered after Ms. Choksondik's death, also teaching computer class and drug lessons.
*[[Herbert Garrison]] - 3rd grade teacher from "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" to "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]".
**He later returned to the school as a kindergarten teacher in "[[Trapper Keeper]]".
**He was rehired as a 4th grade teacher in "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]".
**He was fired from the entire school in "[[Where My Country Gone?]]" for calling his Canadian students "Canucks", and interrupting the Canadian history assembly only so he could insult the Canadians.
**He was rehired again as a 4th grade teacher in "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" after serving as the 45th US President.
*[[Margaret Nelson]] - Mr. Garrison's replacement after he was fired for interrupting the Canadian history assembly. So far, she has only appeared a few times teaching the class - about planets - briefly, during the Whole Foods Inspection. She was killed off in "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]".
*[[Mr. Slave]] - Mr. Garrison's teaching assistant From "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]" to "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", and in "[[South Park is Gay!]]".
