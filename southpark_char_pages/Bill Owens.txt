'''William Forrester Owens''' is the former Governor of Colorado who appears in [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Follow That Egg!]]".

==Background==
Furious that [[Mr. Slave]] was about to marry [[Big Gay Al]], [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] was determined to stop their marriage from being legalized. She met with Bill Owens with a signed petition to veto the marriage bill from being passed, with the latter requesting for a study proving that gay families are unstable before doing so.

The Governor then went on to make a compromise by proposing the coining of same-sex marriage terms as "butt-buddies", which was received unfavorably.

He eventually signed the bill into law, seeing that [[Stan Marsh]] managed to saved his egg despite Mrs. Garrison actually hiring an assassin to destroy the egg on the very same day.
