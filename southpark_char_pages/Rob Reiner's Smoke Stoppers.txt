'''Rob Reiner's Smoke Stoppers''' is a group of political activists lead by [[Rob Reiner]], who appear in the episode "[[Butt Out]]". The group aims to get smoking banned in bars and other public places. It was revealed that they wanted to kill [[Eric Cartman]] after making a commercial, in order for it to be more realistic. Although the group is steadfast against smoking, its leader is largely overweight and grossly out of shape.
