:''For the member in Eric Cartman's crew, see [[Beth (Dawg's Bitch)]].''
'''Beth ''' is a student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She made her first appearance in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]" where she was participating in the "Stupid Spoiled Whore" fad. She is now commonly seen as a background character.

==Appearance==
She has long black hair with parted bangs. She wears a light purple jacket (similar to [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s) and cream-orange pants. As a "Stupid Spoiled Whore", she wore a blue, pink, and white tube top, a short, hot pink skirt, and pink high heels. It is worthy to note that she looks extremely similar to [[Tammy Nelson]].

==Personality==
Because of her minor speaking role, little is known about her personality. In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", she was in the closet with Clyde for two minutes and judging from his reaction afterwards, we can assume she did something to him involving the anus and/or spanking. However, due to the fact that she was participating in the "Stupid Spoiled Whore" fad, no accurate personality traits can be assumed from this.
