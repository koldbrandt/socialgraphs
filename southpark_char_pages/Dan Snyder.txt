After a bunch of scandals and lawsuits, Snyder loses the trademark to the name "Washington Redskins". The name is then picked up by [[Eric Cartman]] as his [[Washington Redskins (Startup Company)|startup company]] name. Snyder views this as ridicule, so he tries to convince Cartman in person to stop using the name for his business. He gets turned down point-blank.

He goes to the NFL headquarters to get help from [[Roger Goodell]], who is actually a robot that malfunctions. He then calls all [[NFL Owners and Presidents]] on Skype to ask for help. They reach an agreement to put pressure on Cartman's company and force it to change its logo. However, Cartman alters the logo to be more offensive and sarcastic.

In retaliation, Snyder and his team destroy [[Kickstarter]], which he thinks is the most responsible. But contrary to his expectation, Cartman's company manages to survive and prosper.

Before their away game against Dallas Cowboys, Snyder's men finally lose their hope and bail, leaving him the only player to start for the Redskins. The match ends up being a massacre with Snyder beaten into a bloody mess by the Cowboys.
