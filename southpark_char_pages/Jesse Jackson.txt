==Personality==
Like his true counterpart, Jackson is extremely passionate about civil rights, doing whatever he can to ensure African-Americans are not discriminated against and sufficiently represented. However, he is also implied to be slightly egotistical. Randy literally kissed Jackson's backside to apologise for a racial slur he uttered on live television. [[Stan Marsh]] thought this would make everything okay, however [[Token Black]] angrily remarked that Jesse Jackson was, "not the emperor of black people!" These events were a tongue-in-cheek reference to the apology Michael Richards made to the real Jesse Jackson for a highly insensitive [[wikipedia:Michael Richards#2006 Laugh Factory incident|outburst]] at the California Laugh Factory in 2006.
