'''Dr. Alphonse Mephesto''' is an eccentric geneticist and stereotypical mad scientist, as he lives and works at [[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]]. Whenever the people of South Park need something beyond the natural, they turn to him. He is the leader of the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes, the "other" [[NAMBLA]]. He tends to put more than one ass on different animals.

==Background==
===Genetic Experiments===
[[File:4assed monkey.gif|thumb|150px|The Four-assed Monkey]] Dr. Mephesto has genetically engineered many different species, such as a four (later five) - assed monkey, a four-assed ostrich, a four-assed mongoose, a mouse/duck, a gorilla/mosquito, a rabbit/fish (this is fake because Cartman said the ears are tied on them), a four-assed frog, a seven-assed Galapagos Turtle, loads of pissed off turkeys and a mutant clone of Stan.

He genetically mutates some of the sixth graders and [[Kyle Schwartz]] in [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], with [[Mitch Conner]]'s sponsorship.

===Parodies===
The character is an extended reference to Marlon Brando's portrayal of Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film version of The Island of Dr. Moreau. He is even a member of the North American Marlon Brando Lookalike Association (the other NAMBLA). Like Dr. Moreau, Dr. Mephesto creates strange creatures with his talents; however, his creations are things like animals with multiple sets of buttocks. Mephesto believes it is for the good of the Earth, and that animals with one set of buttocks are inferior and must be destroyed. He even goes as far as presenting a "seven-assed Galapagos Turtle" in an attempt to win a Nobel Prize, but loses to Randy Marsh's "Unified Theory of Fart Thing". He also performs experiments ranging from simple DNA tests to creating a genetic clone of [[Stan Marsh]] for his son's project and later a clone of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]].

==Appearance==
[[File:52a.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Mephesto's original appearance]]He wears brown trousers and a yellow flowered Hawaiian shirt with an open collar, revealing chest hair. His face is wrinkled and he wears a brown hat over a bandana that covers his hair. He is usually seen walking with a cane, whose handle is shaped like a pair of buttocks. Mephesto's appearance was tweaked and cleaned up slightly in "[[201]]", including an updated collar, hat, and gray hair.

==Family==
Dr. Mephesto has two children, [[Terrance Mephesto|Terrance]], who is in the fourth grade class with the main characters, and Kevin. Although Mephesto is shown to be Terrance's father, they are never seen together save for one episode and he is never shown with the other parents.

===Kevin===
{{Main|Kevin Mephesto}}
[[Image:Kevin.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Kevin]]
'''Kevin''' is Dr. Mephesto's [[File:Mephesto_and_kevin.png|thumb|Kevin and Dr. Mephesto watching the bike parade]]assistant and adoptive "son". He wears similar clothing to Mephesto. He is usually described by others as "That little monkey guy". He seems on first glance to be mute, but he is rumored to have a very sweet, golden voice. He mostly follows Mephesto around. His name is revealed in "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]".

Kevin's story is told in the song "[[Mephesto and Kevin]]" by Primus from Chef Aid: The South Park Album; he was apparently a failed attempt to create a perfect pop singer, a test tube baby created from [[Michael Jackson]]'s sperm and the egg of an unspecified, musically talented female donor, brought to term inside the womb of a llama. It is also revealed Kevin is legally Dr. Mephesto's son.

He is seen in a crowd in "[[Freak Strike]]". Kevin is never heard speaking until the episode "[[201]]", in which he yelps in surprise when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]/[[Mitch Conner]] tricks their way into Mephesto's lab. He can also be heard singing at the end of "Mephesto and Kevin".

===Brother===
His brother has never been seen, but it was first said in the episode "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]" that he attempts to shoot Mephesto every month on routine. Later in "[[201]]" it is revealed the real reason that he shot Mephesto is that he was a Broncos fan, and revealing that Cartman's [[Jack Tenorman|biological father]] played for the Broncos may distract the team, which was having a good year.

==Trivia==
*Dr. Mephesto is likely a Buddhist as in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]" he says "Oh, thank Buddha I found you boys!"
*"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]" was Dr. Mephesto's last speaking role until [[Season Fourteen]], in the episode, "[[201]]".
**Trey Parker later commented that by this point he and Matt Stone simply didn't find the character funny any more, and that they should have made him a member of the real NAMBLA to write him out permanently.
**He is the first character to be taken out of the show without dying, the second being [[Officer Barbrady]], although Officer Barbrady did come back with a much more prominent role in Season 19.
*Dr. Mephesto seems to be based on Marlon Brando's character in the infamous bomb "The Island of Dr. Moreau", as he belongs to a Marlon Brando-look alike club, conducts genetic experiments, and has a small but deformed assistant.
*In "[[201]]", it is revealed that Dr. Mephesto surgically alters his test subjects rather than genetically.
*[[Comedy Central]] has consistently spelt his name as 'Mephisto' in press materials, however, [[Trey Parker]]'s scripts including those for "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]", "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", and "[[201]]" all spell the name as Mephesto, and the name is pronounced as such.
*His name is a reference to Mephistopheles.
*In [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]] Mephesto says "You ever played that video game, Half-Life?" when showing the children around the complex. This likely implies that he's a fan of the Valve Franchise. (Although this was before parodying the game). [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] also said something similar in "[[Skank Hunt]]" but about Counter-Strike instead.
