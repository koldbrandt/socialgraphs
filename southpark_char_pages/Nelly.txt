'''Nelly '''is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female 4th grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[Free Willzyx]]" and received her first speaking role in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[The List]]".

==Background==
In "[[The List]]", she was attacked by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail]] when he tried to kick her in the groin, which did nothing, due to [[Eric Cartman]]'s ignorance of the female body. Nelly beats up Butters, giving him a black eye. Another attempt was made in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time]], during which the list was successfully taken from Nelly.

==Appearance==
Nelly has brown hair and parts it into two pigtails. She wears a light green sweater with a picture of a daisy on it and wears dark green trousers.

==Personality==
Judging from Butters's injuries, Nelly is able to fight. According to [[Bebe Stevens]], Nelly would never let the boys see the list, so it can be assumed she is trustworthy. Her ability to fight and her loyalty to the List-Making Committee may be the reason she is the keeper of the lists.

==Interactions==
===List-Making Committee===
In "[[The List]]", Nelly is a member of the girls list making committee. She is in charge of holding onto and protecting lists from non-members.

===[[Butters Stotch]]===
In "[[The List]]", Butters tries to take the list from Nelly by kicking her in the crotch. This has little to no effect on her as she questions what he's doing and after the other boys abort the plan he is seen with his arm in a sling and a black eye.

In "[[Member Berries]]" when she called Cartman a "fat fuck", Butters laughed really hard.

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]" she was about to fight Butters and was waiting for him to pull his pants up, which he refused to do so. It can be assumed that she doesn't like Butters.
===Boyfriend===
In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", Nelly was seen kissing an unnamed boy in a story on [[Eavesdropper]]. The story was not expanded upon in the episode, so nothing is known about their relationship.

In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Nelly is seen breaking up with [[Francis]] towards the end of the episode.
