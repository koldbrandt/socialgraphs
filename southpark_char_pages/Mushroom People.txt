The '''Little Mushroom People of Nova Scotia''' appear in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[Royal Pudding]]". They are seen during the wedding of [[Prince and Princess of Canada]], cowering, running, and screaming when the roof of the church starts collapsing and the princess is kidnapped.

==Appearance==
The attire of Mushroom People is all similar amongst all of them for the exception of their mushroom caps. They wear black shorts, black shoes, and a black bow tie. Each of them has a different mushroom cap, usually colored red or green, with various designs in white on them, as to make them look like actual mushrooms.

==Trivia==
*Mushroom People are most likely a parody of [[w:c:mario:Toad (species)|Toads]] from the [[w:c:mario:Super Mario Bros.|''Super Mario'' series]].
