==="[[The Pandemic Special]]"===
In the episode, after Randy Marsh finds out that he is responsible for the transmission of [[COVID-19]] from animals to humans, he walks down [[Main Street]] and looks at the destruction the coronavirus has brought. The street is now deserted, businesses are closed, and people are losing their loved ones. This man sees Randy and approaches him, thanking him for his Pandemic Special. Randy feels very uncomfortable and tries to walk off, but the man explains that the marijuana has helped him cope with the death of his wife from COVID-19 and being unable to face his children. Overwhelmed with guilt, Randy yells at him to stop and runs away.
