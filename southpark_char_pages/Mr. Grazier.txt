'''Mr. Grazier''' is the scout master that took over Scout Troop 69 after [[Big Gay Al]] was removed from the scouts in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Cripple Fight]]".

==Background==
Mr. Grazier is a pedophile, which becomes apparent almost immediately after the parents leave when he demands the children that he take pictures of them naked. He is eventually caught and arrested by the FBI. A Channel 4 news report went out about Mr. Grazier, which prompted [[the boys]]' parents to change their mind about allowing homosexual people into scouts.

==Appearance==
Mr. Grazier is visibly in good shape. He has white hair and black eyebrows. He wears a khaki scout master uniform which consists of an khaki shirt and pants, red scarf, and many scout badges.

==Personality==
Mr. Grazier has a militaristic attitude, which he uses to bully the children to do anything, specifically his evil sexual intentions. 

Grazier is a pedophile, meaning he is unnaturally and immorally sexually attracted to children; a severe psychiatric/sexual disorder. He is extremely manipulative and abusive, blackmailing the children into not reporting his sexual abuse and forcing them to perform degrading behavior, showing his incredibly malignant, criminal personality.
