'''The Llama Brothers''' are a Peruvian flute band formed by [[The Boys]] that appears in the [[Season Twelve]] episodes "[[Pandemic]]" and "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]".

==Background==
In "[[Pandemic]]", when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] is watching a Peruvian flute band perform outside his house, he finds out that they make a ton of money performing and realizes that him and his friends can do the same thing. They decide to purchase some instruments and costumes, but they do not have any money to do so, so they go visit [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], whose [[Grandma Tucker|grandmother]] gave him a hundred dollars for his birthday. Craig agrees to give the boys his money and he joins their band as well. The boys are then seen at the [[South Park Mall]] performing, but they find that there is a lot of competition from other Peruvian flute bands. They are then taken away by Homeland Security, who were ordered by [[Michael Chertoff]] to round up all the Peruvian flute bands and put them in a camp. They are interrogated by Chertoff because he believes they might be hybrids of Americans and Peruvian flute bands. They are sent away to Peru as a way to get Craig away so that he cannot stop the [[Guinea Creatures]] from attacking.

In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", the Llama Brothers are seen waiting in the Andes Mountains of Peru for a refueling truck for the plane to meet them there, but it never shows up. They are forced to find their own way out of Peru and come across a location with giant fruits (called "Land of the Giants Lost World" by Craig). After the two plane pilots are killed, they find a large Incan temple with a drawing of Craig on one of its walls, which depicts him encountering the Guinea Creatures. When they discover the bigger inside of the temple, Craig decides to leave, having enough of their adventure. When the walk back to Machu Picchu, they run into Michael Chertoff, who tells his aides to shoot them. He turns himself into a Guinea Pirate, but is defeated by Craig. At the end of the episode, the boys ask Craig to join their mariachi band, but he refuses.
