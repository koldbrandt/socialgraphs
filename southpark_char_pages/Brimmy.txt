'''Brimmy''' is a [[The 4th Grade|4th grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. He has remained a background character since the first season and still appears often in the show, though he has never spoken within the series and has no known personality.

==Background==
A classmate of [[the boys]]' since the third grade, he has appeared as a background character numerous times throughout the show, especially in hallway scenes and on the playground. His invitation to [[Eric Cartman]]'s birthday party in "[[Damien]]" was one of his most visible appearances. He only appeared in the classroom in "[[Gnomes]]" briefly when the kids were separated into groups.

His most notable appearance may be "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", where he was a voiceless participant in a riot against the fake [[Mr. Hankey]] in the Nebraska mall and committed a number of serious crimes in the process. (see below)

He has never spoken unique dialogue in the series itself, however he did let out a short grunt of pain after being hit by a dodgeball in "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]" and can be seen yelling ''"Yeah!"'' in "[[Quest for Ratings]]" among a large crowd of kids.

He made his first true speaking appearance in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' as one of the various boys inside Raisins. His voice sounds somewhere between [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s voices. This was also where his name was revealed as Brimmy, which was first coined by fans in the show's early seasons.

In "[[The Pandemic Special]]", he appears in a different classroom with a number of other background fourth graders.

===Criminal Record===
*'''Assault and battery:''' He is seen beating up one of the mall employees with a [[Mr. Hankey]] toy in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"
*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' Participant in the riot of children at the Nebraska mall in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"
*'''Arson:''' Throws a lit Molotov cocktail at the Lollyland step up in the Nebraska mall in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]".
*'''Vandalism''': Spray paints the walls of the Nebraska mall in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]".
*'''Shoplifting/breaking and entering''': In "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", he, along with two other kids, throws a bench at the window of an electronics store in the mall, and steals the store's items without paying for them.
*'''Indecent exposure:''' Participant in the "Wieners Out" movement formed by [[Butters Stotch]], which involves boys walking down the hallway of [[South Park Elementary]] showing their genitalia.

==Interactions==
===[[Isla]]===
In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Isla breaks up with Brimmy due to the conflict between the boys and the girls, which confirms that they were "dating".

In "[[The Pandemic Special]]", they appear to be in the same classroom separate from the main characters.

==Appearance==
Brimmy wears a blue coat and grey trousers, and most prominently a blue cap with a bright yellow brim. Several other unnamed background characters can be seen with similar appearances to Brimmy, having different colored clothing. His coat is similar to that worn by [[Craig Tucker]] and the [[Girl with Blonde Hair]]; his hat is also similar in shape to [[Stan Marsh]].

*Brimmy is one of the characters to have their first speaking role in a video game, the other being [[Pete Melman]].
*The character received a number of conjectural names from fans over many years, sometimes being assigned the names of unseen child characters.
