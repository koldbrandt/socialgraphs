The '''Weatherhead Kids''' are a group of fostered children who appear in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[The Poor Kid]]".

==Background==
Whenever a couple is arrested, their children will be assigned by [[Mr. Adams]] to be taken under foster care by the [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead|Weatherheads]], a strict agnostic family where the children are disciplined under an "uncertainty" ideology. Whenever a question is being asked, the kids could only reply with an "I don't know."

Some of the house rules which the kids have to follow include:
*Be uncertain if God exists (per the family's agnostic code)
*Drinking "agnostic" beverages only, particularly [[Dr. Pep-er]], as no one is sure what flavor it is
*Not making furniture too clean

When one of the kids, [[David Weatherhead]] claims that he saw an [[Mysterion|angel]], he is taken to [[the Punishment Room]] where he is sprayed with Dr. Pep-er, with the other kids watching. The room was eventually discovered by Mr. Adams, who then breaks down upon seeing what had happened.

The Weatherheads are later arrested after drinking a can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] which Mysterion had left for them. The Weatherhead kids are also returned to their respective families.
