'''Jakartha''' is a feared assassin. He first appear in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[Follow That Egg!]]". He was hired by [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] to assassinate [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle's]] egg so Mrs. Garrison could prove that gay marriage would not work. Jakartha completed this task, rather reluctantly at first, by shooting the egg with a sniper rifle. This egg was later revealed to be a fake, a dud, set up by Kyle because he did not believe that Stan would be able to care for it.

He later tried to assassinate the egg again, by shooting at it quite rapidly and setting up hidden bombs. He destroyed everything and killed almost everyone, but fails to destroy the egg.
