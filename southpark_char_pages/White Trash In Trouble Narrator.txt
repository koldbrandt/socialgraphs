The '''''[[White Trash In Trouble]]'' Narrator''' appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[The Poor Kid]]".

==Background==
In the show, the narrator explains that white trash (a derogatory term for poor, white people) on [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] is a "deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home." He then presents the [[McCormick Residence]] as an innocent-looking household, but with neglected children, while pointing out a supposed meth lab as well. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who happens to be watching the program on television, notices the camera and police just outside their house, and tries to alert his parents. Both [[Carol McCormick|Carol]] and [[Stuart McCormick|Stuart]] are arrested, with Kenny, [[Karen McCormick|Karen]], and [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]] taken to foster care by the [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead|Weatherheads]].

The Weatherheads are eventually arrested in their [[Weatherhead Residence|own residence]], after drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon as well. Meanwhile, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is also arrested for making a false police report on his own [[Liane Cartman|mother]]. The narrator appears once again, concluding that "we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming white trash in trouble."

==Appearance==
The narrator has gray hair and mustache. He wears a khaki jacket over a black suit, white shirt, a slightly loosened blue tie, gray pants, and black shoes.
