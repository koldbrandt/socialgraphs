The '''Jerusalem News Correspondent''' is a news correspondent for [[CNN]]. He appears in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Ginger Cow]]".

==Background==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] decides to prank [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] by dressing up a cow to look ginger, and later shares it online. While it was initially discussed between leaders of Islam, Christianity and Judaism that the appearance of the ginger cow (referred by them as the red heifer) is a sign that Armageddon is coming, they later agree it actually means the end of violence in the Middle East. The cow was eventually brought to Jerusalem and sacrificed, bringing peace upon the people.

The religious leaders declare unity between the three religions and organize a [[Van Halen]] concert as a celebration. The correspondent reports while the concert is underway, labelling Israel as "the happiest, rockingest place to be."

In his second broadcast, the correspondent reports that the religious leaders will be honoring Cartman, along with Kyle, on stage.

==Appearance==
The news correspondent wears a green vest over a blue shirt, dark green pants, and black shoes. He also wears a green watch on his right wrist.

During his second report, he is seen shirtless, with blue face paint and a blue striped tie wrapped around his forehead.
