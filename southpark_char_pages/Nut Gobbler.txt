In "[[Erection Day]]", she is hired by [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], who thought having intercourse with her would prevent his erections long enough for him to perform in the school talent show without embarrassing himself. She has a pimp named [[Q-Money]] who, upon seeing Nut Gobbler at a fancy restaurant with Jimmy, tries to kill her under the belief that she was looking for another pimp. Jimmy ends up saving Nut Gobbler with his comedy, and he has sex with her.
