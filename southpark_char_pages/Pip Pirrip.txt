:''For the eponymous episode in [[Season Four]], see "[[Pip]]".''
'''Philip "Pip" Pirrip'''<ref name="name">Pip in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]": "Well, my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip..."</ref> was an often mistreated, awkward [[United Kingdom|English]] orphaned exchange student, who was heavily based on the protagonist with the same name from the Charles Dickens novel ''Great Expectations''. He was voiced by [[Matt Stone]]. He was a major character in the early seasons, but was written out of the show and ultimately in "[[201]]", he was crushed to death by [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]], while trying to convince her to leave South Park alone.

==Background==
[[File:Metrosexual Pip.png|thumb|left|Pip in "[[South Park is Gay!]]"]]
Pip told the others in "[[Summer Sucks]]" that his parents were dead. However, in the previous season, during the episode "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]", he was seen caroling along with an adopted British-looking family in America. It is assumed by fans that this family adopted him, or were instead some of his other close relatives. It could be possible he has parents in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" because at an adult party, he is sent down to the basement with a few other children: Stan, Butters, and Dougie, whose parents had nowhere to take their children, and it was assumed that it is the same situation for Pip. However, he may have been there with the foster family mentioned above.

Before coming to South Park, he attended Stratfordshire Primary in Stratford, England (though in the episode "[[Pip]]", it was shown that he was briefly educated in London), and excelled in archery.

===Role===
During the first three seasons, Pip was a very prominent character and usually served as the "tortured guinea pig" of the kids, being bullied mercilessly. However, his role diminished dramatically after Butters' introduction, as Butters claimed more and more of the parts for his own character. After his own episode during the fourth season, Pip was rarely seen afterward, usually in class or playing with other boys, implying that since his character-decline, he had gained more acceptance in school. He made one last speaking appearance in "[[Professor Chaos]]", being among the final six of the boys' potential friends. Ironically, the last lines they speak to him are "Pip, get the fudge out!"

In some episodes, such as "[[Follow That Egg!]]", Pip was missing entirely, and he disappeared permanently midway through "[[D-Yikes!]]", his seat being empty for the remainder of the episode. No mention or reason for his disappearance was shown, although it may have had something to do with the brief war between America and Britain in "[[The Snuke]]". He did not appear on the ranked list of boys in "[[The List]]", although nor did [[Bill Allen]], [[Terrance Mephesto]], [[Fosse McDonald]], or [[DogPoo Petuski]].

His removal from the show is likely due to Matt and Trey mentioning during the commentary for "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" that they consider Butters "a better character" and Pip's final appearances coincide with Butters' growth, and in addition, Pip's role as "tortured guinea pig" was very similar to what Butters has assumed. Although their opinions can be contradicted considering the means of "torture" of which the two were dealt with are very different. Pip received lots of physical and verbal abuse, as opposed to Butters who was not so much as abused but manipulated and cruelly taken advantage of. And on occasion, Butters is accepted into [[The Boys|the boys]]' group, whereas Pip was outcasted. However, even Butters' role has been surmised slightly, with [[Scott Malkinson]] later being considered the least popular kid in school, although Butters remains a major character while Scott has only made a few significant appearances.

===Criminal Record===
*'''Underage Drug Use''': Sniffs a bowl of marijuana that [[Mr. Mackey]] gives the children to pass around in "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]".
*'''Murder by Proxy''': In "[[Pip]]", near the end of the episode, Pip unhooks Estella from the Genesis Machine, resulting in the death of Ms. Havisham. However, this could be seen as a case of "Justifiable Homicide" as Ms. Havishan was technically murdering Estella and unhooking her from the machine was the only way to save Estella's life.

===Death===
[[File:Pip is Killed.png|thumb|Pip is crushed to death by [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]]]]
Pip finally made a brief reappearance in "[[201]]", his second speaking appearance in eight years, where he politely asked [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]] to stop destroying the town (coming back while other townspeople ran away), but she merely moved forward and stepped on him as he ran, leaving his bloodied remains behind. His death was not addressed by the other characters. When asked if he was really dead, the [[South Park Studios]] FAQ replied, "He looked pretty dead to me." However, when asked if he had died for good in another question, it was replied, "it's too early to tell now, but we'll just have to see about Pip."

==Appearance==
Pip wears an old-fashioned, brown gatsby cap (nowadays known as a 'newsboy' cap), a brown bow-tie, an old-fashioned red smoking jacket, a white shirt, and blue shorts and violet knee high socks. He has blond hair. His head is shaped subtly differently from the other children in that his jaw section is more angular than the other children's, and his body is slightly smaller. However, he is occasionally seen with a more "normal" appearance. After his titular episode, Pip was cleaned up slightly, with a fringe of hair sticking out under his cap on the top left.
{{GallerySubPage|name=Pip Pirrip}}

==Personality==
Pip was generally portrayed as a sweet, caring, kind, cheerful, laid-back character, who may be constantly knocked down, but always got right back up again. The only time he ever seemed to act against this description is in "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]", where the the boys continually called him "French", despite the fact that he hated French people. Whenever they insulted him in this way, Pip would pick up the dodge ball and throw it at whoever was saying it, at times with inhuman strength and precision, including taking out an entire steroid-juiced Chinese dodge ball team with a single throw. He would usually apologize a moment later and revert to his old self.

Pip was not generally foul-mouthed, but he had uttered a few swear words in "[[Pip]]", where he used the word "bitch", and also briefly in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" - both times saying "arse". He was also seen singing "[[Uncle Fucka]]" with his classmates. Pip was very friendly with the other students at [[South Park Elementary]], but they did not return the favor.

==Interactions==
===[[The Boys]]===
In the first three seasons, the main boys taunted him, saying nasty things about him and performing horrible activities with him - in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" Stan makes him request that they hit him, claiming he would not do so, only to do so anyway, per example. However, in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", in one scene Pip and Cartman are shown seeming to get along while a bunch of other kids are talking beside.

===[[Damien Thorn]]===
In the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Damien]]", he briefly befriended [[Damien Thorn]], though this friendship also seemed to be one-sided. This became even more apparent when, at Cartman's birthday party, Damien and Pip crashed at the party, and Damien then set Pip on fire so that he would gain popularity amongst the other kids. Pip was never seen with Damien again after that.

===[[Pocket]]===
In the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Pip]]", a spoof of the novel: ''Great Expectations'', Pip befriended a boy named "Pocket" (a character based on Herbert Pocket, from the original novel) who later died of Hepatitis B.

===[[Estella Havisham]]===
Pip also had a romance with Estella Havisham (another character reference), though this relationship was also one-sided until the end of the episode. Considering the current events of the show, it is assumed this relationship is over.

===[[Butters Stotch]] and [[Dougie]]===
Pip seemed to have been friends with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Dougie]], as they were seen playing together and getting along very well in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]". However, Butters can be seen punching Pip in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]".

===Other Children===
Pip can be seen talking to [[Timmy]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], and [[Kevin Stoley]] in "[[South Park is Gay!]]".

===[[Lizzy]]===
Pip was seen at the school dance with Lizzy in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" and they did not seem to mind each other's presence.

===[[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]]===
Despite being nice to the school children, Chef does not seem to care for Pip. In "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]", when the kids are about to play football, Pip is the only one on the team without a helmet. Chef tells him that the school cannot afford helmets for ''everybody'', so he advises him to just cope with it. Acknowledging this, Pip politely tries negotiating with him to rotate who does not get to wear a helmet each week, but Chef declines his request. Expressing no concern for his well-being, Chef advises him to bear through it and "get his ass" in the football field.

Despite his distaste for Pip, Chef showed a lot of appreciation for him after he saw how good he was at dodgeball in "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]" and encouraged him to keep up the good work in order to make the South Park Cows team world champions. This did not last long, as once Pip knocks out the final team of players, Chef realizes that his obsession with dodgeball went too far and thus feels regretful for forcing the children into it. As a result, he does not bother congratulating Pip after he cheerfully exclaims that he won the game. He instead tells him to shut up as he walks out and goes home with the children.

==Quotes==
*'''Pip''': "Oh good day Damien, my name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip because they hate me."<br />'''Damien''': "Then I will call you Pip."<br />'''Pip''': "Righto." from "[[Damien]]".
*'''Pip''': "Not so fast you ugly ancient bitch!" from "[[Pip]]".
*'''Pip:''' "Cheerio! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town into bits" "Ahhhhh!" from "[[201]]"

==Video Games==
====''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''====
[[File:Pipreturns.png|thumb|left|Pip's brief reappearance.]]
In the video game, ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' Pip reappeared for the first time since being written out of the show. When the level "South Park Docks" is complete, the Japanese Video Game Voice announces "You have unlocked... Pip", Pip greets the boys, who immediately react with groans of anger. Pip begins to explain he knows who is behind the game's events but the kids quiet him insisting they were not hanging out with him and tell him to go away, proclaiming "It'll be a cold day in hell before we need help from Europeans." According to his character biography, his special ability is "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady|French rage]]", but his secret ability involves him singing "The Merrie Tune of Stratford" and then running - anything he touches will take damage or die. Aside from his special ability, Pip plays identically to [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], dealing a lot of damage with snowballs and having great range but being extremely slow.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Pip's picture is seen on the "Hall of Honor" along with deceased faculty members (excluding [[Mr. Mackey]] and [[Ms. Claridge]] who were featured, but not deceased) and [[Gordon Stoltski]].

*According to the DVD commentary of "[[Damien]]", it was planned that Pip would die in the same episode, but because back then he was needed for crowd scenes, this does not happen, until the episode "[[201]]", by which time the character has been removed even as a background character for three seasons.
[[File:UnusedSot1.png|thumb|Pip's skull in the ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' files]]
*Although disliked in the show, Pip has been very popular with many fans since the series began.
*Outside of the show, Pip is featured in 3 South Park video games, ''[[South Park (Video Game)|South Park]]'', ''[[South Park Rally]]'', and ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', as an unlockable character in each.
*Pip is likely left-handed.
*Matt and Trey compare Pip's role in the series to [[Butters Stotch]]'s, proclaiming in the audio mini-commentary for "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" that Butters is "a better character than Pip."
*Before an episode featuring his death, Pip has had a speaking role in 15 episodes.
*His last name "Pirrip" can be spelled sometimes as "Pirrup".
*Pip's skull can be found in the gfx files of ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', it is unknown what this would be used for (or make sense since his skull was crushed by the step of Mecha-Streisand) in the game besides being a weapon.
*Pip probably went missing from the show due to the war between the Americans and the English in "[[The Snuke]]", which would logically explain his absence.
*Pip was one of many residents of South Park who attended the September 2020 Week 3 NFL Broncos vs. Buccaneers game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/1310340948799479808|title=@SouthPark on Twitter.}}</ref>
