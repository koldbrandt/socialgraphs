'''Hippies''' were the subject in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[Die Hippie, Die]]". They had a brief appearance in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", when [[the Coon]] and [[Cthulhu]] kill many hippies in [[San Francisco]] and at the Burning Man festival.

==Background==
Hippies invade [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] when [[Mayor McDaniels]] allows a Hippie Jam Festival event. They are portrayed as liberal, lazy, incompetent, and whiny. Preferring to attend jam band festivals, complain about the corporations and the degradation of the environment, but they are not motivated enough to do actually anything about it.

[[Eric Cartman]] tries to rid the town of hippies by operating a hippie extermination business and imprisons some of them in his basement.

[[Officer Barbrady]] sets them free from Cartman's house after a few missing person complaints. Cartman is then arrested for false imprisonment but is let out when his assumptions about the hippie infestation are proven correct. Cartman forms the Hippie Core Drilling Team to save [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]] from the hippies and break up the Hippie Jam Festival. They use the [[Hippie Core Drill Machine]] to break through the crowd and get to the stage. Once there, he assaults the audience with a recording of heavy metal band Slayer's "[[Raining Blood]]". This plan works and drives all the hippies away, thus saving the town.

==Appearance==
The hippies wear tye-dye and colorful clothes and long unkempt hair. There is usually a cloud of marijuana smoke around them.

These types of hippies will gather to play drums in any location. If left alone, the drum circle could grow to many miles in circumference.
