'''Yvonne Finnerty''' appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode "[[Tsst]]" as one of the nannies on the television program ''Nanny 911'' who attempt to "fix" [[Eric Cartman]]'s behavior.

==Appearance==
Yvonne has a very elongated nose, a pointy chin, and thin lips. Wrinkles around her mouth, eyes, and neck show her age. Her brunette hair has front bangs with the rest in a bun. She is seen wearing a pink button-up long-sleeved shirt as well as a black pink-striped sweater vest. She also wears a gold earring on her left ear.

==Personality==
Although she is not seen actually attempting to "fix" any child's behavior, the fact that she is a nanny, and a good enough one to be on Nanny 911, implies that she is strict but compassionate, easily "getting through" to kids and correcting their behavior.

==Trivia==
*The show she was featured on, ''Nanny 911'', is a real life television show.
*She is a parody of an actual person of the same name: [http://www.nannyyvonne.com/About_Yvonne.html Yvonne Finnerty].
