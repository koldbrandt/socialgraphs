'''DogPoo Petuski''', voiced by [[Trey Parker]], is a student at [[South Park Elementary]] that's always seen covered in dirt. He was mainly a filler in the classroom throughout the first three seasons, but since "[[Fourth Grade]]", he only appears occasionally in large groups or in the playground, gymnasium, or hallway.

==Background==
Originally in "[[The Unaired Pilot]]", he was seen rolling around in what appears to be a puddle of mud or dog feces during recess with the prototype [[Token Black|Token]] watching him. Later, in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", he, along with [[Francis]], is one of Mayor [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s Assistants.

He had his first speaking role in "[[Professor Chaos]]". He was a possible replacement for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and lamented his status as a supporting character, but didn't survive the first cut. Cartman described him as "more of a prop". He reappeared in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]" as part of Cartman's entourage against [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He is the only member besides [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to have lines, yelling ''"GET IT OFF OF ME!"'' when [[Snooki]] rapes him. He makes two appearances in [[Season Fifteen]]. First is in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]" when he stays with the boys indoors. He re-appears in "[[1%]]" and is seen behind [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] during P.E. His last name was revealed to be Petuski in "[[T.M.I.]]".

===Dirt===
One of DogPoo's main features is his dirt and mess all over him, he might do this on purpose though, as he rolls around in mud/dog poo in [[The Unaired Pilot]]. He has dirt in his hair, clothes, and on his face. He also has a scab on his cheek. His parents look normal and clean, which means DogPoo probably just likes being dirty.

==Appearance==
He has messy, faded brown hair, and wears a messy brown jacket with dark green trousers or track pants. He has a mark on the right side of his jaw that may be a large mole, scab, or dirt stain, similar to Pig-Pen from ''Peanuts'', or actual dog poo. On the left side of his jaw, he has a scratch. His relatively deep voice has a slight Canadian/English twang to it in "[[Professor Chaos]]".

==Personality==
Despite being covered in dirt and having a messy appearance, DogPoo is quite sophisticated, speaking in an accent with a slight Canadian/English twang to it. The other kids and adults treat him like everyone else, not even pointing out all his dirt. He also is a bit of a follower, blindly following [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] orders in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]". He is also self-aware of his minor appearance and little interaction with [[the boys]], saying "I've been around these guys for like, five years, and never got to say or do anything."

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
DogPoo can be seen in the Elven Kingdom, where he sends the player on a [[Restoring the Balance|quest]] to destroy some Kupa Keep banners placed in the Elven Territory.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
DogPoo can be found near the trash at the [[Basketball Court|basketball court]], and eagerly accepts [[The New Kid]] as a friend.
