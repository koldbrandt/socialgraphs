In "[[Timmy 2000]]", he was on the cover of the 'alternative ADD treatment' booklet. He was ranked #14 on the rigged list in "[[The List]]", making this his official naming.

He also plays on the school's basketball team, as shown in "[[Elementary School Musical]]".

Francis' parents were shown in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]".

===Criminal Record===
* '''Indecent exposure''': During the Weiners Out Movement of [[Season Twenty]], he joins [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' cause and frequently exposes his genitals.
* '''False police report:''' In "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure|The Wacky Molestration Adventure]]", he files a false police report that adults were 'molestering' kids.

==Appearance==

==Relationships==
===[[Nelly]]===
In "[[Skank Hunt]]", it is revealed that Francis and Nelly were in a relationship. However, it is dissolved when all of the girls end their relationships with the boys, in retaliation against [[Skankhunt42]]'s online trolling. Francis is notably shocked and can be seen weeping in the hallway following the breakup. However, in "[[Douche and a Danish]]", Francis can be seen in the crowd of boys encouraging [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to fight Nelly, indication that Francis has moved on from their break up and fully supports Butters' decision to start the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement, as do the rest of the boys.
