'''Dental Floss''' is an alter-ego of an unnamed kindergartener. He appears in [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[Royal Pudding]]".

==Background==
Dental Floss was part of a concert on tooth decay. When [[Mr. Mackey]] asked on the whereabouts of [[Ike Broflovski]], Dental Floss replied that Ike was watching the royal wedding of the [[Prince and Princess of Canada]] at [[Broflovski Residence|home]].

Ike was eventually replaced by his brother [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. However, in one rehearsal, when Dental Floss along with the rest of the crew were blaming Kyle for the alleged poor performance, Mr. Mackey vented his anger onto Dental Floss for being a star of the show instead.

==Appearance==
Dental Floss has short black hair and appears to be wearing a red shirt, small green mittens, and black shoes. As part of his costume, he wears a large green box with a headcover on his head, and a string of rope as thin filaments attached on the side of the costume, imitating a box of dental floss. The name is capitalized and printed in black Comic Sans font at the front.
