The '''Girl with Pink Flower Shirt''' is a background character in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

==Background==
===Scrapped Role===
According to a now defunct website, Girl with Pink Flower Shirt originally had a large role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050207225855/fruitbowl.spcomplete.com/Spy.html|title=Fruitbowl's Article on Flower|date=April 17, 2003}}</ref> where she was originally a [[Mothers Against Canada|M.A.C.]] spy, however, by the end of the movie, she had sided with La Resistance. She was later shot with a stray bullet, and after a tearful exchange with [[Eric Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Stan Marsh]], she hacked into the "Cosmic Control Center" in order to switch her and [[Kenny McCormick]]'s "heaven/hell passwords", resulting in her going to [[Hell]], while he went to [[Heaven]]. However, the site provided no evidence and was closely interlinked with [[fanon]], so any information beyond her status as a background character should not be treated as canon. In the final version of the film, she makes a few background appearances.

==Appearance==
She has cherry blonde hair, a pink sweater with a flower on it, and lime green pants.
