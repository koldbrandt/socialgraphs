{{Featured Winner|December 2015}}
'''Officer Barbrady''' is [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s former main police officer, with relatively poor vocabulary. He is extremely incompetent at his job, usually being incapable of solving the crimes he is legally obliged to investigate. Despite this, he does manage to maintain the balance of peace in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] as shown in "[[Chickenlover]]" when, shortly after he retired, the city fell into chaos.

In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", he was fired from his job as a police officer for shooting an unarmed 6-year-old Latino boy. Following that, he was temporarily reinstated to combat [[SoDoSoPa Ninjas|ISIS]] in "[[SoDoSoPa]]". However, he was fired yet again for shooting children playing ninjas.

He was reinstated from his police officer job in the time between "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]" and "[[Splatty Tomato]]", likely due to him tracking down [[Leslie Meyers]].

While Barbrady is, like almost all adults in South Park, extremely stupid in general and largely incompetent at his job, he is one of the few characters who is never shown as financially corrupt or sexually deviant. He maintains a monogamous relationship with a consenting adult partner throughout the series, one of the few fully developed characters to do so.

==Background==
In the episode "[[Toilet Paper]]", Barbrady talks about an abusive upbringing, saying how his uncle Charles would beat him with a belt. Furthermore, his father would dress him like a girl and make him sit on his uncles' laps, highlighting sexual abuse.

For the first six seasons, Officer Barbrady was the only Police Officer in South Park, as shown in "[[Chickenlover]]". However, during the seventh season, [[Sergeant Yates]] and several other officers were added, starting in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]" and Officer Barbrady became the Police Chief. Since then, he has appeared in the background, and as shown in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]" and "[[Erection Day]]", it has seemingly been so long his voice has actually changed. However, his voice seems to have returned to normal once again in "[[The Snuke]]".

It appears that the decline in his role made him a lot more competent, as in "[[Quest for Ratings]]", he arrests a pharmacist for selling drugs to minors, in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]", he questions the evidence for a "religious cult" in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s house party, he realizes his mistake when he gives [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] directions to a sleazy part of town, shows apparent discomfort after helping to kill Britney Spears in "[[Britney's New Look]]", and told [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] that South Park was being ravaged in "[[Pandemic]]". He also tried to stop the Obama supporters from disturbing the peace in "[[About Last Night...]]", but fails and his patrol car gets tipped over by rowdy supporters.

He appeared more often during episodes in [[Season Fourteen]] with him being relatively prominent in "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", "[[200]]", and "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]".

===Illiteracy===
Barbrady was illiterate until the episode "[[Chickenlover]]" when the [[Book Mobile Driver|Chickenlover]] enacted a plot to make him read by having sex with chickens. Barbrady was also sent to school to learn how to read by the [[Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]]. The Chickenlover made Barbrady learn where he would strike next by reading the clues left at the crime scenes. When the arrest was finally made, Barbrady acted gratefully to the Chickenlover, but had to arrest him nonetheless for being a gallophile. Chickenlover then gave him the book ''Atlas Shrugged'' which Barbrady thought was "a load of crap" and made him realize reading is "a waste of his time".

==Appearance==
He wears a traditional blue police officer's uniform, and black sunshades. He appears to be slightly overweight. Barbrady is likely near deaf; he wears a hearing aid and speaks in a loud, expressionless manner. Of note, he has not been seen without the sunglasses except during the ending of "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", but his eyes, mouth and cheeks are changed due to the alien control and so it was unknown what he looked like without his sunglasses until "[[Naughty Ninjas]]" where he was forced to give up his police belongings including his sunglasses. He now wears a brown jacket over a blue dress shirt and gray trousers.

{{GallerySubPage|name=Officer Barbrady}}

==Personality==
Officer Barbrady fits the personality of an oaf: unintelligent, willing to use unnecessary force, etc. He is illiterate and illogical, and is prone to make foolish decisions, often making the incident even worse. He regularly insists that "there's nothing to see here!" in the events of crimes or other unusual occurrences. However, in "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", he does appear to have a compassionate side. When he is fired as policeman and returns home to his dog, he promises her that he will get another job in order to pay for her medicine.

==Criminal Record==
Despite being a cop himself, Barbrady has committed a few crimes in the series.

*'''Vehicular Manslaughter: '''In "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", he accidentally runs over [[Kenny McCormick]] and keeps on driving.
*'''Manslaughter:''' In "[[Truth and Advertising]]", he accidentally shoots one of the newsmen.
*'''Violation of police rights:''' In some episodes, Officer Barbrady will take no action against serious crimes, like [[Stan Marsh]] attempting to kill his [[Marvin Marsh|grandfather]] in "[[Death]]".

==Family==
===[[Mrs. Barbrady]]===
[[File:MrsBarbrady.png|thumb|Picture of Mrs. Barbrady in "[[Naughty Ninjas]]".]]
In "[[Chickenlover]]", Barbrady is revealed to have a [[Mrs. Barbrady|wife]]. She is mentioned again in "[[Spookyfish]]". However, she has yet to appear and is seldom mentioned. In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", a picture of her is shown hanging in Barbrady's apartment; she never appeared physically in the episode which suggests that she either divorced Barbrady or died.

In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", he is shown to live alone with his very elderly sick dog who he called by an affectionate name.

==Interactions==
===[[Mayor McDaniels]] ===
Many episodes which feature both Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels, it is implied that they are in a relationship - in "[[Pinkeye]]", they are seen "not wearing any pants" (Barbrady in lingerie) and McDaniels shirt open, insisting to Chef it has "nothing to do with the Japanese mafia". In "[[Summer Sucks]]", McDaniels is at her desk when suddenly Barbrady's voices comes up asking where the "little man in the boat" is. McDaniels tells him to keep looking and at the end of the scene, swoons when he says he's found him. Despite this, in "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", McDaniels is seen reading "Jugs" and in "[[The Coon]]", Cartman questions the Mayor's sexuality, implying that their relationship is secret.

Also, despite the fact that Barbrady is generally portrayed as a bumbling oaf, the Mayor still tended to call on him up until [[Season Seven]]. This is due to the fact that until then he was the ''only'' officer in the town.

In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]" it is revealed that Barbrady takes care of an elderly female dog.

==Trivia==
*Along with [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Ned Gerblanski]], and [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], Officer Barbrady is one of the four adult characters who does not have a visible nose.
*Officer Barbrady doesn't drink coffee, as seen in the episode "[[Gnomes]]". He instead prefers to get hit in the face by a cat swung by the tail.
*At the [[South Park Studios]] FAQ, it's mentioned that Barbrady has been too busy taking reading classes to do police work.
*Officer Barbrady has a Long Island accent, particularly noticeable in "[[Erection Day]]".
*Barbrady was absent in Seasons 16 and 18. He also appeared as a cameo (not having any dialogue line) in Seasons 10 and 13.
*Ironically, Season 19 is the first time Officer Barbrady and Sergeant Yates engage in dialogue.
*It has been implied that Barbrady is the town's Elected Sheriff.
*In Season 19, he has been shown working hand-in-hand with the rest of the South Park PD.
*In a commentary on [[Season Nineteen]], [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] have confirmed Barbrady has been written out of the show for the foreseeable future, making him the second character to be taken out of the show without dying, after [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]].
**This could've been temporary as in "[[Splatty Tomato]]", ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', and ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]'', Barbrady can be seen wearing his police uniform. Which means that he was probably reinstated as a police officer after the event of "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]" This could lead to him appearing in future episodes as a supporting/background character. He would later make an appearance in "[[Band in China]]", proving this to be the case.
*In "[[Mecha-Streisand]]" there happens to be a white uniform version of Barbrady (without glasses) that appears in the acting studio where [[Sidney Poitier]] was rehearsing at. This was likely an act of model recycling since the producers probably didn't have time to create a new one.
