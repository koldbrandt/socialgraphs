'''Robert Michael Schneider''' is an American actor and comedian. He appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]". 

==Background==
He finds and eats the pot-roast which contains Kenny's soul when [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Liane Cartman|his mom]] accidentally leave it at the airport in Denver. In a spoof of the plot of many of his films, he is transformed into [[Kenny McCormick]] and eventually dies as Kenny, getting shot in the head and impaled on a flagpole, mirroring Kenny's death in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]". The resulting movie was entitled ''Kenny''.

Rob was other different things before he was Kenny, starring in such movies as ''The Animal'', ''The Hot Chick'', ''The Stapler'', ''A Carrot'' and ''Da Derp De Derp Da Teetley Derpee Derpee Dumb'' - all of which are rated PG-13.

He is later revived somehow and seen among the celebrities threatening to sue South Park in the promotional image for the episode "[[200]]". He does not actually appear in the episode but he does appear in his carrot form in "[[201]]". 

He reappears in "[[Funnybot]]" in a silent role as one of the comedians attacking [[South Park Elementary]]. Unlike other celebrity characters from the earlier half of the series, his design has not been tweaked.
