}}'''Kathie Lee Gifford''' (nėe '''Epstein''') is a singer, actress, and television hostess who visited South Park in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Weight Gain 4000]]".

==Background==
As a child, Gifford was a classmate in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] class. When they were young, they competed in a talent show, in which Mr. Garrison and [[Mr. Hat]] put on a very lame, yet critically-praised ventriloquist performance. Victory seemed to be his until Kathie Lee came forth and sang, with background dancers, animals, and an orchestra; She won the talent show by a landslide. Mr. Garrison was furious, denying she had any real talent, believing the only reason she won was that "she had choreography", and has held a grudge against her ever since.

When Kathie Lee came to South Park as a special guest, Mr. Garrison, now a schoolteacher, decided to get even with her and lay off, but Mr. Hat suggested he should just kill her altogether. Mr. Garrison tried to fight Mr. Hat's influence, but gave in and purchased a rifle and held himself up in the town's book depository. Kathie showed up on a truck encased in a bulletproof glass chamber and surrounded by agents and viewed the various performances in town. While listening to [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]] singing [[Oh Kathie Lee|about her]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] has caught on to Mr. Garrison's plot and tried to convince him not to kill Kathie Lee. Unfortunately, he went forth with his plan and fired right at Kathie Lee while she was on stage, giving away the reward. However, she survived as she was thrown off when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] weight broke the stage, and Garrison shot [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] instead. Kathie Lee was rushed out of the town, Mr. Garrison was arrested, and Mr. Hat was committed to mental therapy.

Kathie Lee later made love to [[Chef]], as he was extremely attracted to her. He is shocked to find her even more sex-crazed than himself. She later reappears in a flashback during "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]" when the kids misremember her as being an alien in disguise and Garrison a hero.

She finally reappears in reality in a cameo in "[[Wing]]" near the stage at [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvester Stallone's]] son's wedding.

She is later seen in "[[The Return of Chef]]", making a cameo at Chef's funeral, she sits next to [[Elton John]]. She makes two more appearances in "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" as part of the class-action lawsuit but has no lines.

==Appearance==
In "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", she wore a hot pink v-neck long sleeve shirt over a white blouse with purple pants. In "[[The Return of Chef]]", she wore a similar outfit, but her shirt was black instead of hot pink and her hair was redder. She also wore light pink eyeshadow instead of blue like in her previous appearances. Though, she still has red lipstick, light pink blush, and red hair, just as she had in all of her appearances.

==Personality==
In "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", she was shown to be self-centered and arrogant, as she loved the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and children. She also appeared to be whorish, sleeping with Chef despite knowing him for less than a day.

==Relationships==
===[[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]===
Garrison and Gifford are rivals, as Garrison lost a talent show to Gifford as revealed in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]" and as a result, Garrison attempted murder against Gifford.

===[[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]]===
She slept with Chef in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", it is unknown if they had an actual relationship, however, given that Chef has since changed significantly, therefore, it is assumed any possible relationship is over. Kathie attended his funeral in "[[The Return of Chef]]".
