'''Ms. Ellen''', whose real name is allegedly '''Maqesh Alaq Makaraqesh''', was a substitute teacher for the 3rd grade class at [[South Park Elementary]] in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]".

==Background==
Her beauty caught the attention of all of the males in the third-grade class. [[Stan Marsh]], who was dating [[Wendy Testaburger]] at the time, even began vomiting whenever he saw her, a trait he'd only previously displayed for Wendy. Wendy became jealous, trying to get Stan to notice her, while the boys bought her presents, and mentioned her to Chef. After failing to win her over, Chef reveals that she is a lesbian. The boys then proceed to munch boxes and lick carpets in a misguided attempt to become lesbians.

Wendy eventually breaks down in front of the class, giving up and wishing Ms. Ellen and Stan a happy life together. At this moment, Iraqi soldiers burst into the room, revealing that she's allegedly a murderous spy who has been having an affair with [[Saddam Hussein]] and make an attempt to take her into custody. Ms. Ellen takes a sword in a bid to escape, accidentally tossing it at [[Kenny McCormick]], and is ultimately taken away.

It is revealed at the episode's conclusion, that Wendy had orchestrated the events, including the Iraqis taking her away, and her being blasted into the sun, thus to her demise.

==Appearance==
Ms. Ellen has short parted black hair, red lips, and thin eyebrows. She wears a long dark-grey skirt, a gray collared shirt, and a dark blue, long-sleeved sweater. On the day that Mr. Garrison returns from surgery, she wears black leather: including tight black pants, a black top that reveals her belly, and a large cross necklace.
