'''Charles Milles Manson''' (née '''Maddox''') was an American criminal and cult leader, famous for his followers murder of actress Sharon Tate on his orders in 1969.

He appeared in the [[Season Two]] episode "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]".

==Background==
Manson breaks out of jail with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s [[Howard Cartman|Uncle Howard]], and they make their way to [[Mabel Cartman]]'s house to hide out. They arrive on Christmas Eve when Cartman and his family, as well as [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], are celebrating the holiday.

==Appearance==
Manson, as he appeared in his debut episode, can be seen wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with a white shirt underneath. He has messy brown, graying hair and an untrimmed brown beard, also graying. He has a tattoo of a swastika between his eyes and has scars on his cheeks, which at the end of "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", he changes to a happy face tattoo.

==Personality==
Initially, Manson is filled with rage and psychotic anger.

Manson soon has a change of heart and regrets his mass murders after watching [[Mr. Hankey]] in ''The Grinchy-Poo Who Stole Christmas''. Realizing what he did was wrong, he changes his tattoo from a swastika to a smiley-face and tries to protect the boys from the gun-happy police.

In the end, Manson turns himself in to the police and returns to prison with Howard. He proceeds to write a series of positive help books, but his efforts are met with mockery. However, on Christmas, [[the boys]] and their families all come to visit Manson to celebrate.

==Trivia==
*Manson's tattoo of a smiley-face momentarily turns into a [[Visitors|Visitor]].
*Manson's redemption is a parody of ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas''.
*[[The Boys]] all come to address Manson as "Uncle Charlie."
*There are several times where it looks as if Manson intends to or has killed [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], only for Kenny to be revealed alive and happy.
*Manson shows horror for Kenny's death while the boys do not show much more than their normal reactions.
*His inmate number contains the number of the beast (666).
