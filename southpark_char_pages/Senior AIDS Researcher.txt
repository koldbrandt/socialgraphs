The '''Senior AIDS Researcher '''is an [[AIDS]] researcher who first appears on "[[Tonsil Trouble]]". He is in-charge of [[Mitch]] and [[Black-Haired Scientist|his cohort]].

==Background==
In "Tonsil Trouble", he and Mitch work on the solution to the disease based upon [[Magic Johnson]]'s money hypothesis. The two realize that if a HIV-positive person is injected with cut and crushed $180,000 into his vein, his AIDS will be cured. Despite some prior disbelief voiced by his cohort, this successfully cures both [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Eric Cartman]].

He makes a cameo appearance in "[[Over Logging]]".

He appears again in "[[Pee]]" as one of the scientists trying to resolve the pee flood in [[Pi Pi's Splashtown]].

In "[[Sexual Healing]]" he can be seen helping the team of scholars find a cure to the "National Sexual Addiction problem" America is facing.

He appears in the background as a [[USDA]] worker in "[[Gluten Free Ebola]]".

==Appearance==
He has balding gray hair, a gray mustache, and wrinkles on his forehead. He wears a white lab coat over a navy blue pullover, a shirt and tie, and dark gray pants.
