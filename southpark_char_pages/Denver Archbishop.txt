==Background==
Following the development of friendship between [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Father Maxi]], the South Park residents were not able to attend service in [[South Park Church]]. The Archbishop received a call from [[Mr. Mackey]] who informed him that Maxi had disappeared. While the Archbishop assured nothing had gone wrong, he assumed that Maxi had went away with other kids, and called up the [[Catholic Cleanup Crew]] to undo the "mess".

==Appearance==
The Archbishop wears a black cassock with a white clerical collar and a red belt, along with a red zucchetto and a silver cross necklace.

==Trivia==
*The Archbishop bears resemblance to the real-life incumbent Archbishop of Denver, Samuel J. Aquila.
