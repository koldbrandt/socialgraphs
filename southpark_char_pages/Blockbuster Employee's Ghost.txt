The '''Blockbuster Employee's Ghost''' appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]".

==Background==
The ghost appears to Randy working behind the counter. Randy rents two movies from him and engages in a conversation with the ghost. Due to the stress of owning a failing business and his family's lack of interest, the apparition menacingly advises Randy to "do something extreme", in order to save the failing store. The advice leads Randy to grow more and more unhinged as the hours pass by.

==Appearance==
He wears a blue Blockbuster uniform similar to Randy Marsh. He also has wrinkles on his face and brown hair.

==Trivia==
*He is a parody of two characters from ''[[Wikipedia:The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', Delbert Grady and Lloyd the bartender.
