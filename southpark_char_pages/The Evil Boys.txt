'''The Evil Boys''' were the boys from a parallel universe seen in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Spookyfish]]".

==Background==
Due to the portal being opened at the [[Indian Burial Ground Pet Store]], the "evil" counterparts of animals and some of the boys invade [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from another universe.

==Personalities==
The boys' evil doubles have personalities that are contrary to their regular selves; [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] are mean and pick on [[Eric Cartman]], while Eric is polite and generous, which are the personalities of their counterparts reversed. [[Kenny McCormick]]'s evil double is said by evil Cartman to be wealthy and recently bought a new car.

==Appearance==
The only change to the boys' appearance is the mustaches and goatee beards. The beards match their hair, except for Kyle, implying that he has brown hair instead of red.
