'''Thompson''' is an old man and the owner of the [[Garden of Betrayal]]. He first appears throughout [[Season Seventeen]]'s Black Friday trilogy, consisting of "[[Black Friday]]", "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]", and "[[Titties and Dragons]]".

==Background==
Thompson repeatedly shouts at [[Eric Cartman|Wizard Cartman]] from his house throughout the trilogy, as Cartman plots betrayal with [[Kenny McCormick|Lady McCormick]], [[Butters Stotch|Paladin Butters]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Sir Kyle]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Stan Marsh|Sir Stan]] in his garden. He laughs at Cartman when Bill Gates manages to turn Cartman's betrayal scheme on him and succeeds in informing Stan about the betrayal before Cartman successfully manipulates him. However, Cartman gets revenge on the Garden Owner for informing Stan by defecating in his garden, which he frames Stan for, getting him grounded.

He later appears in "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]", where he cursed at [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], who has just returned to the town.

==Appearance==
The Garden Owner has gray hair and a wrinkled face. He wears a light blue collared shirt and a tan coat.
