*In show, he was mistakenly referred to as working for Denver's Channel 4, KCNC, when he only worked there from 1977 to sometime in the late 1980s, when he left for rival KUSA; he left that station in 2000 to become the lead anchor for KDVR's then-debuting news operation. He continued as an anchor there until 2013.
