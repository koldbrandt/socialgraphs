'''Gerald Broflovski''' is the husband of [[Sheila Broflovski]] and the father of [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Ike Broflovski]]. Operating under the alias of [[Skankhunt42]], he plays a key antagonistic role throughout [[Season Twenty]]. He is named after [[Matt Stone]]'s late father, Gerald W. Stone.

==Background==
===Occupations===
Gerald is a lawyer and a member of [[City Council]] as the city attorney. He has handled such legal matters as getting [[Chef]]'s name put on the album for [[Stinky Britches]] in "[[Chef Aid]]". He also helped Eric Cartman to successfully sue [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] after he called him an "ass sucker". He later abused his power as a lawyer in the same episode by persuading his clients to sue South Park Elementary. This counts as a Ponzi Scheme because Gerald scammed [[South Park Elementary]] and its students by making multiple false claims of sexual harassment, then using this as a scheme for millions of dollars. Shortly after, everyone started suing each other, causing the school to go bankrupt. In the episode "[[Major Boobage]]", he gets a law passed that cats are to be illegal in South Park, but he again abuses his power as a lawyer by breaking that law after he grounded Kyle for keeping a cat away from Kenny McCormick.

===Vehicles Owned===
Gerald was seen driving a car best resembling a purple-red 2002 [[wikipedia:Lincoln Navigator|Lincoln Navigator]] in "[[Asspen]]", and in "[[Smug Alert!]]" he drives a [[Toyonda Pious]] with a license plate reading "1TMYMPG"( 1T=Want, so together it reads: "Want my Miles Per Gallon?")

===Criminal Record===
Despite being one of the adults with the most common sense, Gerald still has a criminal record.

*'''Cheesing:''' In "[[Major Boobage]]", he cheeses even though it is outlawed.
*'''Manslaughter:''' In "[[The Damned]]", he and many other trolls drive [[Freja Ollegard]] to suicide.
*'''Cyberbullying:''' Throughout Season 20, Gerald becomes notorious with his Skankhunt42 alias as he cyberbullies numerous people online.
*'''Murder:''' In "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]", Gerald kills [[Lennart Bedrager]].
*'''Assault:''' Alongside killing Bedrager, he also assaults him by punching him in the groin.
*'''Arson:''' In "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", he burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs.
*'''Assisting a crime:''' In "[[Not Funny]]", Gerald tells his son [[Ike Broflovski]] to log onto the school message board and cyberbully people, ultimately leading to Ike being accused of being [[Skankhunt42]] by his wife [[Sheila Broflovski]].

==Appearance==
He wears a magenta yarmulke, a khaki jacket with a blue shirt underneath as well as forest green trousers. He has brown hair with sideburns and a full beard trimmed into a point at the chin and shaved alongside the lips so that his mustache does not connect. On special occasions he is seen wearing a variant of his casual clothes but they instead consist of several different tones of black.

He has never been seen without his yarmulke on, except in the episode "[[Major Boobage]]" which confirms that he is balding. The fact that he is always seen wearing it would imply that he practices [[wikipedia:Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Judaism]], yet his liberal views and the fact that no other Jewish clothes are worn by him or his family implies that he is conservative or a member of a more progressive sect who wears it by choice.

He has been shown to have abundant chest hair; however, two hairless areas can be seen on it, one on each chest, presumably being the result of his sexual encounters with [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]].

{{GallerySubPage|name=Gerald Broflovski}}

==Personality==
Gerald seems to care about the environment and current events. He is typically portrayed to be kind and friendly, though he can be stubborn, sarcastic and impolite at times. Although he is seen as a primarily moral man, he is seen to get carried away with matters of money, which shows him to be corruptible, tempting him to do things he would normally find amoral and wrong, much to his shame.

In [[Season Twenty]], his corruptible side is shown as he is revealed to be the infamous internet troll known as [[Skankhunt42]]. He gleefully posts lewd and abysmal comments to young girls, and women in general. He was visibly shocked when his trolling caused [[Freja Ollegard]] to commit suicide, showing that he had no intentions of killing people. The source of this is that he likes to harass just for the pleasure of humiliating others and to feel when he used to bully as a kid.

==Family==
Gerald seems to be the most caring and rational of all the male parents in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He is concerned with Kyle learning about moral values. He will typically take up the same issues as his wife [[Sheila Broflovski]]. 

===Similarities and Differences to Matt Stone's Family===
Gerald is named after Matt Stone's own father. In the show, Gerald is a lawyer, but in real life, Stone's father was an economics professor. 

In real life, Stone was raised as a non-practicing Jew and his father was Catholic, while in ''South Park'' the entire Broflovski family practices Judaism. Stone has advertently admitted that he knows nothing about Judaism, calling himself "the worst Jew in the world". Stone also has a sister named Rachel, but she is the family member of Stone's who is not represented on the show. While a character for Rachel was originally supposed to be intended, series creators Matt and [[Trey Parker|Trey]] deemed Stan and Kyle already too similar, so they created an adopted Canadian brother for Kyle.

===Sheila Broflovski===
Sheila tends to be overprotective of her children and goes to extremes to protect them from harm. She met Gerald in the US State of New Jersey and moved to South Park, Colorado so her children would not grow up in the dangerous big city.

===Kyle Broflovski===
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is the only biological child of Gerald and Sheila. He is intelligent and has empathy for others. During the earlier seasons, Kyle was the one who was taunted and teased the most. In later seasons he has become a stronger figure who stands up for himself and others.

===Ike Moisha Broflovski===
Ike, formerly Peter Gintz, was adopted from a family in [[Canada]]. He is very patriotic towards his home country and mature beyond his years. He enjoys watching the news on TV, went on strike for Canada, and has had an older girlfriend, [[Ms. Stevenson]]. He has also saved the Canadian Royal Wedding from [[Tooth Decay]].

===Parents===
In "[[Chickenpox]]", Stuart McCormick claims that Gerald was sent through school by "rich parents," though the fact that Gerald had to work at a pizza place with Stuart and attend community college indicates that this is probably not true and is just a reflection of Stuart's jealousy, which is a plot point in the episode. Gerald grew up in South Park, where nobody in town is ever depicted as having more than a middle-class lifestyle other than the [[Token Black|Black]] family, lending more credence to the idea that Gerald earned his own way through college.

==Trivia==
*With the exception of "[[Major Boobage]]", Gerald is always shown wearing his yarmulke hat, even when he's otherwise completely naked like in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" and "[[Not Funny]]".
*Despite being named after Matt Stone's father, Gerald is not largely based on him. While Stone's mother is Jewish, his father is a gentile of Irish descent, and Stone says they raised him in an agnostic household. Stone decided to portray the character of Gerald as recognizably Jewish, stating that doing so "creates more opportunity for comedy".<ref name="whois">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title=Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate=2009-02-04 |author=Raphael, Rebecca |publisher=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045230/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}</ref>
