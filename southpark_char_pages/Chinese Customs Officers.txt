The '''Chinese Customs Officers''' are a duo of airport customs officers who stumbled upon [[Randy Marsh]]'s baggage to find out it was marijuana inside. They appear in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, "[[Band in China]]" and reappeared as a flashback in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, "[[The Pandemic Special]]".

==Background==
When Randy arrives in [[China]], the customs officers check his baggage and found out that it contains marijuana. Thus, Randy is stopped and taken away by the police to be sentenced and charged for illegal possession of marijuana by the [[Chinese Court Judges]].

In "[[The Pandemic Special]]", they reappeared as a flashback of what Randy and [[Mickey Mouse]] did in China in "Band in China", with some previously unrevealed details on what they did there.

==Appearance==
The customs officers wear white police uniform with black epaulettes. Each uniform is marked with a nine-digit serial number just above the the left breast pocket.
