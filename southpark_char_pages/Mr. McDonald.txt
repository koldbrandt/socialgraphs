'''Mr. McDonald''' is [[Fosse McDonald]]'s unnamed father who first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]".

==Background==
He first appeared in "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]" in the background at the [[South Park Elementary]] Christmas play. He later appeared in "[[Damien]]" at the bar with [[Mr. Allen]], calling [[Jesus Christ]] "gay" in the style of their sons' catchphrase. He appears to share the exact same characteristics as his son, with the exception of the purple shirt; he wears a turquoise shirt which resembles that of [[Bill Allen]]'s.

He is shown to be friends with [[Mr. Allen]] and was confirmed to be Fosse's father in the creator commentary for "[[Damien]]".

==Appearance==
His appearance is pretty much the same as his son's, the only differences being height and the shirt; he wears a turquoise shirt rather than a purple one.

==Prominence==
*"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]" - Seen watching the [[South Park Elementary]] Christmas play.
*"[[Damien]]" - Seen at the bar with Mr. Allen, laughing whilst using their sons' "That's Gay!" catch phrase.
