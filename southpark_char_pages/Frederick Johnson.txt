'''Frederick Johnson''' appears in the [[Season Six]] episode "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]" as the "Ghost of Human Kindness". He is actually a child abductor who used that moniker in order to get children to trust him.

==Background==
Johnson poses as the "Ghost of Human Kindness" in order to abduct children. He tells [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] that people are not as scary and dangerous as his parents and the news lead him to believe. He takes him to see a woman who volunteers to talk with lonely elderly people at a retirement home, a family with adopted children, and a couple fixing a tire for an older woman. After he restores Tweek's "faith in humanity", he attempts to persuade him to get in his suspicious-looking van. Just then, the police arrive, arresting Frederick and thus saving Tweek.

==Appearance==
Frederick Johnson has long brown hair and a beard. He wears a green and yellow cloak and holds a scepter. He also seems to have some kind of lighting system built into his clothing, as he is constantly enveloped in a bright light. He resembles the Ghost of Christmas Present from ''A Christmas Carol''.

==Personality==
Frederick is a child abductor, however, it is was not revealed what he did to the children, although it was most likely with the intention of molestation. Frederick is intelligent and manipulative, tricking children into willingly coming with him by pretending to be the "Ghost of Human Kindness".

== Trivia ==
*He was destined to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as a [[Facebook]] friend, but was cut off at the end of the game. His friend icon can still be seen in the game files.
