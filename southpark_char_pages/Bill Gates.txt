'''William Henry "Bill" Gates III''' is the founder and chairman of [[wikipedia:Microsoft|Microsoft]].

==Background==
Bill Gates first appeared in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', in which he was shot by [[General Plymkin]] out of rage held towards the Windows 98 operating system, which Plykmin blames for his projector malfunctioning (when actually [[Saddam Hussein]] had hacked it). He later appears in "[[The Entity]]" as one of the select rich and famous people [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] invites to view the unveiling of "[[IT]]". He has band aids over the place where he was previously shot by Plymkin.

He appears in "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]" to kill [[Steve Ballmer|the CEO of Microsoft]] and take his position as leader of the Xbox One supporters.

In "[[Titties and Dragons]]", he kills [[Kazuo Hirai|the Sony President]], thus winning the "console war" for the Xbox One, much to the apathy of the children.

Bill Gates appears to own a rather strong private armed force, as we can see him getting off a battleship in "[[The Entity]]", and Microsoft cruisers blockading the shipment of PS4s in "[[Titties and Dragons]]".

==Appearance==
Bill Gates has short, brown hair and few facial wrinkles. In the movie, he wore a light blue, long sleeve shirt and blue pants. He is also shown to have numerous tattoos on his body. In Season 5, he wore a dark pink sweater over a lavender shirt with the same blue pants. In Season 17, He wears a light blue dress shirt, a black sweater-vest with a purple and green diamond pattern, khaki pants, and brown shoes.

==Personality==
In "[[The Entity]]", he seems to be intelligent, choosing to invest in "[[IT]]", potentially knowing it will be a big success.

In "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]", he is shown to be a ruthless businessman, willing to do anything to crush his competition.

==Prominence==
*"[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]" - Being executed by shooting due to Windows 98's inadequacy.
*"[[The Entity]]" - One of the barons to attend the release conference of [[IT]].
*"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]" - Bill returns to power in Microsoft and becomes the leader of the Xbox One group.
*"[[Titties and Dragons]]" - Bill kills the [[Sony President]].
