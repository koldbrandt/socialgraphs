'''Mr. Mackey Senior''' is [[Mr. Mackey]]'s father, who appears briefly in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]".

==Background==
In "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]", Mr. Mackey's parents are at [[South Park Elementary]] to prevent him from being abducted. Although Mr. Mackey Senior's name was not acknowledged, he refers to Mackey as "Junior", thus giving the idea that the two share a common first name.

Mr. Mackey Senior wears blue shoes, gray pants, and a red turtleneck shirt. He also wears a teal, button-up sweater and small-framed eyeglasses. Mackey is mostly bald, but has gray hair on the sides of his head. He has a large head, alike Mr. Mackey, and has large ears.

==Prominence==
*"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]" - Seen supporting Mr. Mackey during the child abduction crisis.
*"[[Royal Pudding]]" - Mentioned to have been taken and killed by Tooth Decay.
