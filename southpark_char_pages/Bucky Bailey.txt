'''Bucky Bailey''' is a counselor, and the founder of [[Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers]]. He appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Butterballs]]".

==Background==
Bucky appeared in the episode "[[Butterballs]]" to host an anti-bullying campaign to help students understand the negative impacts of bullying. Despite being avidly against bullying, he consistently bullied several people at [[South Park Elementary]], including [[Mr. Mackey]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Lorraine]], and all of the students that attended the anti-bullying assembly. He bullied Stan in the [[South Park Elementary Bathrooms|bathroom]] when he learned that Stan sold the video rights to [[Nick Jabs]]. The producer was able to keep Bailey from claiming credit for the movie by threat of a lawsuit. This caused Bailey to cry because he believed that the profits from the movie would have made Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers a national organization.

He is later seen in "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]", celebrating the end of the pandemic, along with the crowd at the end of the episode.

==Appearance==
Bailey wears a red sweater-vest with a yellow diamond pattern on it. He also wears a white shirt with a black tie, khaki pants, a black belt, and brown shoes. He is overweight, has a brown mustache, and has a Captain Kangaroo-style haircut.
