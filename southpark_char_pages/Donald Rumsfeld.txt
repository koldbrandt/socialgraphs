'''Donald Henry Rumsfeld''' was the United States Secretary Of Defense from 1975 to 1977 and again from 2001 until 2006, under Presidents [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] and [[George Bush|Bush]] respectively. He appears in "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]" and later in "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]", as a member of [[George Bush]]'s inner circle.

==Appearance==

In both of his appearances, he wears a blue suit with a white shirt and a red tie. He is animated differently in both of his appearances so consequentially the colors of his clothes are slightly lighter in "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]". In both cases, he is animated with black wavy hair with gray highlights, gray eyebrows and wrinkles on his face and neck. He also wears black glasses with round, gray frames.
