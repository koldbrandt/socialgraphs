== Appearance ==
Officer Peterson wears the standard police uniform. He has gray hair and gray eyebrows.

==Background==
Peterson debuted in "[[The China Probrem]]". He had a cameo in "[[You're Getting Old]]".
In "[[The Coon]]" Peterson is shown to be a very active supporter of [[Mysterion]], cheering and thanking him vocally next to his superior, [[Harrison Yates]], and the rest of the PD.

In "[[Pee]]", Officer Peterson is seen sometimes with brown hair and gray sideburns and sometimes like his normal appearance.

Peterson served as [[Stan Marsh]]'s body for his Monster Mash's Gangamestein costume in "[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]". He almost got killed by the fire of [[Harrison Yates]] and his 2 cohorts who mistook him for a member of [[The Redbox Killers]] who may have burglarized a home.
