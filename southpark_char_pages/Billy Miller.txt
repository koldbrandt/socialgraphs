'''Billy Miller''' appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]".

==Background==
In "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", Billy is seen as a [[KFC]] trafficking kingpin and takes his business very seriously. He hires [[Eric Cartman]] so that he can repay his debt for some popcorn chicken he ate. Soon after sending him to set up a deal with [[Colonel Sanders]], he is overthrown by Cartman. The Colonel sends his goons to kill Cartman and his group, but Cartman manages to escape just as the police arrive and engage in a shootout with the Colonel's men. While trying to escape, Billy's mother gets shot in the crossfire.

==Appearance==
Billy has short black hair, wears a red shirt with a bulldozer depicted on it, dark blue pants, and white shoes.

==Personality==
Billy has a very business-like personality and seems to understand what it means to be trafficking chicken. He seems to prefer solving problems, such as debt, in a business-like way and is shocked by Cartman's ridiculous order of 10,000 boxes of chicken. He releases that he "can't move that kind of chicken", acting like a stereotypical drug lord, even saying "I'm not making any money here, I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass and I have to hire these sorters to get the chicken ready for distribution!".
