The '''Wrestling Tryout Participants''' appear in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[W.T.F.]]".

==Background==
[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] were discussing how [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Token Black|Token]] were "bad fighters" and without talent, so they decide to hire someone better to do the toughest roles and leave Jimmy, Butters and Token with the easiest roles.

They call seven wrestlers to see which one has the most talent to get hired. Cartman calls participants 17, 24, and 37 to see how they performed in their lines. After number 37 tells his story and sings a song about how he wanted to be a wrestler, the boys are surprised by his talent and hire him to act as Irene's baby.
