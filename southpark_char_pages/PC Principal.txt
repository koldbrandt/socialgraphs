'''Peter Charles''',<ref name="realname" /> more commonly known as '''PC Principal''', is the current principal at [[South Park Elementary]], first introduced in the [[Season Nineteen]] premiere episode, "[[Stunning and Brave]]". He is highly dedicated to bringing a more politically correct agenda to [[South Park Elementary]] but often resorts to punishment and violence to achieve his ends.

He was originally going to be a one-time character in "[[Stunning and Brave]]", and was intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, but [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] liked him so much that they decided to keep him around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/24/comic-con-2016-trey-parker-and-matt-stone-talk-south-park-season-20|title=Trey Parker and Matt Stone Talk South Park Season 20|publisher=IGN|date=July 24, 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
PC Principal is the current principal at [[South Park Elementary]]. He replaced [[Principal Victoria]] after she was allegedly fired, ostensibly because she did not take action against a student referring to rape as a "Hot Cosby". He is also an Alumni member of the [[PC Delta]] fraternity and an alumnus of the Texas A&M University.

Though he is initially portrayed as an antagonist, particularly towards [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and anyone else who is not "PC", he mellows out significantly in the middle of the season. He is eventually revealed to merely be a pawn in the grand scheme of things, which causes him to become a protagonist in the season's final episode, "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]".

===Criminal Record===
PC Principal has committed several crimes already in his so far short prominence, several of them only in his debut episode.
*'''Assault and Battery:''' He viciously beats up [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in the bathroom severely to the brink of death, primarily for using the term "spokesman" (instead of "spokesperson"), resulting in Cartman's hospitalization at [[Hells Pass Hospital]] temporarily.
*'''Hazing:''' The PC Delta fraternity engages in typical fraternity hazing practices, such as branding pledges with hot metal (for example, [[Randy Marsh]]). Many states have legislation prohibiting this behavior. Since he is in charge of this fraternity branch, the responsibility lies on him to prevent this behavior, and thus, he is criminally responsible for hazing.
*'''Assault/Burglary/Indirect Hate Crime:''' Ordered fellow frats to harass [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in his sleep and leave pigs - animals which are not Kosher and thus offensive to his Jewish heritage - in his room. The fact that PC Principal used non-kosher animals to shame Kyle for insulting [[Caitlyn Jenner]] means that its possible PC Principal is anti-semitic. Kyle also wakes up with shaved hair and penises drawn on his face.
*'''Child Labor/Forced Labor:''' In "[[Safe Space]]", he forces [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to filter various people's social media accounts to get rid of negativity and shaming comments. The amount of work involved drove him to commit suicide. His suicide attempt failed but resulted in injuries that appear in every episode in Season 19. Though he regrets making Butters do this, [[Randy Marsh]] comes up with a solution that is even worse, by forcing starving African children to do the same.
*'''Abuse'''/'''Misuse of the Emergency Number (911):''' Called the police for a "Code Red", which turns out to be [[Leslie Meyers|Leslie]] merely interrupting an assembly. The Police, interpreting "Code Red" as an active shooter situation, entered the gym with their guns drawn, which ended near-tragically when he shined a laser-pointer into [[Officer Barbrady]]'s face, causing him to panic and open fire, hitting one of the students. It turns out he only called in the police to remove Leslie from the School. This counts as both misuse and abuse of the emergency number 911.
*'''Threatening to Endanger the Life of a Minor/Infirm:''' Threatens to 'break the legs" of the student who used the term "retarded" in the school newspaper. However, when the student turns out to be [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], he chose not to carry out the threat and instead spoke with him in his office over the matter.
**'''Terrorism:''' Used the threat of violence numerous times to encourage people to adhere to his PC ideology (i.e. The incident with Cartman, threatening to break legs over the use of the word "retarded" in the newspaper.)
*'''Murder''': In "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]" he murders several Russians and later kills [[Leslie Meyers]], who were depicted as robotic advertisements in human form. In these instances, however, it could be considered self-defense, as all his victims were robotic advertisements in human form or their status as non-humans could also exclude it.

==Appearance==
PC Principal has dirty blond hair and a beard, slightly resembling [[Stuart McCormick]]. He visibly had a mustache, which is now stubble. He wears a blue polo shirt, khaki pants, and dark, sporty sunglasses in which he is rarely seen without them off, only in "[[Stunning and Brave]]" and at the conclusion of "[[Sponsored Content]]". He is heavily implied to be a fitness enthusiast and looks noticeably more realistic than the other characters in terms of build.

==Personality==
PC Principal is, as the name suggests, dedicated to political correctness and social justice causes. He is a maniacal idealist who passionately supports equal rights for all, often to the point of behaving extremely rudely and violently to anyone who shows even the slightest perceived sign of intolerance of any kind. He is therefore prone to aggressive, profane outbursts over minor transgressions, such as [[Leslie Meyers|a student]] talking during an assembly. He is highly dedicated to his beliefs and will stop at nothing to enforce them upon others, although he can become very sensitive to the needs of those he feels are oppressed.

PC Principal generally believes in using punishment to achieve his ends, such as up to two weeks of detention, such as when [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] correcting him when the former was talking about [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]], or for not helping [[Eric Cartman]] feed out bad tweets. He even gives the faculty detention, giving [[Mr. Mackey]] two days of detention for using the term "Black" instead of African American. When he feels pushed further, he has behaved like a bully and resorted to violence and threats as a form of manipulation, beating up Cartman and breaking several of his bones. He also fires [[Herbert Garrison]] for a display of racism during an assembly, after previously being warned. In this situation, the firing was justifiable, as Mr. Garrison was openly insulting all Canadians.

He, and all his [[PC Delta]] bros, are loud and obnoxious, often being characterized as stereotypical "frat guys" with an uncommon awareness of social justice issues, and they describe themselves as loving "beer, working out, and.. social justice". They are perfectly prepared to stand up for equal rights by whatever means they feel are justified. PC Principal has a wide range of knowledge of equal rights and political correctness issues and initially seems willing to scare and beat anyone who does not share his views, demonstrating signs of mental instability. Unlike his bros, he does not seem interested in sexual conquests or "pussy crushing".

Despite his violence towards those who disagree with him, PC Principal appears to be relatively mellow and relaxed when he feels he has won out and can be very patient in these situations. He admits that he feels he has changed South Park successfully in "[[The City Part of Town]]" and appears proud of the town. He can also be somewhat forgiving, as he seems to hold no ill will against Cartman in later episodes in the season, and is very sympathetic towards him when he is bullied in "[[Safe Space]]", and later realizes and admits to his mistake by putting too much pressure on Butters.

In "[[Sponsored Content]]" it is shown that he is uncomfortable with handicapped people, such as [[Jimmy Valmer]]. After threatening to "break the legs" of the editor of the school newspaper because a student used the word 'retarded', he was stunned to discover a handicapped child had agreed to it, and had trouble discussing the issue with him. This is because threatening a handicapped with violence, which he does with everyone, would violate his PC ethics. Thus handicapped people disarm him of his only method of getting his way. He acknowledges the use of a "micro-aggression" to his PC frat brothers in the same episode.

After the ad conspiracy, PC Principal seems to cease and relax his prejudice against straight white men as they are now considered just as disenfranchised by ads as every other group, and is not depicted reacting violently to South Park students anymore so far.

He is also a feminist as seen when he beat up Eric for saying "Spokesman" instead of "Spokesperson", accusing him of "Abusing his male privileges."

== Trivia ==
*PC Principal was seen in the San Diego Comic-Con 2016 trailer for the video game ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', and was implied to be an antagonist. However, in the game proper, he has no place in the overarching plot, being instead of the one who introduces the player to the gameplay mechanic of getting a free attack if the opponent uses a micro-aggression.
*His initials "PC" stand for two things. One is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness politically correct], while the other is his real name "Peter Charles" which was later revealed in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode "[[Board Girls]]".
**PC Principal was one of the only main members of the [[South Park Elementary]] school staff to not be referred to by a realistic name of any kind ([[Strong Woman]] being another example). He was initially universally known as "PC Principal" to students, adults, and even Russians.
*His attire, hairstyle, and mannerisms were similar to the ''[[w:c:gta:Grand Theft Auto V|Grand Theft Auto V]]'' antagonist [[w:c:gta:Steve Haines|Steve Haines]]. He also somewhat resembles [[Metallica]] lead singer James Hetfield who has also appeared in the show.
