{{LinkDisambig|Ryan (Disambiguation)}}
'''Ryan''' made his first and only appearance in "[[Cartman Sucks]]", where he was briefly seen at [[Camp New Grace]]. He was supposed to be [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] "accountabilibuddy", but it was found that he hung himself in his room.

==Appearance==
He had shiny, short, brown hair. He wore the standard Camp New Grace uniform.

==Personality==
He was presumably gay or bisexual. After Camp New Grace failed to rid him of his attraction to other boys, he was driven to suicide, in a manner similar to how [[Bradley ("Cartman Sucks")|Bradley]] almost was.
