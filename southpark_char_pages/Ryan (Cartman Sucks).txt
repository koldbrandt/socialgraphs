'''Ryan''' made his first and only appearance in "[[Cartman Sucks]]", where he was briefly seen at [[Camp New Grace]]. He was supposed to be [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] "Accountabilibuddy", but it was found that he hung himself in his room.

==Appearance==
He had short, shiny, brown hair and thick brown eyebrows. He wore the standard Camp New Grace uniform: A blue short-sleeved shirt with a logo of the camp, coffee-brown shorts, white socks, and black shoes.

==Personality==
He was presumably gay or bisexual. After Camp New Grace failed to rid him of his attraction to other boys, he was driven to suicide, like how [[Bradley ("Cartman Sucks")|Bradley]] almost was.
