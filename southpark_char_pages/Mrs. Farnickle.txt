'''Mrs. Farnickle''' is a character that first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[It Hits the Fan]]".

==Background==
In "[[It Hits the Fan]]", she is seen using the word "shit" nonchalantly with [[Mr. Farnickle|her husband]]. She later appears in the episode "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]". She asks [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] to help her cross the street, but Tweek is afraid to do it because he does not know her.

She is seen a few times at [[Farnickle Residence|her home]]. In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", she is seen again with her husband at home. She asks the boys to investigate what happened to her missing pie. In "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] comes to her house to check for and exterminate [[hippies]].

In" [[Margaritaville]]", her name is revealed when the [[Benny|bank teller]] calls her Mrs. Farnickle. 

In "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", an elderly woman who looks rather similar to her, [[Dotty Applegate]], buys a pistol from [[Jimbo's Guns]]. [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] wrongly addresses her as "Mrs. Farnickle". It is likely that the animators accidentally mistook Ms. Applegate's character model for Mrs. Farnickle.

==Appearance==
Her clothing differs in different episodes. In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", she wears teal pants, a purple shirt with red trimming, and black shoes. In "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", she has green pants on and her shirt is pink with red trimming. In "[[Margaritaville]]", she wears a teal skirt, pink slip-on shoes, and a pink shirt. She also holds a black handbag. In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', she wears a purple shirt and teal pants.

In all of her appearances, she has white hair, has a light gray shirt under a long-sleeved one, and wears gold earrings. Her hairstyle is consistent with the exception of "[[Margaritaville]]" in which her hair is curled.
