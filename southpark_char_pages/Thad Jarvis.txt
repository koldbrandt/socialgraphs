'''Thad Jarvis''' is an expert ''[[List of Video Game References#Guitar Hero|Guitar Hero]]'' player. In the episode "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", he is selected by a talent agency to score one million points in the ''Guitar Hero'' game with [[Stan Marsh]]. However, he quits when Stan gets addicted to ''[[Heroin Hero]]'' and becomes a crabby jerk and when Stan wanted to play "Cheap Trick", Thad calls it 'bubblegum crap'.

One of his notable feats is playing two songs ("[[John the Fisherman]]" and "[[Jordan]]") on the controller without the game so well that other people can hear him and compliment him on his skills.

He had a cameo appearance in "[[Butterballs]]", where he was seen in [[Make Bullying Kill Itself|Stan's anti-bullying video]]. This appearance suggests that Thad is a student in South Park Elementary.
