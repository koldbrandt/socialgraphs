'''Millie Larsen''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]]. She speaks with a strong Southern accent in some episodes, mainly in the newer ones. In "[[Erection Day]]", [[Red McArthur]] briefly referred to her as "Jessie", this was likely a simple continuity error. Millie is displayed as one of "the popular girls" in [[The 4th Grade|the fourth grade]] along with [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Bebe Stevens]], Red, [[Lola]], [[Esther]], [[Heidi Turner]], [[Annie Knitts]], and [[Sally Turner]].

==Background==
Millie likes to sing and dance, as shown in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]". She also likes to bake, as shown in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]". Her first speaking role was in "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", where she told her mom to ''"look at the little black lion."''

In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", she, along with Bebe, Annie, and Red, act as groupies for [[Fingerbang]]'s makeshift music video. In "[[Marjorine]]", she was invited to Heidi's slumber party with Marjorine and the others. She was cruel to Marjorine, as were the other girls. 
In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", she was dressed as a whore, along with all of the [[List of Female 4th Graders|fourth-grade girls]] (excluding [[Wendy Testaburger]]).

In "[[Elementary School Musical]]", she had a crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]], stating that he was ''"a dream"''. In her speaking roles in later seasons, Millie has a southern accent, although in earlier seasons, it is less noticeable. She usually hangs out with Wendy, Bebe, Red, Knitts, Esther, Lola, and Sally. During lunch, she can usually be seen sitting at the "popular girls" table.

In "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", she, Esther, Wendy, and Red were shown gossiping about Bebe, due to her newfound popularity among the [[List of Male 4th Graders|male fourth-grade]] populace. In "[[The List]]", she was shown to be a member of the list making a committee.

==Appearance==
She wears a sea-green jacket with lime trim and black trousers. Under her jacket, she is shown to wear a pink tee-shirt. She also wears pigtails, tied by lime scrunchies, in her orange hair. As a "Stupid Spoiled Whore", she wore a green jupatterned mpsuit with cutouts on the sides of the waist, salmon eye shadow and black mascara. In "[[Marjorine]]", at [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s sleepover party, she wore a pair of light green and lime plaid pajamas.

{{GallerySubPage|name=Millie Larsen}}

==Personality==
Millie is a "popular girl", therefore it is likely she has no problem conforming to the popular fad. An example of this would be her appearance in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", where she was shown as a "Stupid Spoiled Whore", along with all the other girls. Another example of her conformity would be in "[[Elementary School Musical]]", where she was shown singing and dancing along with the rest of [[The 4th Grade|the fourth-grade]] populace. Although, as evidenced by the end of the episode, her conformity in "[[Elementary School Musical]]" was most likely due to her crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]]. Due to her relatively minor speaking roles, the only other thing that can be accurately assumed is her love of Matt Lauer, as shown in "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]".

==Family==
Millie seems to have a family, however, they were only shown once together in one of the earlier seasons.

===[[Mrs. Larsen]]===

===Pet===
[[File:Millie larsen 2.png|thumb|Millie being given her cat in "[[201]]"]]
Millie is seen being given a cat by a fireman at the end of the episode "[[201]]". It is most likely that it is her cat.

{{clear}}

===[[Flora Larsen]]===
[[Flora]] was seen with Millie and her mother her in "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]". However, in "[[Trapper Keeper]]", Flora's last name was revealed to be "Neal", however, Flora's last name was given as Larsen in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', so Flora's last name is now Larsen, thus, making Millie as Flora's sister.
