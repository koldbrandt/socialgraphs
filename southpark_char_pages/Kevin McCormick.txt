{{LinkDisambig|Kevin (Disambiguation)}}
'''Kevin McCormick''' is [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s older brother. He never appears without the rest of his family or Kenny, and very little is known about him. He only has a speaking role in three episodes: "[[Chickenlover]]", "[[Chickenpox]]", and "[[The Poor Kid]]". He is often seen in the background with his brother or his family, usually at church or at Kenny's numerous funerals.

==Appearance==
Kevin has wild, messy light brown hair, with a bandage, scratch, dirt, and leaves on his face. He wears gray pants and a red button-up shirt and has a set of braces. In "[[Quintuplets 2000]]" he wears a light blue suit with a green tie, however, in "[[Sexual Healing]]" he wears a black suit with dark blue tie for Kenny's funeral.

==Personality==
Kevin appears to be slow or a heavy drinker, he speaks in a slow, repetitive slur when talking normally. However, he talks much more quickly and clearly when yelling, and has a different voice in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''. Evidence of the latter is seen in "[[The Poor Kid]]", where his [[Carol McCormick|mother]] calls him and his [[Stuart McCormick|father]] "drunk pieces of shit". Kevin seems to have violent tendencies - he tells his mother to shoot his father and later attempts to strangle his father, initiating a fight. Kevin doesn't talk much. Throughout the series, we have only heard his voice three times and he is usually quiet.

==Family==
===[[Carol McCormick]]===
Kevin is Carol McCormick's oldest son. They are never seen interacting one-on-one, although, judging from the pseudo-conversation they had in "[[The Poor Kid]]", their relationship seems to be a weak one, filled with fighting. His relationship with his mother is likely stronger than with his father.

His mother does seem to care about him, because in "[[Spookyfish]]", she tells Kenny off for not sharing the blanket with Kevin. She also expects Kevin to share with Kenny, as shown in "[[Chickenpox]]" when she tells Kevin to split his waffle with Kenny.

===[[Stuart McCormick]]===
Kevin is Stuart McCormick's oldest son. Judging from the events of "[[The Poor Kid]]", they do not have a good relationship. Their relationship also seems to be violent, likely when they are drunk, with Mrs. McCormick having to step in to prevent them from physically fighting each other. They seem to ignore each other, except when Stuart is drunk.

===[[Kenny McCormick]]===
Kevin is Kenny's older brother. The two were never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. They seem indifferent to each other's presence, completely ignoring each other. When seen together, it is usually with the rest of their family. Neither Kenny nor Kevin don't like sharing with one another, because in "[[Spookyfish]]", Kenny tugs the blanket from him, and in "[[Chickenpox]]", Kevin has to share frozen waffles with Kenny, because of the lack of food. Kevin seems to tolerate Kenny a bit; in "[[Chickenlover]]", both were standing next to each other, giggling when their mom beat up their dad.

In "[[Best Friends Forever]]", Kevin was at the hospital with his family, looking at Kenny in his 'tomato' state. The two can also be seen playing together in "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]".

===[[Karen McCormick]]===
Kevin is Karen's older brother. The two were never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. Kevin seems to ignore her, however, she seems to look for him for protection, hiding behind him in various instances. When Kevin is fighting with Stuart, the argument does scare Karen, causing her to break down and start crying. Kevin shares a room with Karen because Karen is lonely most of the time. Unlike Kenny, Kevin doesn't show much care towards her. In "[[The City Part of Town]]", when Stuart starts yelling at Karen, Kevin merely responds with slight concern, although Kenny scowls and runs after her.

==Trivia==
*In the early years of the show, he was sometimes referred to by fans as "Brooky", as the name Kevin was used by several characters.

*Kevin shares a room with Karen in "[[The City Part of Town]]".
*Kevin seems to have a better relationship with Kenny rather than the rest of his family since they are sometimes playing and having fun together.
*In "[[The List]]", Kevin is shown to be left-handed, as he is seen eating with his left hand.
*Kevin is the only McCormick family member who doesn't appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.
