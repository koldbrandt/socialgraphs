'''Great-Great-Grandpa Marsh''' was the grandfather of [[Marvin Marsh]] and the great-great-grandfather of [[Stan Marsh]]. He appeared in [[Season One]] episode "[[Death]]".

==Background==
His soul was summoned by [[Death (Character)|The Grim Reaper]] to prove Marvin Marsh his suicide wish was not the right thing to do. According to his soul, he was stuck "in limbo" for all these decades ever since his grandson, Marvin (who just turned 102), killed him when he was a child, never making it to heaven nor hell because he skipped the natural passing away.

The name confusion Marvin has appeared to be genetic, as the ghost of Stan's great-great-grandfather called his grandson "Billy" instead of "Marvin". His soul was taken back by Death alongside [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s soul who was just killed by Death's touch.

A person similar in design to Great-Great-Grandpa Marsh can be seen among [[Satan]]'s party at the beginning of "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" - may be an indication he was sent to [[Hell]].

==Appearance==

He is an elderly Caucasian male who appears somewhat thinner and taller than his other descendants.

==Prominence==
*"[[Death]]" - Seen as a naked ghost stuck "in limbo".
*"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" - A similar human soul is seen among Satan's party guests.
*"[[Hummels & Heroin]]" - Seen dressed in a picture inside Marvin's room in [[Shady Acres]].
