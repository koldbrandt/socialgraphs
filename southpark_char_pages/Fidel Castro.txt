==Background==
When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] asks his parents for permission to go to a Raging Pussies concert, they reply he may go if he can manage to complete three tasks, one of which includes bringing democracy to Cuba. Kyle sends Fidel a drawing of him crying and holding a flower and asks if Cuba could change. The letter was appealing to Castro so he decides to accept Kyle's request and ends communism in Cuba. This became very shocking for Kyle's parents since they thought the task they gave him was impossible enough to disallow Kyle from attending the concert. 

==Appearance==
Castro has gray hair, dark gray eyebrows, and a long gray beard. He wears a navy green hat with a brown and black edge and a yellow five-pointed star on it. He also wears a navy green shirt with several pockets on it on top of a white undershirt and black tie, navy green pants, and black boots. He is also seen with a cigar in his mouth.
