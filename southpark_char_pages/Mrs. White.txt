'''Mrs. White''' is the wife of [[Bob White]] and the mother of [[Jason White|Jason]] and [[Crystal White]]. She and her husband are earnest supporters of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]], meriting the White family a bad reputation in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She first appears in the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, "[[Splatty Tomato]]".

==Appearance==
Mrs. White has long, light brown shoulder-length hair and arched lips. She wears a cherry red buttoned-up blouse and blue ankle high jeans. Around her neck, she dons a golden necklace.

==Personality==
Typically mute and devoid of much meaningful expression, it is clear her son [[Jason White|Jason]] takes after her. Like her husband, Mrs. White is a parody of supporters of the 45th president, [[Donald Trump]]. At the end of "[[Season Finale]]", she and her husband betray the other citizens of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], even after seemingly being convinced to do otherwise, proving themselves to be double-dealing and deceitful.

==Prominence==
*"[[Splatty Tomato]]" - Confronts the school about their qualms with the staff voicing their liberal opinions to their children.
*"[[Season Finale]]" - Her son Jason gets killed by police, and the family adopts a new child, [[Alejandro]], from the ICE. She is later seen fighting for [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s freedom.
*"[[Basic Cable]]"
*"[[Christmas Snow]]" - Loses her "Christmas Spirit" after liquor is prohibited during the holidays, but cheers up after Randy comes up with his Christmas special.
*"[[The Pandemic Special]]" - Appeared in a Zoom conference with [[Mr. Mackey]] and other parents.
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"
