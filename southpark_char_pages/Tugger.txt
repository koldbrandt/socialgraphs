'''Tugger''' is the nickname of [[Russell Crowe]]'s tugboat. He appears in [[Season Six]] episode "[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]".

== Background ==
Tugger is [[Russell Crowe]]'s only companion in the TV show ''[[Russell Crowe Fightin' Around The World]]'', who brings him to around the world to engage in fights. After having a row with his girlfriend the night before, Russell Crowe tries to cheer Tugger up singing [[Gotta Get There Somehow|a song]] off his new album. Russell Crowe gets carried away and is oblivious to the fact that Tugger cannot stand the song. He first tries to escape on his own but fails since he is moored to the dock. Then he puts on earmuffs which prove to be ineffective. Finally Tugger cannot take it anymore and shoots himself with a revolver.
