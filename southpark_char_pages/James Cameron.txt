'''James Cameron''' is a Hollywood director and deep-sea explorer who appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Raising the Bar]]". The plot was a reference to James's record-setting solo dive into the Mariana trench on March 26, 2012.

==Background==
With the help of his crew of the [[USS James Cameron]], James travels to the lowest depths of the ocean to raise "[[The Bar|the bar]]" on society's acceptance of "[[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]" as well as obesity. The "[[Ballad of James Cameron]]" about his expedition plays twice in the episode.

==Appearance==
James Cameron has gray hair and a gray beard. He wears a black shirt, a black and blue deep-sea diving suit, black gloves, black diving pants, and black shoes.

Unlike other Canadian celebrities on the show, he has the traditional appearance of a South Park character rather than the beady-eyed look of many Canadian characters.
