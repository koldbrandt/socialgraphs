'''Chad''' is one of the [[Hopeful Hills]] campers in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Fat Camp]]".

==Background==
[[File:Chad.png|thumb|left|Chad crying because he cannot lose weight.]]Chad first appears buying candy that [[Eric Cartman]] sells to the campers during lights out. Chad cries, saying he does not want to eat any candy because he swore to his mother that he would lose weight, but he cannot control himself when he sees candy in front of him. He has been unable to lose weight even after going to seven weight loss camps. At the end of the episode, the campers' parents, including [[Chad's Parents ("Fat Camp")|his]], come to pick their children up because they are not losing weight at the camp. Chad feels guilty and finally admits that Cartman had been secretly selling candy to the campers and it is not [[Rick and Susan|the counselors]]' fault.

==Appearance==
Chad wears a short-sleeved white shirt with the fat camp logo, blue shorts and black shoes. Outside the camp he wears a green shirt, brown shorts, white socks and black shoes. He has red hair and freckles and is overweight like the rest of the campers.

==Personality==
Chad seems to be very worried about his weight; he even cried for not being able to resist eating candy. He also had the courage to own up to eating candy at the end of the episode.
