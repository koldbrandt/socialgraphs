'''Paul Watson''' is a Canadian animal rights activist, appearing as Captain of the "Sea Shepherd" in the episode "[[Whale Whores]]". He is up against the Japanese, who have been killing dolphins and whales. The person he is based on in real life, hosts a television show of his own, called ''[[Whale Wars]]''.

==Background==
In a parody of his controversial methods, involving the misrepresentation of events, to deceive the audience, Watson is depicted as an idiotic, glory-hound in search of getting attention for his show in the most pathetic means possible. When faced with an actual Japanese whaling ship, he suggests that they beat themselves up, in order to lie about being attacked. He also suggests that the crew throw rancid butter at the Japanese ship. After the butter is thrown, Watson is killed when a harpoon, shot from the Japanese ship, goes through his head, pinning him to the wall. This caused [[Stan Marsh]] to step up and take over command of the ship. Stan then shoots the Japanese boat's fuel supply with a flare gun, thus blowing it up and causing it to sink. Stan's more proactive approach to anti-whaling made him a more popular TV persona than Paul Watson.

Watson later appeared in episodes "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" alive, as part of the group of celebrities filing a class action lawsuit against [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

==Appearance==
Paul Watson is grossly overweight. He wears olive colored cargo pants, black boots, a black belt, and a black hoodie sweater with a white skull design. He has white hair and a white mustache. Due to his weight, his blood flow is inhibited, causing redness on his nose and cheeks.

==Personality==
Paul Watson is portrayed as dishonest, hypocritical and incompetent. He seeks to gain notoriety with his cause with nonsensical methods, with the only aim of seeking to gain public attention, meaning he is very self-obsessed and fame-hungry rather than being truly concerned with his supposed environmental cause.

==Trivia==
Despite being a Canadian, he was not depicted like other Canadians in ''[[South Park]]''. Instead of having an egg-shaped flapping head like, for example [[Ike Broflovski]], he is fully defined with a normal head. The same applies to [[Tom Green]], [[Alanis Morissette]], the [[Star Wars Kid]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[James Cameron]].

==Prominence==
*"[[Whale Whores]]"
*"[[200]]" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.
*"[[201]]" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.
