The '''unnamed DJ''' appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]".

==Background==
The DJ is seen at the beginning of the episode announcing that the band [[Korn]] will be playing live on KOZY-FM. He asks [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] if they like KOZY-FM, Stan responds by saying that once he saw two guys kissing and that was the most gay thing he has ever seen in his life, until he saw Halloween KOZY-FM Haunt.

The DJ is later seen talking to [[Father Maxi]], when he asks him if he was enjoying the preparations at the docks, Maxi responds negatively saying that Halloween is a celebration of the occult, the DJ also asks what he thought of the band Korn, Maxi says that Korn is a group of devil worshipers who play violent music.

He is later seen telling Korn members that the Halloween Haunt has been canceled because of the [[Pirate Ghosts]].

==Appearance==
The DJ has big light brown hair from the 70s, a light brown beard and is usually seen wearing headphones. He wears a cyan shirt with a collar and two side pockets. He also wears dark green pants and black shoes.

He bares a similar resemblance to the WSPIC DJ seen in "[[Gluten Free Ebola]]", who also has brown hair in a big style, wears headphones,  has some facial hair, and wears a buttoned shirt, but as they work for two different stations and the WSPIC DJ is more heavyset, they seem to be different people.
