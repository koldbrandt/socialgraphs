She made a physical appearance in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Members Only]]" as one of the people wishing to leave for [[Mars]].

She was first mentioned in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" when Commander [[Danny Ganz]] tries to blast her new album at [[Mr. Mackey]]'s party to force the attendees out, unaware they are listening to the same music already and enjoying it, despite Ganz' declaration nobody could handle "that much Cher".

She is briefly seen hosting ''Sonny and Cher'' during a flashback scene in "[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]".

After [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s election victory, many people visit [[SpaceX]] to go to [[Mars]] in fear of [[TrollTrace.com]] releasing their internet histories to the public. Cher, along with [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], are among the group and join in on [[Elon Musk]]'s tour of [[SpaceX]].

==Personality==
Cher appears to be somewhat absent-minded, as she performs her songs, with no one around paying attention to her.

==Appearance==
Cher wears a black dress with white patterns and white fur edges. She is hunched forward and has blonde dyed hair.
