'''Sally Turner''', also referred to as '''Powder''', was first seen in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]" as part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, but has been seen in the [[South Park Elementary]] [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade class]] ever since. Sally worked with [[Kenny McCormick]] on the egg science project in "[[Follow That Egg!]]". As of later seasons, she appears to have been demoted to a background character.

==Appearance==
Sally has similar hair and clothes to two other females in her class, most notably [[Red]] and [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]]. She wears a navy blue sweater with a pink pocket and sea green trousers, as many of her female classmates do. Her hair is similar to that of Red's, except that Sally lacks bangs, and she has a pink clip tying her hair back on the right.

It is possible she wears a bra, despite her age, and stuffs it. However, chances are she does not, as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the others on the ''Sexy Action News'' squad in "[[Quest for Ratings]]" claimed they should "make up stories of kids and present it on the news".

In her first appearance she wore a normal sweater, though she wears one with a pouch in all of her appearances afterward. The pouch was initially yellow, but episodes in [[Season Five]] and on depict it as being bright pink. When she was into the "whore" fad in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", she wore a lavender crop-top and a matching skirt and shoes. Sally was unique, being the only child character with red eyebrows, but in recent seasons they have become black, matching the other children.

A version of Sally with grey hair appeared in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', it is not known if this was Sally. It was likely a different character entirely as Sally is used as a [[Linda Triscotti|character model]] for crowd scenes.
