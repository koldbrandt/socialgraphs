The '''6th Grader with Green Shirt''' is a [[South Park Elementary]] student who first appeared in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Clubhouses]]" where he attends the party at [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s club house.

==Background==
He made a most notable appearance on "[[Fourth Grade]]", where he, along with two other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]], are seen bullying [[The Boys|the boys]] in the school hallways. He says he's on the 5th grade in this episode.

He was seen along with the other 6th graders in "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]" to pick up a porn tape that the boys were carrying.

His last notable appearance was in "[[Pre-School]]" where he and the other 6th graders promise to defend the boys from being attacked by [[Trent Boyett]] if they bring a photo of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mother]]'s breasts. The boys then bring the photo (which was actually a photo of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ass), the 6th Graders then try to fight Trent Boyett but end up failing.

==Personality==
His favorite hobbies are bullying the 4th graders and riding a bicycle, which he pretends to be a motorcycle. Like most other 6th graders, he doesn't seem to be very smart, as he thinks the photo the boys brought was really a photo of [[Sharon Marsh]]'s boobs. He seems to have stopped being a bully in recent episodes, as he is seen talking to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and two other 4th graders in "[[Stunning and Brave]]".

==Interactions==
===[[Bartles]] and the [[6th Grader with Black Hair and Blue Shirt]]===
He was seen alongside these two 6th Graders in a few episodes. In the episode "[[Fourth Grade]]" the three are seen pushing [[The Boys|the boys]] together and in the episode "[[About Last Night...]]" they are seen firing fireworks. The three are also seen at the end of the episode "[[Pre-School]]", but with the [[6th Grader Leader]] together.

==Appearance==
He is a short 6th grader with short light brown hair and thin eyebrows. He wears a bright lime green long-sleeved V-neck shirt, gray pants and black shoes.
