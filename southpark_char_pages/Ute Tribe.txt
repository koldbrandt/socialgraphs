The '''Ute Tribe''' is a tribe of Native Americans who reside in present-day Utah and Colorado. They made their only appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]".

==Background==
When [[Eric Cartman]] wants to know who his father is, he asks his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] who tells him about the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], where she met the Ute Tribe's [[Chief Running Water]]. This prompts Cartman to visit their reservation and talk to Chief Running Water, who tells him what happened after his encounter with Liane.

Though the entire tribe itself does not appear, Chief Running Water makes a brief non-speaking cameo appearance in "[[201]]".

==Appearance==
The Ute Tribe members wear multicolored shirts and pants. A few of them wear hats as well.
