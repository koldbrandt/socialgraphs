'''Suzette''' is the female mascot for the brand of alcoholic beverage [[S'more Schnapps]] who appears in the [[Season Three]] episode "[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]".

==Background==
After the people in the Confederate side of the Civil War reenactment go seven hours without drinking any S'more Schnapps, they proceed to head home. On the way home, two trucks full of S'more Schnapps pull up to the men along with the female mascot Suzette, who urges them to take another drink (from her cleavage). After doing so, the Confederate soldiers become drunk enough to take over Fort Sumter.

==Appearance==
Suzette has blonde hair tied into a hair bun on each side as well as blonde eyebrows. She wears a light blue dress (which exposes her large cleavage) with white trims and long black boots and is seen holding a bottle of S'more Schnapps in each hand. She has a voluptuous figure.
