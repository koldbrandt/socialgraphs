'''Alexandra Cartman''' is the niece of [[Liane Cartman]], the cousin of [[Eric Cartman]] and the alleged daughter of [[Uncle Stinky]] and [[Lisa Cartman]]. She made her first appearance at the dinner scene in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", and later appeared in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Cartmanland]]".

==Appearance==
[[File:Alexandra in South Park- Bigger, Longer & Uncut.png|left|thumb|Alexandra on the cover of "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]"''.'']]
Alexandra has long brown hair with bangs, and wears black mascara, red lipstick and has some freckles between her eyes. She also wears a white short-sleeved shirt with light brown edges, blue jeans and black shoes. At the end of the episode she is seen wearing a red Christmas hat. Alexandra is the second member of the Cartman family who is not overweight, like her [[Liane Cartman|aunt]]. Actually, if anything she seems to be underweight as she looks the same height as [[Shelly Marsh]], who is exact weight.

In "[[Cartmanland]]", she was wearing a black dress with pink edges.

==Trivia==
*According to the official script of "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", There would be a scene where [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] would wave to Alexandra, she would then roll her eyes. This scene however does not appear in the final episode.
**Also, she was called Alexandria in this part of the script, this was probably a typo.

==Prominence==
*"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]" - Seen eating dinner with her extended family.
*"[[Cartmanland]]" - Seen at the funeral for [[Mabel Cartman]].
