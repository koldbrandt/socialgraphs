The '''Security Guard''' is an unnamed character who works as a security guard at multiple locations in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He first appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]".

==Background==
In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", he teaches the ropes to a [[Rookie Security Guard]] at the [[South Park Mall]], despite obliviously letting a terrorist proceed with his plan to unleash anthrax upon all of North America. At the end, he seems to be the only person who enjoys [[Fingerbang]]'s [[Fingerbang (Song)|music]] while they performed on a stage in the mall.

He is later hired by [[Eric Cartman]] in "[[Cartmanland]]" to prevent unwanted guests into his theme park, especially [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He tells Cartman that he needs to let more people into the park in order to cover his salary and hire other employees to keep the theme park running.

==Personality==
The security guard has an aggressive demeanor with a tendency to threaten people and ask accusatory questions and then tell them to "move along, sir/ma'am" even when they may be dangerous. He also seems to pepper spray people for no reason. He seems to fear humiliation and have a deep sense of shame when he feels he has been humiliated.

==Appearance==
The security guard has light brown hair with a receding hairline and a mustache. He wears a uniform made up of alight blue shirt and dark blue pants. A black belt and black shoes.

==Trivia==
*He is referred to as "Old Mall Security" and "Older Mall Cop" in the script for "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", "Security Guy" in the script for "[[Cartmanland]]", and "Security Guard" in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.
*His model was reused for a different security guard character in "[[Free Willzyx]]".

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
The security guard is seen working as security for the gated community the [[Black Residence]] is in and fought by the [[The New Kid|Douchebag]] in a mandatory quest. The player must first acquire a gas mask from [[Jimbo's Guns]] to become immune to the security guard's pepper spray, thus forcing a battle. After he is defeated, he tells the New Kid that he cannot look at him without feelings of deep personal shame and plays no further role in the story.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
In the sequel to the ''Stick of Truth'', the security guard is still working as a security guard for the Black Residence, this time along with two other unnamed security guards and four different guard dogs. [[The New Kid|Butthole]] must fight him in order to gain entry into the Black Residence and arrest [[Steve Black]] who [[Sergeant Yates]] claims is a drug kingpin. When approached, the security guard will reveal himself from behind a bush and yell that he will "not be humiliated again!" and he will "fuck up" Butthole "non-lethally." He calls sin other guards who closely resemble him for backup during battle.
