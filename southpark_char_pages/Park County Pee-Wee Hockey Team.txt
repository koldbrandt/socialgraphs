The '''Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team''' is a kindergartner ice hockey team that appears in [[Season Ten]] episode "[[Stanley's Cup]]". 

==Background==
[[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s bike gets repoed due to unpaid parking tickets. To settle the ticket fees, he is forced to become the coach for the Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team, which he played for the team at age four. 

The players consist of kindergartners. Despite being a hockey team, the members are all poorly-skilled players.

The team competes in the [[Pee-Wee Hockey League]]. One of their members, Nelson, has cancer and expects the team to win the match. He counts on Stan to help train the team to win. Due to his medical condition, Stan assigns [[Ike Broflovski]] onto the team to substitute  for Nelson for the teams' next big match against the Denver Pee-Wee Hockey Team.

At their first game, they compete against the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]]. During the match, the players are shown to be very incompetent in the sport. None of the players made a score, and the game ends in a tie.

Later in the episode, after the team arrives at the stadium, the opponent team fails to show up. Instead, the [[Colorado Avalanche]] make the pee-wee team play for them against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].

The Kindergartners were severely injured due to their opponents being adults who are a lot taller, more experienced, and physically-shaped. As a result of their loss, Nelson loses hope and dies in his hospital bed.
