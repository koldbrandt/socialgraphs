'''Detective Jarvis''' appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, "[[The Return of Chef]]". He comes to [[South Park Elementary]] to talk to the children about [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]]'s recent pedophilic behavior, which was later revealed that it was from the brainwashing by the [[Super Adventure Club]]. He says that he wants to collect testimony from the children, but only shows how a pedophile would treat them.

==Appearance==
He has brown hair, which he combs back, and wears a black suit with a dark red tie and a yellow badge.

His character model was reused with modified coloration, no badge, and a more youthful face, as weatherman [[Keenan Williams]] in "[[Smug Alert!]]".

==Personality==
He seems to take his demonstrations very seriously, demonstrating the actions of pedophiles with unusual enthusiasm. He also seems very childish when convinced of something, as shown from his responses to [[Stan Marsh]] refusing that Chef is a pedophile.
