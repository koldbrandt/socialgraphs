'''Christophe''', also known as '''The Mole''', is a bitter French nine year old with an expertise in covert operations and an intense hatred of [[God]]. He appeared in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

==Background==
In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', [[Gregory]] told [[the boys]] to procure the Mole's help in saving [[Terrance and Phillip]]. The Mole helps the boys infiltrate the USO show, but the mission fails after Cartman forgets to shut down the base's security system. As a result, the Mole is fatally injured by a group of army attack dogs.

As he died, he sang "[[The Mole's Reprise]]", while Kyle held him and softly eased him into death. At his moment of passing away, The Mole continued his pattern of hatred towards God. The Mole, like everyone else who died in the war, was presumably brought back to life after [[Kenny McCormick]]'s wish to Satan.

He made a brief cameo appearance in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]", where he is seen on ''[[Conan O'Brien|Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', while Stan channel surfs.

==Appearance==
He has an unkempt appearance and carries a shovel with him on his back. He dresses in dark green and brown camouflage and wears fingerless gloves. He has messy brown hair, a prematurely lined face and prominent ears. He has bags under his eyes and thick eyebrows. He is usually seen smoking a cigarette.

==Personality==
The Mole smokes cigarettes, is foul-mouthed, and has an outspoken grudge against [[God]], whom he blames for everything wrong with the world. He displays a tough exterior and appears to have a jaded outlook, as well as being abrasive towards others. He also appears to be manic and emotionally unstable. He also expresses a hatred for guard dogs. His character is influenced by Grantaire from Les Misérables, just as Gregory is similar to Enjolras, although his song, "The Mole's Reprise" also parallels Éponine's "A Little Fall of Rain".

==Family==
The only family member to appear on-screen is his mother.
===[[Christophe's Mother]]===
The Mole does not appear to have a very good relationship with his mother. According to the Mole, his mother attempted an abortion by stabbing him in the heart with a clothes hanger while he was still in her womb. He does appear to be intimidated by his mother, still doing as she says. His mother does not agree with his misotheism, often grounding him for saying bad things about God.

==Interactions==

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
Kyle showed a certain amount of concern for the Mole's safety, advising him to be careful when infiltrating the USO show. Later on, as the Mole lay dying, Kyle attempted to give him solace, easing him into death. Notably, they also shared a short duet, "[[The Mole's Reprise]]".

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
Stan seemed to think that the Mole was a little crazy, saying to Kyle, "Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up." Earlier on, the Mole momentarily throttled Stan and interrogated him as to who sent them.

===[[Eric Cartman]]===
When the Mole instructed Cartman to turn off the alarms, he repeated it, implying that the Mole thinks Cartman is a bad listener. In that same minute, Cartman called him a "British piece of shit". When the Mole died, Cartman just watched on, and did not seem to show much concern. So from all this, we can safely assume that the two have rivalry problems with each other. Although that last backup could also be from Cartman's selfish and manipulative personality.

===[[God]]===
The Mole blames God for everything that is wrong with the world. Throughout the movie, The Mole refers to God as a "faggot" and "bitch". Upon his death he continues to loathe God but seems to believe his meeting with God is inevitable.

===[[Gregory]]===
Although they never appear on-screen together in the final film, the Mole is implied to have had previous contact with [[Gregory]], who personally recommended the boys procure his help in the upcoming operation to free [[Terrance and Phillip]].

In the [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/south-park.html official eighth draft] for the movie, Gregory introduces Christophe to the others with Christophe digging underneath the ground similar to how Bugs Bunny would. Gregory tells everybody about the things The Mole does, with The Mole responding negatively to most of what's said. However, this part was cut out, and we see Stan, Kyle and Cartman walking to his house and meeting him there.

==Quotes==
The Mole speaks with a heavy French accent, and often refers to other people as "bitches". His catchphrase is "Shit!", which in his accent actually sounds closer to "Sheet!"

All quotes are from ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.
