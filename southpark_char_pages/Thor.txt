'''Thor Odinson '''is a Marvel character who stars in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. He appears in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, "[[Band in China]]".

==Background==
He is seen as one of the Marvel characters aboard the flight to [[China]] along with [[Randy Marsh]].

Later on, Thor was one of the Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars characters getting scolded by [[Mickey Mouse]] for criticizing the Chinese Government and being critical of Chinese politics. He argues that it is indeed true that the Chinese Government does exploit its people to do labor in forced labor campuses. Mickey is displeased and tells him to shut up, telling him he is in China because he is here to make profit and look cool, and not to think.
