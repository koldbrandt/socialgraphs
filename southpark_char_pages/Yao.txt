==Personality==
He appears to have an obsession with Dance Dance Revolution as he plays it everyday after school and has, so far, spent about $6000 on it. As for the rest of his personality, he appears to be kind and supportive, agreeing to give his time up to help Stan with very little coercion. He also appears to care about his reputation, becoming upset when he realized that he might "get served" at the Dance Off in "[[You Got F'd in the A]]" .

==Relationships==
===[[Stan Marsh]]===
He joined Stan's dance troop in "[[You Got F'd in the A]]" and they presumably befriended each other during the short time they were seen together.
