'''Lola''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]], who first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Chinpokomon]]". She was initially voiced by Jessie Thomas and now by [[April Stewart]]. She is also a member of "the popular girls" clique in the class, along with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red McArthur|Red]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Nelly]], [[Esther]] and others; the most frequent being [[Jenny Simons]].

==Background==
Lola was initially a background character, first appearing in "[[Chinpokomon]]" next to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] at the [[Chinpokomon Camp]], then in [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]" at the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]]. She later appears in "[[AWESOM-O]]", where she is watching an embarrassing video of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] cosplaying as [[Britney Spears]] and dancing with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cutout; she is seen sitting in front of [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]] and next to [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]]. Lola has almost no appearances between this and the later episode, "[[Follow That Egg!]]", where she was paired with [[Token Black|Token]] in the class project where they had to take care of an egg. She is frequently seen with Red.

In "[[The List]]", she is one of the heads of the list committee and conspires with Bebe, Red, and Jenny Simons to make [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] popular so they can get free shoes. However, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] manage to foil their plot. Since this episode, she has been seen frequently as one of the more main girls in episodes such as "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]".

==Appearance==
Her long, brown hair is styled in a side part with bangs, and held back by a dark blue headband. She wears a plain, long-sleeved green shirt and a pair of dark gray pants. She has also been seen wearing blue pants in place of gray ones.

She is seen wearing plum gloves as the kids step outside to watch the fight in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]".

==Family==
Lola's father can be seen with her in "[[Safe Space]]". Her mother can also be seen walking with her at the mall in "[[Margaritaville]]".

==Interactions==
===[[Butters Stotch]]===
Lola showed a lot of admiration for [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]" after seeing his talents in literature, saying he is brooding and full of angst.

However, she can be heard in the crowd encouraging [[Nelly]] to take down Butters as they attempt to fight in "[[Douche and a Danish]]", implying that Lola disapproves of Butters' decision to start the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement, as do the rest of the girls.

===[[Bebe Stevens]]===
Bebe and Lola appear to be good friends. Lola, in defense of Bebe, called Wendy out for disapproving of Bebe's decision to date Clyde in order to receive free shoes in "[[The List]]".

They are also partnered together for the field trip in "[[Super Fun Time]]" and can be seen eating lunch together in the hallway in "[[Bass to Mouth]]". Lola is invited to Bebe's sleepover in "[[Cartman Finds Love]]" and can also be seen hanging with Bebe, along with Wendy, in a portrait hung in Bebe's bedroom in "[[Skank Hunt]]".

===[[Jenny Simons]]===
Jenny is Lola's best friend. They are seen sitting together at the [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]] in "[[The List]]", and Jenny defends Lola from Wendy's lashing out by stating that they would generate a "biggest liars" list and put Wendy at #1.

They are also seen walking home together in "[[Cartman Finds Love]]" and later gossip about Kyle's rumored homosexuality whilst on the cheerleading team.

===[[Wendy Testaburger]]===
Wendy did not have such a positive encounter with Lola when they first interacted in "[[The List]]", in fact, she lashed out at her for justifying to make Clyde the most popular boy at school just to get free shoes. As a result, Lola receives a groin attack from her.

Despite this, Lola has often been shown as part of the popular girls' clique with Wendy in later episodes, and even appears in a portrait with Wendy and Bebe that was hung in Bebe's bedroom.
