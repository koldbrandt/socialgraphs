'''K-10''' was [[Eric Cartman]]'s robot dog in the [[Season Ten]] episode, "[[Go God Go XII]]".

==Background==
Cartman froze himself waiting for the Nintendo Wii to be released but was revived 500 years in the future. His only friend is a robot dog named K-10.

When the two steal a [[Crank Prank Time Phone]] to warn his past self about the danger of freezing himself, his past self does not believe him. After repeatedly making calls to the past, his surroundings change. K-10 becomes a cat robot named [[KIT-9]], and then a robot bird, called [[KOK-A-3]].

==Appearance==
K-10 is a bipedal robot with canine features. It is mostly gold colored, with black flexible joints, black ears, and chrome hands and feet.

==Trivia==
*The K-10 robot is a reference of to the robots Twiki in the 1970s TV show, ''Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'' and K-9 from the ''Doctor Who'' series and its many spin-offs.
