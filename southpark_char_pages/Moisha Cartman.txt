==Background==
Following a lockdown on [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] due to a new [[COVID-19]] variant, the Cartmans requested to stay in [[Broflovski Residence|Kyle's house]] for the night, with the children pleading "Please, Uncle Kyle." With [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] accepting their request, Moisha goes up to Kyle and says "Toda raba" ("thank you" in Hebrew) as a word of thanks.

As Kyle, Cartman, and Token were discussing about Kenny's death, Kyle calls out Cartman who is making out with [[Yentl Cartman|his wife]] in front of the group, triggering Moisha to cuss out on Kyle for the first time.

==Appearance==
