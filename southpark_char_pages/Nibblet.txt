'''Nibblet''' is the animal mascot for the rock band [[Korn]]. He appears in "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]". Nibblet does not seem to serve a purpose and is shown being extremely clumsy, but he helped capture the pirate ghosts in a net (only to have them dissipate shortly after).

==Appearance==
Nibblet is a yellow, anthropomorphic bird-like creature with large wings, a red nose, an oddly-shaped head featuring springy antennae, and a short body. He can sometimes be seen with a bag of potato chips.
==Quotes==
'''Nibblet''': "Nibblet likes potato chips." from "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]"

==Trivia==
*Nibblet and the design of Korn band members was a homage to the Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[wikipedia:Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You]]'' that ran from 1969 to 1972.
*A purple Nibblet toy can be seen being destroyed by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in the episode "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", when he goes into a frenzy and breaks all of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' toys in his bedroom.
*Nibblet's name was likely derived from "Niblet", a term for a single kernel of corn.
