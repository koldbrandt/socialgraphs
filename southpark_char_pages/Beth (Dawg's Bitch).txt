:''For the background character, See [[Beth]].''
'''Beth''' worked as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s "bitch" in the [[Season Ten]] episode, "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]". She is a part of Cartman's hall monitor group, which parodies ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'', but does not speak.

She is based on Beth Chapman, the wife of Dog. Chapman died from cancer in 2019.

==Appearance==
Beth's body shape is similar to Cartman's. She appears to have defined eyebrows, her eyes are almost completely covered by her massive breasts, which is unusual as she is a child. She has long blond hair and massive breasts covering half of her face. She wears a black shirt, gray pants, and a pink bra. She has short, stubby hands that rise above her head.

==Personality==
She does not have a distinguishable persona, as she has never had any speaking roles. It is implied that she is somewhat cruel, as she was not against bear macing people without a reason when ordered to. She may be somewhat intelligent, as she was able to track down [[Ms. Stevenson]]'s Travelocity account and her hotel room.
