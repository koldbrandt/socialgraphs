'''200 Pregnant Mexican Women''' appeared in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Stunning and Brave]]".

==Background==
The 200 Pregnant Mexican Women were one of the stages in Cartman's plan to get rid of the [[PC Principal]] and the PC Delta fraternity in "[[Stunning and Brave]]".

The plan consists of several stages of increasingly offensive, outrageous stereotypes and behavior in order to create chaos and violence among the PC bros, ultimately leading to the death of the PC Delta fraternity.

The plan starts by using pregnant Mexican women to eat the tacos launched by the taco launchers, who then fall asleep and give birth to anchor babies. The PC bros would continue to be further distracted by a flood of [[Syrian Refugee Children]], who would then be chased by [[Jared Fogle]], who is intent on molesting them.

==Appearance==
All of the women have varying appearances. However, they are all Hispanic and are very visibly pregnant. Some of the women are seen wearing maternity dresses and skirts, while some wear active pants and maternity shirts.
