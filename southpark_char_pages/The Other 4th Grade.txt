Several children are known to be in the larger '''[[The 4th Grade|4th Grade]]''' class at [[South Park Elementary]], but are not seen attending [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class on a regular basis.

==Background==
In most episodes, Mr. Garrison's class is referred to as 'the fourth grade' on an informal basis and he is often known as 'the fourth grade teacher', as if they are the only such class; but multiple episodes confirm there or are other fourth grade classes with additional students. Characters who have appeared in the classroom only on certain isolated occasions are generally not considered to be members of the main 4th Grade class and are also listed here.

In "[[Proper Condom Use]]", the boys' class is separated into two different rooms by male and female students, with the male students using a different fourth grade classroom. The regular teacher and students of this room are not seen or referenced. The boys' fourth grade boys are joined by [[Nate]] and [[Boy with Red Shirt and Blue Pants]].

An additional fourth grade class is shown entering the hallway in "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]". It appears to be made up of the students who were in the main class in third grade but not the fourth grade, including [[Bill Allen]], [[Jason White]], [[Boy with Red Shirt and Blue Pants]], [[Brimmy]] and [[DogPoo Petuski]]. The classroom interior has not been seen. 

In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", Cartman mentions another fourth grade teacher named Mr. Bart (in reference to one of his students, [[Pete Melman]]) who may or may not teach this class. It is unknown if he teachers either of the above classes or a separate one.

A new fourth grade classroom appears in "[[The Pandemic Special]]" during the school's quarantine. The students seen in the classroom are [[Nate]], [[Brimmy]], [[Lannie]], [[Francis]], [[Tommy Turner]], [[Andrew Sutherland]], [[Monica Ryland]], [[Daniel Tanner]], [[Isla]], [[Theresa]], the [[Girl with Blonde Hair|girl with blonde hair]], and an unnamed red-haired girl.

Several other children are also known to be in the fourth grade but are not known to attend South Park Elementary. They presumably attend another school, do not attend school at all, or simply have not been seen at South Park Elementary.

==Classrooms==

There are multiple fourth grade classrooms seen throughout the series, and at least three have been seen.

The inside of a fourth grade classroom is seen in "[[Proper Condom Use]]" when the boys are sent in a separate room to learn about sex education with [[Mr. Mackey]] while the girls stay in the normal fourth grade classroom. It has posters of sex education and a darker decor. 

In "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]", multiple fourth graders (see above) appear to be exiting a classroom across the boys' classroom, though this room appears to house different grades in other episodes based on story convenience.

The new fourth grade classroom seen in "[[The Pandemic Special]]" has pink walls on which there is a board with U.S historical figures, a political U.S map, a clock in the middle, a photo with a spaceship, and multiple golden stars. It also has multiple bookshelves and a big cabinet.

[[The 4th Grade|4th Grade]] students who are not seen in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class regularly but are known to attend [[South Park Elementary]] are listed here. These students may have been seen in assemblies, hallways or other group shots set at the school but not in Mr. Garrison's class. Some have appeared in Mr. Garrison's class to fill seats on certain isolated occasions, but are generally not considered members of his class.

Many additional background characters are often identified as fourth graders based on build or association, some of which have never been seen in a classroom or at [[South Park Elementary]], or are explicitly known not to attend the school. As third and fourth grades share a very similar model, and some fat characters' ages are less clear, the exact grades/ages for characters such as the [[Christophe]], [[Goth Kids]], [[Loogie]], or [[Rebecca Cotswolds]] cannot be verified.
