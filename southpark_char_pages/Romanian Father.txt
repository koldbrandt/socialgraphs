The '''Romanian Father''' is the father of the [[Quintuplets]]. He appears in "[[Quintuplets 2000]]", where he was held at gunpoint and forced to ask the U.S. government to return the quintuplets to [[Romania]].

==Appearance==
He has messy brown hair, a "five o'clock shadow", and a brown mustache. He wears a green, dotted cap, brown coat, and white shirt.

==Personality==
He is presumably neglectful, not knowing how to pronounce one of his daughter's names. According to one of the quintuplets, they have not seen him in five years.

==Trivia==
*He is sometimes known as '''Mr. Vladchik''' like the girls' grandmother, but there is no evidence this is their father's side of the family.
