'''Cornwallis Hankey''' is one of [[Mr. Hankey]]'s children. He is presumed very smart, but he is conflicted with being a poo. He appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]" and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

==Appearance==
Cornwallis is a talking piece of excrement with an orange and blue hat, glasses, gloves and an orange scarf.

==Personality==
Cornwallis is deeply conflicted by being a poo, he does not see the bigger picture. His father, Mr. Hankey, sings him [[Circle of Poo|a song]] about it but later reveals he only did so because he wanted to "stop his bitchin'".

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
Cornwallis plays a minor role in Mr. Hankey's quest [[Dropping the Kids Off]]. The New Kid must rescue him from hobos, who are using him for an entertainment "Shit Show", and return him to his parents.

==Prominence==
*"[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]" - First appearance. Briefly loses his Christmas spirit until [[Mr. Hankey]] sings to him "[[Circle of Poo]]".
*"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]" - Seen in the crowd of people along with the rest of his family.

==Trivia==
*Cornwallis sings with the voice of ex-Temptation Louis Price in "Circle of Poo", but with the high-pitched tones that Trey Parker gives to Mr Hankey when he sings "[[Santa Claus is On His Way]]" when on display to the hobos in the game.
