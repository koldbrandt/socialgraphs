The '''Boy with Green Shirt''' is a student at South Park Elementary who appears in some episodes as a background character, but had a big role in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Faith Hilling]]" where he and his friends were seen taking photos of him in front of [[Café Monet]] doing a popular meme called "[[List of Memes#"Taylor Swifting"|Taylor Swifting]]". He was later seen encouraging [[Stan Marsh]] to perform a combination of two memes, "Taylor Swifting" and "[[List of Memes#"Oh Long Johnsoning" + "Taylor Swifting"|Oh Long Johnsoning]]" in front of the same cafe.

==Appearance==
The boy with green shirt has short brown hair with buzzed sides. He wears black shoes, gray pants, a white shirt, and a green hooded jacket. In several other episodes he is seen wearing a pale green shirt similar to Tweek's.

In "[[Raising the Bar]]", his attire was changed slightly. In addition to his usual attire, he wore a blue Disney cap with [[Mickey Mouse]] ears and a Disneyland patch on his coat.
