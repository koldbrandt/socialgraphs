==Personality==
He was portrayed as nice and slightly over-trusting, even befriending [[Butters Stotch]] and going to his house, despite only knowing Butters for a few hours.

==Family==
===Parents===
Baahir's parents, [[Mr. Hakeem]] and [[Mrs. Hakeem]], were kidnapped by Cartman when he was trying to find out the location of their son. He then tortured them by farting in their faces. When they refused to respond, professing that they did not know where Baahir was, Cartman then injected his arm with a syringe full of apple juice, warning them that apple juice gives him "super bad farts". He left them tied up and imprisoned after he found out that Baahir was at Butters' house. Due to their abominable experiences in South Park, the Hakeems moved away at the end of the episode. Cartman rejoiced at this, saying that not only did his bigotry save the country from the real terrorist attacks, but it also got rid of the Muslim family.

==Interactions==
===[[Butters Stotch]]===
Immediately after moving to South Park, he makes a fast relationship with Butters and, after he is forced to move away by his parents, Butters is the only person who is visibly disappointed.

===[[Eric Cartman]]===
When Baahir first moved to [[South Park]], Cartman immediately suspected him of being a terrorist, presumably because of his race and religion. Cartman went so far as to ask [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] to have Baahir checked for bombs. It turned out that Baahir was not a terrorist, although Cartman's bigoted behavior towards him contributed to saving America from a real terrorist attack, which was going underway at the time.

==Trivia==
*Although Baahir's surname is supposed to be "Hakeem", when Kyle reads Baahir's Myspace page, it lists him as "Bahir Habeem". It also says his name is Mohammed Lamed elsewhere on the page.
*Baahir's MySpace page lists him as 8 years of age. However, to be eligible to register for the site, one must be 13 years of age.
