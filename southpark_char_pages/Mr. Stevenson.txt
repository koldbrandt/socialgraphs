'''Mr. Stevenson''' is a car salesman, selling [[Hummer]] vehicles at [[Stevenson's Hummer]]. He first appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Obama Wins!]]".

==Background==
In "[[Obama Wins!]]", he is seen advertising his vehicles and conducting a sale at his car lot called 'Roctvember Sales Event'.

In the end, [[The Boys|the boys]], the [[Park County Police Force]], [[General Tso]], and [[Eric Cartman]] visit Stevenson's Hummer to locate the [[Missing Election Ballots|missing election ballots]]. The salesman naively mistakes this predicament as a sudden rush of clients, citing it to be a 'sales rush'.

Mr. Stevenson returns in "[[Handicar]]" where he is seen trying to compete in the Wacky Races.

In "[[Sons A Witches]]", he makes a cameo in the background when the other witches corner [[Chip Duncan|Chip]].

==Appearance==
Mr. Stevenson wears brown dress shoes, black business pants, a black belt with a gold buckle, and a blue shirt with a blue, striped tie. He has wavy, light brown hair and a similar colored goatee. His shirt has a tag saying "HUMMER" in red letters.
