==Personality==
Vanessa is an emotionally distraught, timid, and vulnerable woman, given her daughter's terrible behavior, along with her daughter's constant physical and emotional abuse towards her. She is also too weak to stand up to her daughter and discipline her, which is why she turns to Maury for desperate help. Vanessa often cries and is horrified to hear the shocking details of her daughter's immoral and illegal deeds, as well as Cartman's fabricated claims.
