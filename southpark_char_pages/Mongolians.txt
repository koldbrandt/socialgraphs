The '''Mongolians''' appear in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]", and in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

==Background==
The Mongolians persistently break down [[City Wok]] owner [[Tuong Lu Kim]]'s city wall. Lu Kim was requested to build the wall to keep intruders from abducting [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s children. Eventually, the children are sent away and join the Mongolians, due to their parents' increasing paranoia and overprotectiveness. Even though the Mongolians didn't want to abduct all the children of South Park, they just wanted to have them to become part of their group to break down the city wall. The Mongolians are able to break down the city wall once more with the use of explosives planted by the children.

It is explained by [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] that the Mongolians' justification in destroying the wall is that "putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together."

==Appearance==
They all wear 13th-century-style clothing, have squinting eyes, and have long mustaches and beards. They carry swords as well as wooden shields.

==Personality==
The Mongolians appear to be intelligent, easily outsmarting Lu Kim several times. Despite the fact that they destroy the wall several times, they never enter [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The only reason given for their attacking the wall is that Mongolians try to break down any wall built by Chinese people.

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
The Mongolians are encountered as enemies in the [[Mongolian Beef]] side quest. At the top of the [[Tower of Peace]] are 5 Mongolian cavalry, but they are counted as one single enemy.

===Abilities===

*'''Sweet and Sour Surprise''' - Throws a pot of sweet and sour sauce. Inflicts burning if not blocked.
*'''Blacken the Skies''' - Cast an arrow rain. Inflicts bleeding if not blocked.
