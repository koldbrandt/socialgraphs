The '''Catholic Clean-up Crew''' is a group, which destroys evidence of priests molesting young children. They appeared only in the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode, "[[A Boy And A Priest]]".

==Background==
Their expertise is to clean a crime scene after the pedophilic activity of a Catholic priest and presumably dispose of any evidence. They utilize standard cleaning equipment but also use a backpack machine called the "Kumby" and a Zamboni called the "Kumboni", which is a reference to Daniele Comboni. All members were run over and killed by [[Father Maxi]] after they offered him a fine life away from town but implying his replacement would be a sexual predator.

After assuming Maxi was on a debaucherous and criminal molestation rampage, they cleaned the [[South Park Church]], [[Marsh Residence|Stan's house]] and the [[Kidzone Roller Rink]]. They have a van containing their cleaning equipment but it was also used to lure [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and lure or kidnap [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] to set a trap for Maxi.

==Appearance==
The bishop of the crew is overweight, he wears glasses, a white robe, a short pink cloak, a hat in the same color, and a golden cross.

The person that drives the "Kumboni" is a strong and fierce man, he is in black robes, he has grey hair and also wears a cross.

The person who blows the "priest call" whistle wears a white robe with gold designs on it, he has glasses, brown hair and beard.
