'''John Arthur Carradine''' was an American actor who appeared in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Dead Celebrities]]".

==Background==
David Carradine was one of the few ghosts which haunted [[Ike Broflovski]]. He was later seen among the dead celebrities that were held back on board a purgatory plane when [[Michael Jackson]] refused to accept his death. After Michael Jackson had done so, the passengers were flown to [[Hell]], and expressed their dismay when they found that Hell was a tow-in gate.

Carradine was mentioned in "[[Sexual Healing]]", when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] are warned that if they continue on their path of "sex addiction", they may end up dead from auto-erotic asphyxiation just like Carradine. This ends up true for Kenny.

==Appearance==
David Carradine has long gray hair. He was seen wearing only the bottom half of a black bondage suit, with a noose tied to his neck. His appearance in the episode is a reference to his real life death as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
