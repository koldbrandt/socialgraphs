{{LinkDisambig|Robert (Disambiguation)}}
'''Robert "Bob" White''' is the husband of [[Mrs. White]] and the father of [[Jason White|Jason]] and [[Crystal White]]. He and his wife are ardent supporters of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]], earning the White family an awful reputation in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He first appeared as the co-main antagonist of the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, "[[Splatty Tomato]]."

==Background==
After Crystal had a "nightmare" about the [[Herbert Garrison|president]] coming to get her, the Whites confronted the [[South Park Elementary|school]], making the assumption that the school staff was forcing their political opinions on their children in order to scare them, and went to speak to [[PC Principal]] and [[Strong Woman]] to address it.

==Appearance==
Mr. White has pale brown hair that is gray on the sides, and is noticeably approaching baldness. He has arched lips just like his wife, and erase lines around his mouth. He wears a dark red v-neck sweater over a gray shirt, khaki pants, and white shoes. 

==Personality==
Bob White is a satire on many supporters of the 45th president of the United States, [[Donald Trump]]. Mr. White is actively dedicated to President Garrison, even leaving food out on his front door to feed Garrison as he hid from the [[Canada|Canadians]] in South Park and allowing him to torment his children in the process. He is slightly petulant, and a little stubborn, refusing to believe Garrison was capable of doing any wrong in spite of the tower of evidence stacked up against him. Mr. White is also personally offended at how little the town ever cared for or acknowledged the White family.

==Prominence==
*"[[Splatty Tomato]]" - Confronts the school about their qualms with the staff voicing their liberal opinions to their children.
*"[[Season Finale]]" - His son Jason gets killed by police and the family adopt a new child, [[Alejandro]], from the ICE. He is later seen fighting for [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s freedom.
*"[[Basic Cable]]" - He and his family appear in the show "Blacks vs Whites" during the random streaming series scene.
*"[[Christmas Snow]]" - Loses his "Christmas Spirit" after liquor is prohibited during the holidays, but cheers up after Randy comes up with his Christmas special.
*"[[The Pandemic Special]]" - Appeared in a Zoom conference with [[Mr. Mackey]] and other parents.
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Appears as the main antagonist with tutoring and causing issues. By the end of the episode, he has been digitally transformed into an oversized flowering penis.
