'''Ryan Valmer''' is [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s father and [[Sarah Valmer]]'s husband. He is the Chief of the Fire Department for the City Council in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. Mr. Valmer appears first in the episode, "[[Krazy Kripples]]" along with Mrs. Valmer as they suspect that Jimmy has joined a gang.

==Appearance==
Ryan wears a blue shirt with a greenish-blue tie, underneath a red sweater with a blue and orange diamond pattern at the bottom. He also wears dark green trousers. His hair is brown, and he seems to have a slight double chin.

==Personality==
Ryan is shown to be very concerned for Jimmy's welfare, asking him if he joined a gang when he hears rumors that Jimmy is involved in a gang society in "[[Krazy Kripples]]". Ryan seems to be rather nosy, as in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", he kept poking into Jimmy's room, asking if he was masturbating. He also seems to be clueless for in "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]", he suggests to give the homeless designer sleeping bags and makeovers so they'll be easier to look at. Ryan and his wife both believe that their son's disability is a punishment from God, as they used to make fun of disabled children while in high school.
