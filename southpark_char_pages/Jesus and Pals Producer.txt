The '''''Jesus and Pals'' Producer''' appeared in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]".

==Background==
She is the producer for ''[[Jesus and Pals]]'', [[Jesus]]' reality talk show on [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] public access television. When ''Jesus and Pals'' go into a rating war with [[Jimbo]] and [[Ned]]'s ''[[Huntin' and Killin']]'' show, Jesus is not too concerned but she would do anything to improve the show's ratings. Under her influence, the show gets increasingly raunchy and inappropriate. A commercial for ''Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV! '' features topless bikini-clad women and guests yelling obscenities.

After Jimbo and Ned learn that the Mexican Staring Frog is not real, Jimbo, Ned, and [[the boys]] star on ''Jesus and Pals''. During a break, the producer goes behind Jesus' back and tells Jimbo to lie that Stan is a drug addict. A fight breaks out on the show and Jesus finds out the truth. He then fires her and sends her to [[Hell]], where she meets [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]].

==Personality==
She is greedy and corrupt; compromising truth and morality for the sake of getting higher ratings and earnings.

==Appearance==
The ''Jesus and Pals'' producer has light brown shoulder-length hair, visible eyelashes, red lipstick, and is visibly aged. She wears a pair of brown sunglasses on her head, a green shirt, and a dark green skirt with a side slit.
