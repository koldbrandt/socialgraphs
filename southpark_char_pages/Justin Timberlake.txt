'''Justin Randall Timberlake''' is an American musician and actor. 

==Background==
While Justin has not technically appeared on ''[[South Park]]'' as an actual character, a cardboard cutout of Justin appeared in the episode "[[AWESOM-O]]", where it was revealed [[Butters Stotch]], in order to get vengeance against [[Eric Cartman]] for years of bullying, had videotaped Cartman dressed up as [[Britney Spears]], dancing with the cut-out as he sang "[[Touch My Body]]".

Butters himself would later dance to Timberlake's song, "Rock Your Body" in "[[Marjorine]]", while posing as a girl to steal a "future-telling device" from the popular girls.

==Appearance==
The cutout was photo-realistic. It was made to look like it was wearing a black coat, black pants, black-and-white sneakers, a white tie, and a green "dress" shirt.

==Prominence==
*"[[AWESOM-O]]" - Cartman, dressed up as Britney Spears, dances with a cardboard cutout of Justin Timberlake in an embarrassing video he recorded.
*"[[Wing]]" - Mentioned only.
*"[[Marjorine]]" - [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]] and the girls dance to Justin Timberlake's song "[[Rock Your Body]]" at [[Heidi Turner]]'s sleepover.
