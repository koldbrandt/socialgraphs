'''Wilson Aubry''' is a first-grader at [[South Park Elementary]] who appears in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Franchise Prequel]]". The [[Coon and Friends]] visit him to help him, but he turns them down, believing that they did all the horrible things [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] said they did on [[Facebook]].

==Appearance==
Wilson is a chubby first-grader with brown hair styled into an undercut and freckles. He wears a sports jersey, army pants, and white socks.

==Personality==
Wilson, like the rest of the town, blindly accepted Professor Chaos' Facebook posts as real 'news', implying he doesn't have much of a mind of his own, which [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] accuses him of. He was dismissive when The Coon tried to tell him the posts were fake, instead screaming and slamming the door in his face.
