{{LinkDisambig|Sarah (Disambiguation)}}
'''Sarah Valmer''' is [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s mother and [[Ryan Valmer]]'s wife. She first appears in "[[Krazy Kripples]]", suspecting Jimmy has joined a gang.

==Background==
In "[[Fishsticks]]", she offers Jimmy and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] fruits and vegetables for a snack to replace Cartman's chips, before saving Jimmy from a black widow spider. Cartman would later misremember both events, with himself killing the spider, and Sarah bringing them chips and telling him he's "handsome and not even remotely fat".

==Appearance==
Sarah wears a white shirt with a noticeable amount of cleavage, underneath is an orange sleeveless dress, with a white belt around her waist. Her hair is almost wavy, long and black, and like most of the moms in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], she wears red lipstick. Her breasts seem to be quite large and full-shaped, this being different from most of the South Park women, who are often portrayed as flat until they take off their shirt.

==Personality==
Little is known about her personality, but she apparently can get very emotional, as in [[Krazy Kripples]], when she and Ryan try to get Jimmy out of the gang he's joined, but when he refuses, she bursts into tears.
