'''Cthulhu''' is a Great Old One (gods of inter-dimensional origins), originally created by author H.P. Lovecraft in his story, ''The Call of Cthulhu'''''. '''He makes his first appearance in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" and subsequently appears in "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]". He enters the human realm and causes mass destruction. He also teams up with Cartman and is revealed to be the reason for Kenny's immortality.

==Background==
In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", when DP (formerly BP) drill a hole in the Gulf and accidentally reaches another dimension, they attempt to rectify the problem by drilling on the moon to change its gravitational pull on the Earth, hoping that this will solve the problem. However, all this does is make the problem a whole lot worse when it releases Cthulhu, a very large green tentacle headed monster with glowing orange eyes, massive wings, and long spindly arms, from his interdimensional slumber. A news reporter explains Cthulhu is expected to reign over the Earth in a dark period of around 3000 years, during which he would drive the world to madness and enslave humanity as members of his cults.

As he continues his rampaging in "[[Mysterion Rises]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] (dressed as the [[The Coon (Character)|Coon]]) approaches the monster in New Orleans where he attempts to sway Cthulhu to be his ally and help him destroy his friends and former teammates, the [[Coon and Friends]]. Although Cthulhu takes enough time to listen (or at least observe) Cartman's rantings, he grows bored and attempts to leave, at which point Cartman manipulates Cthulhu by behaving overly cute. As a result, Cthulhu grows fond of him and proceeds to do Cartman's bidding. Cartman and Cthulhu proceed to rampage across the world, attacking all the things that Cartman alone deems evil (The Jewish People, San Francisco, Whole Foods, and Hippies).

Their next act of course involves Cartman ordering Cthulhu to send Coon and Friends to dark oblivion. With his friends gone, in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" Cartman and Cthulhu continued cutting a path of destruction, massacring [[Justin Bieber]] and his fans, until they are defeated by [[Bradley Biggle|Mint-Berry Crunch]], who had discovered his alien powers, and Cthulhu is sent back to its world, along with his deity armies, and the holes in the Gulf of Mexico are filled.

==Appearance==
Cthulhu is a gigantic, inter-dimensional deity, miles high. He is shown towering over a DP (formerly BP) drilling platform. He has two long, massive arms with sharp talons. He has two large bat-like wings on his back. He also has two clawed back legs. He has a long tail, which seems to be used to direct himself through the air. His head has two massive yellow eyes, similar to that of a dinosaur's. Instead of a mouth, he has a large set of tentacles that move whenever he "talks", or makes vocal sounds. Though his appearance alone can drive people insane, this is apparently not the case with everyone in the ''South Park'' universe, who react normally to his presence.

==Powers and Abilities==
[[File:MysterionRises64.png|thumb|Cthulhu using his powers.]]
As shown when he attacks the Gulf of Mexico, Cthulhu is truly a god and is possibly the most powerful being in existence (or the most powerful creature ever shown in South Park), although he is still defeated by Mint-Berry Crunch. His powers include, but are not limited to:
*'''Godlike Strength:''' Cthulhu has enough strength to easily rip a massive Ferris wheel off of its hinges, as though it were made of paper, and hurls down upon unlucky humans. He also kills Justin Bieber by crushing his head between the index finger and the thumb.
*'''Lightning Touch:''' Cthulhu can release lightning from his hands, which can completely incinerate a person in seconds.
*'''Dimensional Travel:''' Cthulhu is shown to be able to make an enemy be sent to R'lyeh, the supernatural capital of his empire, by a wave of his hand.
*'''Flight:''' Due to his massive wings, Cthulhu can fly across long distances, such as the distance between the Moon and the Gulf of Mexico, in seconds.
*'''Storm creation: '''Whenever Cthulhu is present, massive thunderstorms darken the sky.
*'''Immortality:''' In the original story "Call of Cthulhu" by H.P. Lovecraft, and "Trail of Cthulhu" by August Derleth, Cthulhu would regenerate from any wound, up to and including a nuclear bomb. This is supported in the show when [[Mysterion]] mentions Cthulhu being an immortal, and that only an immortal can kill another immortal. He also demonstrates the ability to survive in the vacuum of space.

==Trivia==
[[File:cth3.jpg|thumb|H.P. Lovecraft, the creator of Cthulhu.]]
*Cthulhu was first described in twentieth-century author H.P. Lovecraft's work "The Call of Cthulhu", first published in the ''Weird Tales'' magazine in the late 1920s. It is one of Lovecraft's most well-known stories and spawned what is known as the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe upon which many subsequent writers have based their work.
*Many references to the Cthulhu Mythos are made throughout the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superheroes Arc]], including the depiction of the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', a fictional book from the Mythos, as well as the emergence of creatures resembling the extraterrestrial Mi-Go and other creatures described in Lovecraft's work.
*Several scenes involving Cthulhu and The Coon are parodies of scenes from the 1988 film, ''My Neighbor Totoro''.
*Cthulhu is one of two Lovecraftian deities to appear in South Park, the other is his grandmother [[Shub-Niggurath]]
*H.P. Lovecraft was a fanatic for Greek mythology, that came as an inspiration for the creation of Cthulhu.
