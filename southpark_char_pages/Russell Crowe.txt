'''Russell Crowe''' is a New Zealand-Australian actor, who appears in a poster in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", and later in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]".

==Background==
The episode centers around the boys, who are trying to see the new trailer to [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s second ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' film. The trailer is set to appear during a commercial break on Crowe's TV show, ''[[Russell Crowe Fightin' Around The World]]'' which depicts Crowe traveling the world, with his tugboat [[Tugger]], randomly beating people up. Crowe also appears in "[[The Gauntlet]]", a parody created for the MTV Movie Awards. He is in the role of Maximus Decimus Meridius but referred to as Russell Crowe. He also reappears in the episode "[[200]]" within the group of celebrities that the show has mocked in previous seasons. He picks up a fight with [[Buddha]] in the following episode "[[201]]".

==Appearance==
Russell Crowe was shown with long combed brown hair, a brown beard, and some warts on his face. He was seen wearing a black shirt under a dark blue sailor uniform, gray pants, and black shoes. He also wears a white sailor cap with a black border.

==Personality==
He appears to be extremely insecure in his television show, beating people up without provocation. He also seems to take anything that is not praised as an insult.

==Trivia==
*On an episode of ''60 Minutes'', "60 Minutes Crowe", Crowe said the following in response to his appearance on ''South Park'': ''"I think they are very, very funny men, and I wish them godspeed, and I hope they continue to do what they’re doing. For me, if there was something for me to learn from it, it is the analogous thing because I did think the whole thing was a fight, I did think my whole career was a struggle. I was born in Seatoun, New Zealand, in Wellington, and we're talking up here in a hotel in New York. That's a long way."''

==Prominence==
