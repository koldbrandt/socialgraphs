'''Saint Peter''' (born as: '''Shimon Bar-Yona''' in Bethsaida, Judea) is a Christian saint and a disciple of [[Jesus Christ]].

==Biography==

During the Last Supper, Jesus selected the white rabbit to be the first Pope as he knew no man can speak for God without becoming corrupt while rabbits are pure. But as the years went by, the Catholic Church deemed the idea of a rabbit running for Pope to be a form of sacrilege so they portrayed Saint Peter as a man and buried the truth.

Saint Peter whose true form is that of a rabbit is the secret leader of [[Hare Club for Men]] and a rival of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] as seen in "[[Fantastic Easter Special]]".

Saint Peter is also mentioned in the song "[[Sixteen Tons]]".
