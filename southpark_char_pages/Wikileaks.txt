'''Wikileaks''' was a rat who appeared in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[Bass to Mouth]]". 

==Appearance==
Wikileaks appears as a regular rat with dark gray fur and a blond head of hair.

==Personality==
In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", he enjoyed posting the [[South Park Elementary]] students' gossips and secrets on [[Eavesdropper]], even though any potential self-benefit is outweighed by the cost of running and maintaining a website. He is also the older brother of [[Lemmiwinks]]. Wikileaks was shown to be intelligent enough to operate a computer, and record things with a helmet cam.

==Trivia==
*Wikileaks' name and character is a reference to Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks, on which leaked government documents are posted and made available for download. The character's hair also resembles Assange's.
*Wikileaks is also used to reference the rat and villain "Martin" from ''The Secret of NIMH 2''.
