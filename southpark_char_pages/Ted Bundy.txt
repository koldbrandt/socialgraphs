'''Theodore Robert "Ted" Bundy''' was an American serial killer. He made an appearance in the episode "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", as a resident of [[Hell]].

==Background==
In "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", he is said by a demon to have be one of Hell's most evil souls. He was given the task of picking up [[Satan]]'s Ferrari cake, along with [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[John Wayne Gacy]], but the trio fell into a comedy of Three Stooges-esque antics, with Bundy playing the role of Moe. He is depicted as the most mentally stable of the trio and slaps around the other two when they kill people.

Later, when the cake is destroyed and they have to make a new one, they get into a fight. During the fight, he tears out Gacy's eyes with his fingers and cuts off Dahmer's tongue. He is then stabbed in the ribs then through the roof of his mouth by Dahmer, killing him.

==Appearance==
Ted appears in an olive-colored jacket, a black shirt, and brown pants.
