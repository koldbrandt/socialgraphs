In [[A Touch of Faith]] mission, [[Father Maxi]] sends the New Kid into a room at the back end of [[South Park Church]]. The New Kid enters the room while it was dark, before being approached by the pedophile priests doing, questionable things. As the lights were turned on, the New Kid fights off and defeats the priests. Later, Father Maxi opens the room and was shocked by their presence, chasing them away and telling them they will go to Hell for their actions. Father McManus retorted, claiming this was not what the [[Queen Spider]] says, with Father Hansley calling out "ten Male Hairies".
