'''Anthony Webster''', who referred to himself online as '''MLKKK''', was an internet troll who first appeared in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Wieners Out]]".

==Background==
Anthony Webster was an internet troll from the city of [[Fort Collins (City)|Fort Collins]], Colorado who was infamous for mocking people online.

In "[[Wieners Out]]", Webster is seen briefly at a once undisclosed location. [[Dildo Shwaggins]] convinces [[Gerald Broflovski]] to join their team of trolls to help the cause against [[TrollTrace.com]].

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", he attends the secret troll conference held in the [[Airport Hilton]] hotel. After Shwaggins and Gerald coordinate the troll, Webster joins the troll as MLKKK.

In "[[Fort Collins]]", [[Lennart Bedrager]] and [[TrollTrace.com]] are able to successfully identify Webster as an internet troll, and publicly reveal  the internet histories of everyone in Fort Collins, including Webster's. Fleeing unsuccessfully, he is confronted by [[Father and Handicapped Daughter|an angry father of a disabled girl]]. The father, in retaliation for Webster calling his daughter "R2-D2", throws a bucket of gasoline on Webster and lights it, burning him alive.

===Office===
Webster's computer is located in his living room. To his left is his television, gaming consoles, and blu-ray discs. He also has a large cabinet displaying action figures from various pop culture franchises, such as The Matrix, Batman, Power Rangers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Flash.

In front of him are a stack of discs, a globe, and several action figures, including Optimus Prime. Behind him, on his left, is a ficus tree similar to those featured in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]".

He uses an iPhone, and has a chair with an arm attached, giving him the ability to eat a snack without using his hands.

==Appearance==
Anthony Webster is a young African-American man with longish black hair and buck teeth. His eyes are farther apart than regular South Park characters, giving him an awkward look. He is quiet and soft-spoken, and slightly overweight. He wears a checkered yellow collared shirt with a light blue bowtie, dark gray pants with a black belt, white shoes, a black watch, and carries a blue backpack.
