'''Lil 'Sheep''' was a member of [[The Orange County Crew|Orange County Crew]] who appeared in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[You Got F'd in the A]]". He is probably the leader of the group.

==Background ==
Lil 'Sheep and the other OC kids challenged the boys to dance in the True-Value parking lot. Not knowing what was going on, the boys were "served" by OC Crew. Later when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] met the OC team again, Stan "served" them back by dancing to Billy Ray Cyrus's "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]". Lil 'Sheep demanded that they challenge them at OC Convention Center for a chance to participate in a music video with [[Lil' Kim]].

At the end of the episode when Stan had no chance of winning the OC dance competition, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] appears to dance along with the [[The South Park Diggities|South Park Diggities]]. When Butters began his tap dance routine, his shoe flew, knocking the stage lights over Lil 'Sheep and the rest of the OC kids, killing them all. Everyone applauded Butters, but he was upset about the tragedy that happened the second time.

==Appearance==
Lil 'Sheep wears a black shirt, gray pants with black stripes and black shoes. He has black hair with braids and was seen wearing a gray cap with his name written in white, which on the original airing of the episode read "Lil Shiit" instead of "Lil Sheep".
