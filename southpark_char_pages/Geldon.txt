Geldon is a large purple and black dragon with a wide wingspan. He has green on his face and he has two horns on his head. He is mostly black with a purple underside, purple wings, and purple on the tip of his tail. Unlike other monsters, Geldon has a light nasal voice instead of a loud and deep one.
