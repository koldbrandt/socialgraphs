'''Cliff Barackman''' is a recurring [[City People|citizen]] of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He is based upon "Finding Bigfoot"'s real person with this name,<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Bigfoot "Finding Bigfoot"] on Wikipedia.</ref> and was first seen in "[[Jewpacabra]]" as part of the [[Bigfoot Researchers]] of town. In his debut he was voiced by [[Trey Parker]], in his next appearance he was briefly voiced in a grunt by [[Matt Stone]] in the end of "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]".

==Appearance==
He is a Caucasian male who has a widow's peak and a thin mustache, who sports a long goatee. While in his debut, he does not wear a hat. In his later appearances he is shown wearing a dark blue cap, alongside his usual attire consisted of a white shirt under a dark blue coat, light beige pleated trousers, and brown boots with light grey cover to the toes.

He bears much resemblance to [[James Cameron]]'s design.
