The '''Meth Heads''' were a group of drug dealers who appeared in [[Season Seven]] episode "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".

==Background==
[[The Boys]] were assigned a detective case to deal with a meth lab. As they reach the location of the meth lab, the dealers armed themselves with weapons and started firing. However, one of them lost control of his gun, sending a bullet into flammable liquids and subsequently burning another meth head. Two other meth heads tried escaping in a getaway truck, only to be ran over by another truck and burning them as well. The remaining meth head was seen flying a small aircraft, but realized that it ran out of fuel, before crashing into South Park's [[Post Office]].
