'''Taylor Alison Swift''' is an American Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and occasional actress. She was featured in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]".

==Background==
Taylor Swift is one of the guest stars on the ''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]''. She is first seen in the trailer for the special, where she sits with [[Bill Cosby]], declining a drink. Swift and Cosby perform a duet, "''[[Baby It's Cold Outside]]"'' in its traditional way (one of the performers trying to seduce the other), for the special. Taylor acts out her role, trying to decline Cosby. The act is later disturbed by the appearance of the YouTuber, [[PewDiePie]]. The sound of the performance is muted, while [[Eric Cartman]] and PewDiePie argue. The show still continues in the background, escalating to Cosby getting Swift to drink and him approaching her, rubbing her cheek. PewDiePie then takes control of the show and instead of the special, it now shows the gameplay of the video game: ''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''.

== Appearance ==
Like the real Taylor, the character is a young blonde-haired woman, with red lipstick and blush. She wears a purple v-neck short-armed shirt and a brown long skirt. Her dangle earrings are dark blue and yellow/gold. She is later seen wearing a brown jacket on top of her attire. Her outfit is based on Esther Williams' appearance when she performs ''Baby, it's Cold Outside'' with Ricardo Montalbán in the film ''Neptune's Daughter''.
