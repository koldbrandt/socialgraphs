The '''Anti-Christ''' is the [[Woodland Critters]]' savior, much like how [[Jesus Christ]] is the savior for Christians. It appeared in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]".

==Background==
The Anti-Christ comes into the world after Porcupiney gets pregnant after having sex with [[Satan]]. The critters get [[Stan Marsh]] to kill the mountain lion and build them a manger for the birth by using their superficial innocence. [[Kyle Broflovski]] is chosen to be the host for the Anti-Christ since he's Jewish and has never been baptized. The Anti-Christ enters inside him, but it's not long before Kyle wants him out. Using their abortion techniques learned in the abortion clinic, the [[Mountain Lion Cubs|mountain lion cubs]] remove the Anti-Christ through Kyle's anus. [[Santa Claus]] then proceeds to smash the Anti-Christ with a sledgehammer. This creature likely doesn't exist, as it was only seen in [[Eric Cartman]]'s story.

==Appearance==
The Anti-Christ is a small, mostly hairless creature resembling a mixture of a porcupine and a human fetus. It has beady red eyes, a human nose, jagged teeth, and two white horns.

==Powers and Abilities==
In "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]", it was shown to be able to transform into some type of yellow substance and absorb into whoever offered themselves to it. However, the Anti-Christ seems to materialize inside the host's body, as it was able to be removed from Kyle's anus by the mountain lion cubs, fully intact.
