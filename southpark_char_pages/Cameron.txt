'''Cameron''' has different roles during the show, he was seen as a Toss-A-Ball operator in "[[Cow Days]]", and appears to be one of [[Jimbo]]'s friends in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]".

==Background==
In "[[Cow Days]]" Cameron runs a booth for pitchin 'games. He used fake [[Terrance and Phillip]] dolls to lure the boys (five dollars three times) and stole their money. Finally, he was arrested by [[Officer Barbrady]] for stealing their money.

His first scene in the episode "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" is in a conversation with [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]], [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and other adults about who would be the team that would win at AFC. Randy asks if watching another guy masturbate is gay, saying that a friend of his has already done so. Cameron then suggests kicking his ass, but is upset to learn that Randy's "friend" is living in Florida. At the end of the episode, when all the guests at the party discover that Randy and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] watched each other masturbate, Jimbo reveals that he and Cameron have done it too.

==Appearance==
Cameron is a tall, burly man with black hair on top of his head (presumably from balding) who wears a simple white shirt with short sleeves and a round neck, blue jeans and black shoes. In "Cow Days" he wore a gray shirt under a blue jumpsuit.
