'''The 6th Grader with Cyan Hat''' is a student in [[South Park Elementary]] who is generally seen as a background character. He was first seen in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Clubhouses]]". He is the possible older brother of [[Sally Bands]].

==Background==
His first major appearance was in "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]" where he, along with the [[6th Grader Leader]] and another [[6th Grader with Brown Hat|unnamed 6th grader]], frighten [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] with the ghost legends, making [[The Boys|the boys]] want revenge.

In "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]", he along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] want to get a [[Back Door Sluts 9|porn film]] that was with the boys. This is the first time we can hear him talking.

His last featured appearance was in "[[Pre-School]]" where he and the other 6th graders promise the boys to protect them from [[Trent Boyett]], but in the end, all fail.

==Personality==
Despite being one of the three main 6th graders, not much is known about his personality. He was shown to behave the same way as most other 6th graders, like enjoying bullying younger children. Like the other 6th graders, he stopped being a bully in recent episodes, as seen in "[[Butterballs]]" where he participates in Stan's anti-bullying video.

==Appearance==
He wears a long-sleeved blue T-shirt, a green collar, a cyan hat that is similar to Stan's but without the puffball, matching dark blue pants and gloves and black shoes. He has black hair and black thick eyebrows.
