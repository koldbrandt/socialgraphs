'''Marcus''' is a man who dated [[Ms. Crabtree]] in [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s dream in the [[Season Two]] episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]".

==Background==
Marcus is a truck driver for [[Red's Roofies]]. He picks up Ms. Crabtree when she goes off to get help for the stranded [[School Bus|school bus]]. He was attracted to Ms. Crabtree. He attempts to give her "roofies" but they have no effect on her. Aiming to assist her in finding help for the kids, Marcus instead gets caught up in her newfound fame as a comedian. He accompanies Crabtree first to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and then to ''[[Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]].'' Afterwards, the two fall in love, although Marcus warns Mrs. Crabtree that he cannot "stay" due to the events all being [[Stan Marsh|a third grader]]'s dream.

==Appearance==
He has short black hair. He wears a blue "dress" shirt, dark gray pants, and a gray-buckled black belt.

==Personality==
He seems to be willing to "date rape" a woman, as he gave Mrs. Crabtree "roofies", a common "date rape" drug. Later in the episode, he seemed to be kind, later falling in love with Mrs. Crabtree and treating her with the utmost respect. He is possibly an allusion to [[Elvis Presley]].
