'''Kim Jong-il''' was the leader of [[North Korea]] from 1994 to 2011. He appeared in "[[Krazy Kripples]]" as a member of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s [[Legion of Doom]].

==Appearance==
Kim has the stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes. He also has various facial wrinkles, an abnormally large nose, thin, black eyebrows, and thick, peach-colored lips. He wears a green, presumably button-up shirt.

==Personality==
Kim does not have a major role in "[[Krazy Kripples]]", so little is known about his personality, however, it can be assumed he has a lust for power and is ill-intentioned, as he joined [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Legion of Doom, a short-lived supervillain organization.

==Trivia==
*In ''Team America: World Police'', which was also created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], Kim Jong-il speaks in a very similar voice to [[Tuong Lu Kim]]. He is the main antagonist in that film, and his personality is likened to that of [[Eric Cartman]].
