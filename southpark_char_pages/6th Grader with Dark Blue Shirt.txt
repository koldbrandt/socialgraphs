The '''6th Grader with Dark Blue Shirt''' is a [[South Park Elementary]] student who first appeared in [[Season Eight]]  episode, "[[Pre-School]]". He is usually used as a background character.

==Background==
For now, the only episode in which he has a speaking role is in "[[Pre-School]]". In this episode he along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] promise to defend [[The Boys]] from [[Trent Boyett]] in exchange for a picture of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s boobs. After the boys gave the picture (which was actually a picture of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ass), the 6th graders try to fight Trent but fail.

==Personality==
Not much is known about his personality. We can assume that he behaves the same as the other 6th graders, like spending time bullying children younger than him.

==Appearance==
He has curly brown hair and wears a dark blue shirt with orange collar, light brown pants and black shoes.
