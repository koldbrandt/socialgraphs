The '''Chinese Court Judges''' are a trio of high-ranking Chinese officials who came to judge [[Randy Marsh]]'s crime of illegal possession of marijuana into [[China]]. They appear in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, "[[Band in China]]". They reappeared in [[Season Twenty-Four]]'s episode, "[[The Pandemic Special]]".

==Background==
When Randy is arrested by the Chinese police for illegal possession of marijuana, he is brought into the Chinese Court where he meets the judges. They have just sentenced a prisoner to another 10 years in prison for disgracing the country. Randy successfully persuades the judges to put him on parole.

In "[[The Pandemic Special]]", they reappeared as a flashback of what Randy and [[Mickey Mouse]] did in China in "[[Band in China]]", with some previously unrevealed details on what they did there.
