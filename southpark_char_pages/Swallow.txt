'''Swallow''' is a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]] as well as [[Seaman]]'s bird sidekick who first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Super Best Friends]]".

==Background==
In all of Swallow's appearances, it is shown perching on top of Seaman's shoulder. Though it does not play a very large role in any of its appearances, Seaman can be heard talking to it a few times. In "[[201]]", when [[Jesus Christ]] tells Seaman and Swallow to go get some sushi for dinner, he leaves and says "Swallow, come!" causing the other Super Best Friends to burst out laughing due to the dirty-sounding line.

Like Seaman, Swallow appears to be capable of breathing underwater without drowning.

==Appearance==
Swallow has white and gray feathers as well as small black claws. It wears a teal bandana around its eyes.
