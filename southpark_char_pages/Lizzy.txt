'''Lizzy''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female 4th grader]], who makes her first appearance in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" as a background character.

==Background==
Lizzy plays a more prominent role in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" when she challenges [[the boys]] to a sledding competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/404576|title=FAQ - South Park Studios|publisher=southparkstudios.com}}</ref> Despite her apparent death at the end of the same episode, she made numerous cameos in the background until the twelfth season.

==Appearance==
Lizzy wears a rose pink parka that covers most of her face, similar to [[Kenny McCormick]]'s parka. However, Lizzy's mouth can be seen. Her parka has gray fleece padding and buttons up. She also wears gray gloves, dark gray pants, and black shoes. To date, her hair has never been shown onscreen.

==Personality==
Lizzy seems to be very stubborn and competitive, as she challenges the boys without hesitation when they do not hand over the sleds, exhibiting confidence in her team's ability to win a sledding competition against them. She enjoys taunting the boys and coming up with creative insults, such as "Butt Pirates", "Rump Rangers" and "Donut Pinchers". She rubs in their faces when they lose [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] as a fellow sledder and reminds them of the upcoming competition, including calling them on a home phone to harass them. Her sexually advanced vocabulary also suggests a vulgar sense of humor uncommon among female characters in the show.

==Interactions==
Lizzy was depicted alongside [[Bebe Stevens]], [[Sally Turner]], and [[Esther]] in her speaking appearance, where the three girls made up the members of her sledding team; they were also seen at her house when she called the boys up to taunt them.

==Trivia==
*Her name is never spoken onscreen; the official script identifies her as "LIZZY, a cute little girl in a pink coat", which has been reinforced at the official website in the FAQ section and on Twitter.<ref>https://twitter.com/southpark/status/351423144650739712</ref>
*Despite the fact she was carried offscreen by a bear at the end of "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", she has been shown in later episodes. It is possible that the bear did not kill her, much like the bear in "[[Jewbilee]]".
*Lizzy wears a parka and has a sexually advanced vocabulary, making her similar to [[Kenny McCormick]].
*In the episode "[[Douche and Turd]]", there is another student identical to Lizzy sitting a few rows behind her in the audience at the school pep rally.
*Since a number of new background fourth graders were created for the second half of the twelfth season, she has not reappeared on the show.
