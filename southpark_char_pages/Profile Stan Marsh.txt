'''Profile Stan Marsh''' was [[Stan Marsh]]'s anthropomorphic [[Facebook]] profile. He was very large in stature and made his only appearance in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]", where he is the main antagonist.

==Background==
He challenged the real Stan Marsh to a game of Yahtzee. Stan won and his Facebook profile was defeated and vanished. Stan was sent back to the real world, now having zero friends because his profile "died". All of his friends were sent to [[Kip Drordy]]'s profile, who had no friends at that time.

==Appearance==
Profile Stan Marsh's appearance was similar to Stan in terms of his body and shape. He was physically taller than Stan, being almost five times his size. Profile Stan Marsh wore a black and red Tron suit which includes gloves, a helmet, shoulder pads, pants, and a shirt.
