'''Brett''' is a clerk who works the front desk of the [[EvGames]] video game store who appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode "[[Guitar Queer-O]]".

==Background==
After [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] play a game of ''[[List of Video Game References|Guitar Hero]]'' together, Stan goes to EvGames to buy some game guides for it. Brett, the clerk who works the front desk of the store, offers Stan a game called ''[[Heroin Hero]]'', which causes Stan to become addicted to the game and unable to play ''Guitar Hero''. After Stan ends up blowing his chance of breaking one million points in ''Guitar Hero'', he goes back to the store. Brett offers him ''Rehab Hero'', but Stan tells him that he just wants a simple driving game and Brett sells him ''Cross Country Cruiser''.
