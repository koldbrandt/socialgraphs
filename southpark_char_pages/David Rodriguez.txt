*In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", a citizen reveals David's surname to be Rodriguez.
**However, on the official ''South Park'' Twitter, it was revealed that, in the original script for "[[You're Not Yelping]]", his last name was "Teelez".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/657007097335275521|title=It's not mentioned in the show, but according to the script the new family's last name is "Teelez". #BehindTheScenes #SouthPark|publisher=South Park Twitter}}</ref>
*He is the fifth non-white character to become a student at [[South Park Elementary]], behind [[Kevin Stoley]], [[Token Black]], [[Michael]], and [[Nichole Daniels]].
*David's character design was taken from a background character seen in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", when the kids were hitting the piñata. Additionally, a background character with the same design was seen in "[[Stunning and Brave]]" when the [[Syrian refugee children]] storm the [[PC Delta|PC Frat House]].
