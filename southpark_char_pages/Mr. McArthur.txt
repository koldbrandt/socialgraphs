'''Mr. McArthur''' is [[Red McArthur]]'s father. He makes his first appearance in [[Season Twelve]]'s "[[The China Probrem]]".

==Background==
He first appears as a background character who makes several cameos, starting with "[[The China Probrem]]" when he appears in [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s nightmare. He is one of many in a line seen watching [[Tiger Woods]] play golf in "[[Sexual Healing]]". In "[[The Problem with a Poo]]", he appears in this episode at a [[City Council]] meeting where the council decides to cut the budget of [[Mr. Hankey]]'s Christmas pageant by half.

"[[Christmas Snow]]" marks the first time Mr. McArthur speaks. He tells [[Santa Claus|Santa]] that they are trying to have fun when he talks about the dangers of drunk driving at the tree lighting ceremony.

He is revealed to be Red's father "[[The Pandemic Special]]". While the students are quarantined in [[South Park Elementary|school]] for two weeks, they are only given five minutes to have Zoom calls with their parents in the computer lab. Red is seen on a call with her parents. Mr. McArthur tells her that they miss her and cannot wait for quarantine to be over.

Only [[Moira McArthur|his wife]] attends the parent-teacher Zoom call with [[Mr. Mackey]] earlier in the episode.

==Appearance==
Mr. McArthur has dark brown hair. He wears a brown v-neck pullover with a light brown neckline, under which he wears a brown collared shirt. He wears dark gray pants with a black belt and black shoes.
