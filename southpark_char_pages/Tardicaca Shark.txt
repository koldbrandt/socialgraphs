The '''Tardicaca Shark''', is a fictional fresh water shark species, which is found in [[Lake Tardicaca]]. The Tardicaca Shark appears in the episode "[[Crippled Summer]]", where it was seen having intercourse with [[Nathan]] twice. The incident is frequently brought up by [[Mimsy]], much to Nathan's fury.

==Background==
In "[[Crippled Summer]]", Nathan devices a plan to get rid of [[Jimmy Valmer]] from the summer camp, with the use of a shark whistle to summon the shark. He instructs Mimsy to swim under the lake, then blow the whistle. Mimsy, however, took the instructions literally, blowing the whistle ''after'' swimming on the lake. The shark responds to the whistle and attempts intercourse on Nathan. Towards the end of the episode, when Nathan's final plan on Jimmy backfired, the shark returned once more.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' DLC [[Bring the Crunch]], the shark serves as a possible prey in fishing, and a requirement for a badge.

==Appearance==
The shark's shape and size appears is similar to a Great White shark. They share the same shaped fins and head, as well as teeth and eyes. However, it has brown/green skin and nasial barbels similar to those of a catfish. It purportedly has a 9-inch penis, much to Nathan's chagrin.

==Trivia==
When [[The New Kid]] successfully catch the shark, Nathan will urge the New Kid to destroy the shark for him. It seems that Nathan can never forget about the shark.
