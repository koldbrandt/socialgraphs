'''Leopold "Butters" Stotch''' is a major character in the series.  He is a fourth-grader in [[South Park Elementary]]. Butters' role gradually began to increase after he replaced [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] during his temporary removal in [[Season Six]]. This allowed Butters to gain more screen time and further develop his character. He is the "innocent child" in the group and Cartman's most exploited and possibly best "friend". Butters is loosely based on [[Eric Stough]], an animation director/producer that works on the show.

==Background==
Butters has made appearances since "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", though initially as a background character. He gets his first speaking role in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]", and he receives another speaking role in the following episode. He later receives a speaking role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

Butters was seen sporadically in seasons three through five, going from a social pariah in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" to mean-spirited bully in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]".

In "[[Jared Has Aides]]", Butters was adopted by Stan Marsh, [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Eric Cartman]] as their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died "permanently" at the end of the [[Season Five|fifth season]]. The writers had given Butters his own spotlight episode as the season five finale to prepare fans for Butters taking Kenny's place on the show. The episode, titled "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]", gave Butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and his mother attempted to drown her son Butters in a fit of madness. They all made up at the end of the episode and nothing came of it.

Butters found himself as the new fourth friend, being put down and treated like a total outcast by his new friends. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman all openly bullied Butters, telling him how he is not cool like Kenny. Cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making Butters suffer, to the extent that, in "[[Jared Has Aides]]", he pretended to be Butters on the phone and bad-mouthed his parents, just so he could watch them abusing him. Several instances show the boys having Butters dress up as Kenny or simply call him Kenny or Not-Kenny, possibly to cope with their loss.

Butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more episodes; two of the episodes continued the plot of Butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of "[[Freak Strike]]", ending the episode just as Butters was about to be beaten (with Cartman being beaten up instead). Ultimately, in the sixth episode of season six, "[[Professor Chaos]]", Butters is expelled from the group for being "too lame" and adopts his super-villain alter ego "[[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]" as a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him. Butters would run around for several episodes as Professor Chaos, only to have no one care much about his plots since many of them had, though Butters did not realize it, already occurred on episodes of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of Professor Chaos to Stan, although he mistook it for Butters coming out of the closet.

Though not anymore a member of the main four's group, Butters was nevertheless kept as a prominent member of the boys' extended circle. Though he has returned, Kenny's role has declined to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and Butters has taken on a more prominent role again. Despite their ill-treatment toward him, Butters stays loyal to his friends, perhaps in hopes that they will accept him. In a way, this has worked as recently there seems to have been some shift in the balance of friendship. The most obvious case of this being in "[[Tsst]]", where Butters is calmly playing along with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, with Cartman being much more alienated than usual, as well as in "[[Casa Bonita]]", where Kyle decides to take Butters with him on his birthday to Casa Bonita instead of Cartman, implying he likes Butters more than Cartman. It has been said that Kyle despises Cartman because of his cruel, sadistic and selfish attitudes, as well as his prejudice—especially towards the Jews.

Despite their history, Butters has recently taken on the role as Cartman's sidekick. Cartman often takes advantage of Butters' kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his schemes. Cartman hurts and betrays Butters quite often, however, Butters continues to trust him unconditionally. Despite this, Butters got even in "[[AWESOM-O]]", where he filmed Cartman dancing, dressed up as [[Britney Spears]], later showing it to [[South Park Elementary]]'s various students and faculty.

Butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of [[Mexico]]. In "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", Butters accidentally strays from Cartman's house and almost gets run over by a car. He is then "refuged" in a house by a couple who thinks that Butters is a Mexican and is given the name "Mantequilla", which is Spanish for Butter. They make him into their personal slave and then dump him into an El Pollo Loco restaurant. Butters then goes with some Mexicans and crosses into Mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the Mexicans. Butters realizes his popularity in Mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of Mexicans. He realizes that every time he raises his arms, the Mexicans cheer with joy. Butters is then made a fugitive by Cartman but the [[U.S. Border Patrol|U.S Border Patrol]] lets Butters back in and win the game of [[Texans vs. Mexicans]]. He is allowed back into the [[United States|U.S]] and shows his popularity to the other boys. In addition, he did not get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more than 2 weeks.

===Name===
Butters was initially referred to in scripts and storyboards as "Puff Puff" and "Swanson" - [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] refers to him by the latter name in the opening scene of the Season Two episode, "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]". Butters was renamed and properly introduced in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]", alongside [[Dougie]]. His nickname is based on that of ''South Park'' animation director [[Eric Stough]]'s.

===Voice===
[[Matt Stone]] has voiced the character ever since his speaking debut in "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]". When Butters spoke in the early episodes, however, his voice was dramatically different from the stuttering Southern accent he has now. His voice then changed to how it sounds today in the season three episode "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]".

===Criminal Record===
Despite being sweet and naïve, Butters does have a criminal record. Most of his crimes and misdeeds were, however, due to Cartman's manipulation and therefore most of these crimes should be branded as "unintentional" or "crime due to manipulation". For the other crimes that were not under Cartman's manipulation, it is caused by Butters' naivety. However, as his alter-ego "Professor Chaos", he will attempt to commit crimes, however his antics are not taken seriously and his plans usually fail miserably. The crimes Butters committed are included but not limited to:

*'''Fraud:''' In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", he took credit for ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]'', in reality [[The Boys|the boys]] wrote it. This may not be entirely Butters' fault though, as [[The Boys|the boys]] originally told him he wrote the book. He may have believed they were trying to mooch off of his success when they revealed that they had actually written the book.
*'''Pimping:''' Butters paid a stripper in "[[Sexual Healing]]" and started a kissing company in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]" which later had real prostitutes involved. However, these crimes were committed on plain stupidity and were unintentional. It is normal for people to pay strippers and that the purpose for the kissing company Butters made was to have women get paid for kissing men, which is a kids game and is not branded on Butters.
*'''Terrorism:''' As Professor Chaos, he, along with [[General Disarray]] (Dougie) and [[The Coon]] (Cartman), threatened to blow up a hospital if [[Mysterion]] did not unmask himself, albeit it was due to Cartman's manipulation. He joins the anti-[[China]] group with Cartman and holds up a restaurant, which results in him shooting three people in the crotch by accident.
*'''Blackmail''': In "[[AWESOM-O]]" Butters tells his [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000|AWESOM-O robot]] (Cartman) that he caught Cartman dressing up as Britney Spears and then dances with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cardboard standee and videotaped it. He told Cartman that if he bullied, pranked, double crossed, or got Butters grounded once more, then Butters would show the videotape to all of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The motive Butters had for blackmailing Cartman was that Butters wanted revenge on Cartman for everything he did to Butters in the past.
*'''Car theft:''' In "[[Poor and Stupid]]", he helps Cartman steal a [[NASCAR]] and crash it, injuring Cartman and killing 11 others. However this crime was committed on Cartman's manipulation.
*'''Breaking and entering:''' He breaks into Cartman's house to try and bite him, when he thinks he is a vampire. He breaks into [[Jenkins]]'s ranch, with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman, to get the baby cows.
*'''Manslaughter:''' He helps Cartman freeze himself in "[[Go God Go]]" which kills Cartman. However, Cartman comes back in the future and goes back in time so to Butters it technically never happens, so it is not a crime. He accidentally kills a bunch of people on two separate occasions while tap-dancing due to his shoe flying off and causes a chain reaction of events which kill people and lead people to kill themselves, but the second time he does it everyone cheers and congratulates him. As a result of this, this crime is not branded on Butters and his criminal record. In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]" he writes a book called ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]'' which inspires someone to kill the [[Kardashians]] with a shotgun.
*'''Murder:''' In "[[Sexual Healing]]", he and Kyle are ordered by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to shoot at a "[[Wizard Alien|wizard alien]]" who, unbeknown to them, is a soldier dressed up in an alien costume. However, this does not really count as a crime as they were forced by the authorities to kill the soldier and were tricked into thinking he was an alien.
*'''Piracy:''' He joins Cartman's Somalian pirate crew along with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], [[Kevin]], and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] in "[[Fatbeard]]" in which they steal a lot of money and weapons. However, the United States government ignores this crime and blames the Somalian pirates completely.
*'''War crimes:''' In "[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]", he joins Cartman's army of drunken Southerners as a messenger, although he did not ransack, rape, murder, or loot.
*'''Attempted armageddon:''' In "[[Professor Chaos]]", Butters hosted a video and informed the citizens of South Park, that he is going to flood the entire world with a garden hose. However, he only succeeded by flooding his backyard. This was easily foiled and stopped by the Water Department.
*'''Assault with a deadly weapon:''' Shoots a patron of [[P.F. Chang's]] and a police officer in the crotch while holding the patrons hostage with Cartman in "[[The China Probrem]]". They did not get in trouble and walked away after the police were too happy that [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] were convicted of the rape of Indiana Jones.
*'''Sexual assault:''' In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]" he "poked" at [[Paris Hilton]]'s vagina while she was passed out drunk. He did seem to know what he was doing was wrong, as evidenced by his shocked face when his parents walked in; however, he did not seem to realize what he was doing was sexual or illegal.
*'''Indecent exposure:''' In "[[Safe Space]]", Butters ran around the school and into the kindergarten while naked. In "[[Wieners Out]]", he exposes himself at a girls' volleyball game, and then leading the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out movement]], marching through the halls while exposing himself.
*'''False advertising:''' In "[[Sarcastaball]]", Butters distributes his new energy drink during the [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|Sarcastaball]] craze known as [[Butters' Creamy Goo]], which turned out to be his semen. This sports drink then gets distributed to a wider audience, which could cause some serious health problems for some people. However, Butters honestly did not know that he was distributing his own semen.
*'''Arson:''' Although not seen, Butters burns down the school gym in "[[Gluten Free Ebola]]" and as a result gets suspended for it.
*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' Was seen rioting at the Nebraska Mall after finding out the Mr. Hankey was a fake in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]". Participant in South Park Elementary gender war during "[[Proper Condom Use]]".
*'''Sedition:''' In the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|movie]], he was a member of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]], a group with the goal of stopping the execution of [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the government, though he did it to save the world from [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] so that can be justified.
*'''Voter fraud:''' In "[[Obama Wins!]]" Butters is shown to have some involvement in Cartman's conspiracy. After being cornered by Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Craig, Token, Jimmy, and Timmy, he swallows a single almond M&M to prevent him from talking. He is later seen in the emergency room, with his face and cheeks swollen. He does eventually give the information after Kyle threatens to get his father involved. It is later revealed that Cartman realized Butters broke his promise of secrecy; so he visits him in the hospital. He informs Butters that the ballots are safe before feeding him another M&M, worsening his condition.

===Health===
Butters has not shown signs of being very prone to illness (unlike Kyle, for example), but he does have a history of occasional health-related problems on the show.

In "[[AWESOM-O]]", he said that he had a condition that made it hard to control his sphincter, and because of this, he sometimes defecates in his pants and has to wear a diaper to school. Logically, this would be considered Butters' biggest health problem, but it has never been even remotely mentioned anywhere else in the show, except for one scene later on in the same episode. He has also said that he kept his sphincter problem (and the fact that he wears diapers to school) a secret from everyone, except his parents, his doctor(s) and Cartman, who he told without knowing it was him.

In "[[Erection Day]]", Butters is singing his "[[I've Got Some Apples|apple song]]" at the [[South Park Elementary Talent Show]], but when he forgets the words, he becomes very nervous and wets himself before running offstage; his accident is very obvious and visible when it happens. Of course, this would probably mean that his sphincter problem has been cured and he is wearing normal underwear. It is most likely, however, that the writers on the show either forgot about it or decided to ignore it outside of the one [[AWESOM-O|episode]] where it was mentioned.

In "[[Obama Wins!]]", Butters is shown to be severely allergic to almonds. After being cornered by Stan and Kyle, Butters ingests a single almond M&M to prevent him from having to disseminate any information. He is later seen in the hospital swollen, and unable to articulate speech.

===Injuries===
In "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny bought authentic Japanese weapons from a fair. Butters wants to play with them, but they do not allow him. Butters then transforms into Professor Chaos and has a "ninja fight" with the gang. This ends when Kenny accidentally throws a shuriken into Butters' eye, which causes him extreme pain, shocking the other boys. Luckily, Butters receives medical attention after the whole town sees him in shock. In later episodes his eye appears to be fine as if it never happened.

In "[[Pre-School]]", he finds out that a bully from pre-school got out of jail, and then tries to hide. His dad later kicks him out of the house in an effort to make him have fun, but he simply gets nervous and starts singing to himself. The bully arrives and gives him several stereotypical "bully" injuries, including a wedgie so massive it almost killed him, and two severe Indian sunburns.

In "[[The List]]", he hits [[Nelly]] between her legs in order to obtain the list she keeps away from the boys. He apparently gets beaten up for it afterwards, as in the next scene he is seen with a black eye and an arm in a sling.

In "[[The Coon]]" he is punched in the face during his fight with [[Mysterion]] as the Coon intervenes. He leaves the frame with a bloodied nose, also claiming a broken tooth.

In "[[Butterballs]]", he shows up in the cafeteria at lunchtime sporting a black eye. The kids think a school bully is responsible and suggest that he talk to his grandmother about it. However, it is revealed that she is the one who has been inflicting this pain on him.

In "[[Safe Space]]", he is forced to delete any bad comments about people that are posted on social media or get two weeks of detention. Butters eventually goes insane from sleep deprivation and being tormented by [[Reality]] and jumps out of the school window, causing him to have a head brace for the rest of [[Season Nineteen]]. These injuries appear to be gone by "[[Member Berries]]".

===Talents and Interests===
====Intelligence and Memory====
Butters openly joins and helps with some of Cartman's schemes, and is usually shown doing well at it. Butters is often depicted as being innocent, gullible, easily manipulated and stupid.

Butters is shown to be smart in "[[Christian Rock Hard]]" and highly talented, instantly supplying the correct answer to a complicated math problem as well as playing the drums. The context suggests this is a talent of Butters' that is well known to the others. (He also tutors Stan, at his request, in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]" — although it is not clear in which subject, possibly more than one).

However, in "[[Go God Go]]", he did not realize that Cartman may die if frozen in snow for several weeks - he had to get Dougie to inform him of these facts. Although, this may reflect his innocence; Butters may have thought that a person can survive being frozen due to [[Larry ("Prehistoric Ice Man")|Steve]], real name Larry, from "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]" being frozen in ice for thirty-two months and being revived completely healthy; this would give him good reason to believe that Cartman could survive being frozen for three weeks. In "[[Professor Chaos]]", Butters was able to hack into The JumboTron in Coors Field which shows he is proficient in I.T. In "[[Proper Condom Use]]", Butters was shown with good negotiation skills.

====Dance====
As revealed in "[[You Got F'd in the A]]", Butters is a very talented tap dancer, but his fondness for dancing was cut short at the National Tap Dancing Championship when a freak accident (caused by Butters' tap shoe flying off his foot) set off a chain reaction leading to the deaths of eleven people. This has left Butters quite scarred, although this is not immediately apparent. In the same episode he was further terrified as his tap shoe again started another fatal chain of events, leading to the death of [[The Orange County Crew|five rival dancers]] (and their [[The Orange County Crew Coach|instructor]]) who Butters and Stan were set to face in a dance contest.

He also seems to have some break-dancing ability, as seen in "[[Asspen]]". Additionally, Butters exhibits some impressive free-style dancing ability, dancing to [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[Rock Your Body]]" in "[[Marjorine]]". He showed off more dance moves at the end of "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" during Satan's party, imitating [[Michael Jackson]].

====Singing and Music====
Butters is often seen singing to himself, usually "[[I've Got Some Apples]]", a song that goes, "Lu lu lu, I've got some apples / Lu lu lu, you've got some too." He is often cut off at that point. When he does finish, the ending is, "Lu lu lu, let's make some applesauce / Take off our clothes and lu lu lu." or, "Lu lu lu, let's get together / I know what we can do lu lu.", which, either way, could be a strange euphemism for sexual intercourse. In "[[The China Probrem]]" Butters sings, "Lu lu lu I've got some splish splash/ Lu lu lu splish splashing more". Making it seem that his song has changed, but this may be only because he was taking a bath while singing it. In "[[The Losing Edge]]", Butters is in the outfield in baseball and is seen singing a song that goes, "I see a ladybug, hello little ladybug!", he may have been watching a ladybug in the grass while singing. In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", Butters auditions for "[[Fingerbang]]" by singing "[[Little Bunny Foo Foo]]". In "[[AWESOM-O]]" he sings "[[My Robot Friend]]" about his robot friend that resembles the theme song of "The Courtship of 'Eddie's Father", and he seems fond of the Chicago ballad "[[If You Leave Me Now]]". Apparently, Butters can also play the drums quite proficiently; he is seen doing so for Cartman's Christian rock band [[Faith + 1]], featured in "[[Christian Rock Hard]]".

In "[[You Got F'd in the A]]", in the flashback of the horrible accident Butters caused during the championship competition, the song Butters dances to is an upbeat, yet obviously risqué song entitled "[[I've Got Something In My Front Pocket]]", which features the lyrics, "Won't you reach into my pocket and see what it is / Then grab onto it, just for you / Give it a little squeeze and say 'How do you do'."

More recently, in "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", Butters is heard singing a song while using the urinal in the boy's bathroom: "Hey there Mr. Weiner, whaddaya know / Do you need to tinkle tinkle? / Yes, I do think so".

In "[[Canada on Strike]]", Butters preforms "[[What, What In the Butt]]", by Maxwell. The end result is him being called a homo.
In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", Butters sings Joni Mitchell's song "[[Help Me]]" while playing with his army figurines. We hear Butters singing from a tape recorder ''"Happy Trails To You" ''in character as a big Texas singer in "[[The Ungroundable]]". Butters frequently sings the line from Chicago's "[[If You Leave Me Now]]" in "[[Casa Bonita]]".

In "[[World War Zimmerman]]", it is shown he can beatbox quite well.

In "[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]", Butters can be seen listening to a song from the Ring "Jonas Brothers" on MTV.

In "[[Band in China]]", Butters is a guitarist for Stan's band, [[Crimson Dawn]], with the other members being Stan as the lead singer, Kenny as bassist, and Jimmy as drummer.

====Art====
[[File:ItHitstheFan015.png|thumb|Butters standing next to his graffitied name.]]
Butters is extremely adept in art and the show often makes examples of his abilities. In "[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]", Butters makes construction paper versions of the four boys for their animated Christmas short (this may be a reference to South Park's director of animation [[Eric Stough]], whom Butters is loosely based on). Butters also shows his artistic talents in "[[AWESOM-O]]", when he draws a picture of himself and his robot friend. In "[[Kenny Dies]]", he sends a letter to Kenny in the hospital which contains a drawing of them both in an airplane with the words "ME AND MY FRIEND KENNY" written above. As well, in "[[Toilet Paper]]" where the four boys get into trouble by their teacher, Stan claims that, "Art class is for gaywads." Butters then prominently states that he loves art class. Briefly in "[[It Hits the Fan]]" Kyle interrupts Butters tagging a building with his name in the style of a well practiced graffiti artist, which is strange because he could be charged with vandalism; Butters is always seen worrying about following rules. In "Casa Bonita" Butters shows the garbage dump worker a very accurate statue he made of Cartman out of garbage. In "[[Professor Chaos]]", Butters is shown using a sewing machine quite handily to make his cape for his alter ego.
====Sports====
He played with the rest of the boys as the left fielder, on their baseball team in "[[The Losing Edge]]". He was number 99 on the dodgeball team in "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]". He is also seen playing football with the others in "[[Raisins]]". He has been shown several times to be somewhat weak physically, especially in fights. This might impact whatever sport skills he has.
====Writing====
In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", [[the boys]] shift the blame of writing a [[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|vulgar book]] on Butters, in the hopes to avoid punishment for creating something so disgusting. However, when the book becomes a success, Butters takes credit (believing he did create it after having assorted blackouts after reading ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'') and goes on to write a second book entitled ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]''. Butters' style however is much more childish than that of the boys; the extent of his vulgar language involves repeated use of the words "Pee-pee" and "Poop". However, due to people constantly over-analyzing things for what was not really there, the book becomes an instant success, at least until the book supposedly causes a man to kill the [[Kardashians]]. Butters is actually a poor writer or at least a lot worse than Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.
====Languages====
Aside from speaking English, Butters is shown to understand at least one other language. In "[[Fatbeard]]", when Cartman asks residents of [[Somalia]] the location of the pirates, he asks Butters to ask them something, using a book to see how he would say the question in Somalian. When someone replies, Butters, while taking a quick glance at the book, can understand what the man is saying.
====Weaponry====
In "[[The China Probrem]]", Butters was shown wielding an semi-automatic handgun (Glock), given to him by Cartman. Due to the fact Butters was still a kid, his hands flailed wildly, and he was only able to shoot guys in their penis.

==Appearance==
Butters has a small tuft of bright blond hair on the top of his head. He wears a turquoise jacket and dark green pants. For the rest of season 19, Butters wore a neck brace after trying to commit suicide in "[[Safe Space]]".

==Personality==
[[File:Innocent_Butters.png|thumb|Butters in "[[Super Fun Time]]".]]
Butters has a warm personality that everyone finds comforting. Fans consider him one of the sweetest, most innocent, and most gullible characters on the show. He is unique because he has the personality of a child, in contrast to the other more cynical, adult-like kids. He is generally much nicer and much more naive than the four main characters, although he and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] are shown bullying [[Mark Cotswolds]], a home-schooled boy, in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]", while it is worth noting that it was before the major character development of Butters in the show. The kids are often annoyed with Butters because he is not cruel, cold, gross, confident enough "like a normal little boy", as well as the fact that he is a "pussy". He is also vulnerable to being taken advantage of, and the boys often use him for self-defense when they are in very sticky situations, such as in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", when they make Butters go get raped by the [[NAMBLA]] members to save them. However, Butters is saved from getting raped when [[Stuart McCormick]] is confused by the pedophiles as one of the young boys.

Unlike nearly all ''[[South Park]]'' characters, he rarely curses and instead uses euphemisms such as "Aw, hamburgers" or "Son of a biscuit." He has cursed a few times, however, with each instance meant to be very shocking. In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", for example, Butters solemnly says "Fuck you, Eric" to Cartman and farts on his face after his mental breakdown; in "[[Raisins]]", Butters says ''"I'd rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid"'', much to Stan's surprise; and ''"At least we have assholes"'' to [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. He is also noted for swearing a lot more heavily in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]". He has also said ''"You're poor as shit!"'' and ''"That's fuckin' gay!"'' (which he said quite a lot) during "[[Poor and Stupid]]". In the earlier seasons, Butters seemed much more intelligent, and he also seemed to use inappropriate words more often, even saying when the girls challenged them to a sledding race ''"Us men will show those skanky hos who is who!"''

Butters refines himself in self-improvement in almost everything, to perfection, studying regularly and often commenting on how he "needs to learn to behave himself". Other skills include tap dancing but he vowed to not do that talent anymore because he accidentally caused a very horrible tragedy in the tap dancing championships. Unfortunately, he also has extremely low self-esteem and therefore has no judgment as to when or how to use his skills, and perceives everyone around him as knowing much more than he does. Another side effect of this is that he is almost constantly worried about being grounded. Butters is a good student and considered to be a dork by his associates. Butters seems to be constantly seeking a role model, as evidenced when he takes to Cartman (unbeknownst to him) pretending to be a robot in "[[AWESOM-O]]". He constantly struggles to find acceptance among his associates, hence why he often does menial tasks in hopes that this will earn him favor and respect. In the same episode he reveals to Cartman (dressed as AWESOM-O) all of his darkest secrets, including the fact that he suffers from a herniated colon, which means he cannot always control his bowels and requires him to take a suppository through his anus regularly. In "[[Casa Bonita]]", it is revealed that Butters enjoys going to [[Stark's Pond]] and he always hangs out there. In "[[Cartman Sucks]]" Butters is mistakenly accused of being bi-curious, and although he agrees, it is obvious he does not know what this means. Butters also unwittingly gave a very thoughtful speech in the same episode, regarding the treatment of bisexual children. He also admits to be "bike-curious" in "[[The F Word]]".

In "[[Super Fun Time]]", Butters is shown to be more assertive and less willing to go along with Cartman's plans and rule-breaking. In "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", he took the fact that he kissed [[Sally Darson]] as a sign that he was now a man and began thinking on how he needs a job to pay for bills, even though he is only a fourth-grader. In "[[Raisins]]", he is shown to be somewhat wise, in the end when he basically tells Stan "you can't be upset forever". Butters' biggest problem seems to be self-confidence, the will to stand up for himself. He gets taken advantage of by nearly everyone he comes across. In "[[The Ungroundable]]", once he believes he has actually become a vampire, he is not so easily pushed around anymore as he thinks he is immortal. In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", Butters finally stands up for himself by stating to the camp counselors that his confusion is nothing more than a result of the counselors telling several boys, that are assumed to be 'bicurious', that they are confused without explanation. Butters also showed some self-confidence in "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", where he told the [[the boys]] that he would not be tricked, and told them off by saying that they can "suck on his wiener". This outburst stunned the boys, leaving Cartman to ironically call Butters an inconsiderate jerk. Sometimes when Butters is very happy, his smile appears to have risen almost far up to his eyes while the bottom part of his face is almost all skin and nothing more as seen in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", "[[You Have 0 Friends]]", "[[Poor and Stupid]]", "[[T.M.I.]]", and "[[City Sushi]]" (mostly). Although he is ten years old, Butters still pees like a pre-school boy by pulling his pants right down and pulling his shirt up as he stands in front of the urinal. In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", it appears that Butters may have an attraction to fat women, as he fell for one of the Kardashians because she was "so big and squishy". In "[[City Sushi]]", he is mistakenly diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, as he impersonates various characters while playing like many normal kids do.

However, his kind, sweet, and gullible personality disappears in "[[Going Native]]", and is replaced with an upset, pissy, antisocial, and rude persona, as he beats up Scott Malkinson for having such a low self esteem due to the fact he has diabetes, and when his boy classmates attempt to reason with him, Butters immediately lashes out at Kyle, saying he believes he knows everything and acts as though he is an expert at everything, even though he is not, and then rips on Stan, who he says believes the world revolves around himself, and how Stan only cares about self image.  Butters continues to insult his classmates, saying that they are all just as bad, selfish pieces of crap like Cartman, as well as being stuck up, claiming that the only one with any decency is Kenny.  This personality fades away, however, when he has a ceremony at his home land, Hawaii, and then returns to his kind and innocent personality.
===Psychological Trauma===
[[File:Butters_1.png|thumb|left|Butters (presumably) subconscious view of [[Stephen Stotch|his father]].]]
Butters shows obvious signs of mental trauma, most likely due to [[Stephen Stotch|his father]]'s psychologically and physically abusive "parenting". As revealed in "[[Super Best Friends]]", this trauma extends to such an extent that he falls asleep and wakes up to the sound of his own screams. Further evidence of psychological trauma due to his father can be seen in "[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]", where he was told to imagine ''"the most prominent thing in his mind"'', which happened to be his father, screaming that he was grounded; the imaginary version of his father later morphed into a monster-like being.

However, his father is likely not his only source of psychological trauma. Butters' social isolation and constant ridicule at the hands of some of his [[List of Male 4th Graders|classmates]] likely traumatizes him as well. Furthermore, in "[[The Return of Chef]]", Butters was revealed to have been molested by his [[Budd Stotch|uncle]], although he did not seem to realize it was molestation, this is likely another source of trauma. As a result of these events, Butters has very low self-esteem, constantly putting himself down as well believing he is a bad child who deserves punishment. Butters also has a nervous stutter - it is likely this can be attributed to psychological trauma. Though possibly [[Grandma Stotch|Butters' grandma]] was the source of psychological trauma as she was constantly hurting him physically and mentally.

===Professor Chaos===
{{Main|Professor Chaos (Character)|l1=Professor Chaos}}
Butters' alter ego is [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], a supervillain/mad scientist he became when the boys dumped him. He spreads chaos with his sidekick, [[Dougie|General Disarray]], and his hamsters (or "minions"). In "[[The Coon]]", the police and citizens watching his fight against Mysterion seemed aware of his name. The police decided not to even try to shoot him, believing (as a villain) he had unknown superhuman abilities, and the bullets would not affect him and believed he could not die.

In "[[The Coon]]", it was revealed that Professor Chaos uses General Disarray's grandmother's [[U-STOR-IT|public storage]] as his base of operations. There are cardboard computers and a board of possible suspects for [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]] and Mysterion.

In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" it is revealed he was captured by [[Coon and Friends]] and has been held captive in Cartman's basement for several days without food or water. He is still there in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" and later, is joined by the Coon.

In "[[City Sushi]]", as he is burning all of his alter-ego costumes, he attempts to burn his Professor Chaos mask as well, but is abruptly interrupted by [[William Janus|Dr. Janus]]. As a result, his costume remains unharmed.

In "[[Butterballs]]", after a moment of hesitation, Butters decides to confront his [[Grandma Stotch|abusive grandmother]] with his Professor Chaos identity. His plan backfires, as his grandmother who has also adopted a supervillain alter ego easily overpowers him.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Franchise Prequel]]", Professor Chaos creates fake 'news' about the Coon and Friends group by making fake posts about them on Facebook, ruining their reputation and keeping Netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise. He later hires an army of children to aid him, and work as his minions, the [[Chaos Kids]]. The Chaos Kids help Butters create even more fake Facebook posts, using an abandoned warehouse as their secret lair.

====Chaos====
[[File:Professor Chaos.png|thumb|Butters as Professor Chaos]]
Early in his career as [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], Butters was successful at bringing chaos to his fourth grade classroom when he stole the erasers from the chalkboard. During the process of changing into his Professor Chaos costume, Butters was discovered by [[Dougie]], who chose to join him as his sidekick, [[General Disarray]], after being eliminated in the boys' quest to find a new fourth member. Together, Professor Chaos and General Disarray hatched out evil plots that included trying to flood the world with his garden hose and destroying the ozone layer with aerosol spray.

====Plans====
In "[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]", Butters devises a series of supposedly original evil plots, only to abandon each of them after General Disarray informs him that they have already been used on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He nearly goes insane after a while of this, but gets consoled later by the reassurance that this is only because the show has run so long, not his own lack of creativity. This itself was inspired by the real-life frustration that creator's [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] coming up with ideas and plots only to find out the that The Simpsons had already beaten them to the punch. Parker and Stone themselves literally went through every episode to find something that had never been done. And eventually they did: boy bands. They conceived an episode only to find out the ''Simpsons'' did and released such an episode right before theirs was set to air.

==Family==
===[[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] and [[Linda Stotch]]===
Butters is an only child. His parents, [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] (Chris in some appearances) and [[Linda Stotch]], are very authoritarian, strict and, at some points, abusive towards their son — often severely scolding him for circumstances that are entirely beyond his control. This has evidently affected Butters psychologically; he often tells himself off in the absence of his parents. It is also hinted that the justification for this abuse lacks rationality. As additional evidence of psychological problems, he has stated in "[[Super Best Friends]]" that he wakes up to the sound of his own screams. However, it is clear that Linda cares deeply for him; she becomes hysterical when he faked his death in "[[Marjorine]]", and becomes extremely distressed when he is missing in "[[Imaginationland]]" and "[[Casa Bonita]]". Also, before his father ever appeared in the show, an adult man who is very similar to Butters was seen as a background in early seasons.

He is intimidated of his dominating father, who he is obliged to respectfully refer to as "Sir". His father uses fear as his primary parenting tactic with Butters, once intentionally frightening him with threats of 'Super-AIDS'. It is shown on a number occasions that he really does care about Butters, but he believes his methods are the best way in which to raise him. Linda, however, has been shown to be much more tender to her son, hugging and kissing him often. She seems to go along with Stephen's harshness only because she believes that its the best of her son.

It was revealed in "[[AWESOM-O]]" that his family includes an aunt and uncle who live in Los Angeles, Butters' claims in "[[The Return of Chef]]" that his [[Budd Stotch|Uncle Budd]] molested him. There was a mention of a grandmother in "[[Freak Strike]]" who had a stroke shortly after she saw Butters on television with testicles on his chin and then his parents went to visit her in the hospital. Ten seasons later, Butters mentions his grandma again in "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]", stating she is from Virginia. In "[[Butterballs]]", [[Grandma Stotch]] gets a prominent role, constantly bullying her grandson, which makes her another member of the Stotch family that abuses Butters. It is unknown if that grandma was his maternal or paternal grandmother, or the same one that is mentioned in the episodes before that. Also, while Butters and all members of his family shown appear to be entirely Caucasian, Cartman's repeated insult to Butters is "Butters you black asshole". Instead of suggesting that Butters has some African or Afro-American descent, it is more likely that this is simply a childish insult out of Cartman's stupidity, ironic due to Butters showing no stereotypical African-American traits, and often exhibiting stereotypical Caucasian-American traits.

====Abuse and Neglect====
[[File:Butters barbies.jpg|thumb|Butters playing with his Barbie and his cut out doll of himself.]]
Stephen and Linda are very strict with Butters and have both abused and neglected him in one way or another or after his friends get him in serious trouble. He is usually grounded after he gets involved with something, because they usually conclude that it was either Butters all on his own or that he at least played a major role, and do not believe that he is being bullied. They have also threatened to ground Butters for things he cannot control, such as in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", Stephen orders him to stop having nightmares or he would be grounded. Also in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]", Butters' parents ground him for making a silly face in his school photo, believe he is wearing make-up at one point (he is not at all) in and are convinced that his normal face is "silly" and has "made himself look like a girl". It is assumed that Linda and Stephen actually have some sort of compulsive need to punish Butters, as demonstrated in "[[The Ungroundable]]", during which they threaten to ground him for minor mistakes such as misplacing the chocolate Quick mix. When Butters, under the belief that he is a vampire, refuses to listen to their threats, they become unnerved and afraid that they will never be able to ground Butters again. After Butters returns to his normal behavior, his parents become immensely relieved that they again have dominion over their son, and immediately proceed to ground him again.

In "[[The List]]", it is shown that Butters parents were planning to ground him if the girls at school thought he was the ugliest in the class. Stephen also physically beats Butters in "[[Jared Has Aides]]" - Cartman pretended to be Butters on the phone and insulted his parents, really goading them. Then he sat outside to hear Stephen and Linda tear through him. Considering Stephen and Linda's possible problems controlling their anger, it is likely that "[[Jared Has Aides]]" was not the only time he was beaten.

The most distinguishing abuse was in the season five episode "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]" which centered on how Linda sent Butters to spy on his father to find out what he was getting Linda for their wedding anniversary, and, among other things, Butters saw Stephen go into a men's bathhouse. Butters did not understand what it was and told his mother, who then, in a spot of insanity, attempted to kill Butters by pushing a car with Butters inside off a dock. Linda then wrote a suicide note and was about to kill herself just when Stephen stepped in; the resulting confrontation changed her mind about suicide. Stephen and Linda tried to keep Butters' murder a secret and blamed it on "some Puerto Rican guy". Butters meanwhile found a way home and his parents came clean. When he found out that his mother had tried to kill him and his father was gay (or rather bisexual), he was horrified, but tried to pass it off. When asked if he was really going to be okay after discovering all that he admitted "No, I'm lying."

At the end of the sixth season, in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", Butters gets revenge on his parents for their abuse of him (culminating in them hiring an actor to pretend to be Butters' future self so as to scare him out of doing drugs) by paying Cartman to smear feces all over his house. The act ironically leads the [[:Category:Stotch Family|Stotches]] to realize how badly they have treated their son and they apologize, an act that is contrasted by Stan Marsh's parents refusing to apologize for them hiring an actor to be Stan's future self, to the extent that they mutilate their actor when Stan tricks them into thinking he chopped off his own hand. Since then, the Stotches have not been shown hurting their son physically and in "[[About Last Night...]]", Stephen tells Butters that he loves him. However, he did believe that the world was soon going to end as [[Barack Obama|Obama]] won the presidential election so one could think this was because Stephen was going hysterical or he wanted to make peace with his son.

Despite all the abuse Butters has received, his parents have been shown to really care deeply about their son, this can be seen in "[[Marjorine]]" where they go as far as to even promise him not to ground him "for more than a couple weeks" if he does not kill himself. As shown in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]" they sell a reluctant Butters to Paris Hilton for $250 million. Butters realizes that many of Paris' pets have killed themselves and gets away, and [[Paris Hilton|Paris]] is swallowed anally by [[Mr. Slave]]. As a result, his parents ground him. In "[[The Return of Chef]]", Butters briefly mentions that his [[Budd Stotch|Uncle Budd]] has committed sexual acts on him, but has not realized that it is sexual molestation.

===Unnamed Cat===
In "[[Jared Has Aides]]", after Butters returns home, Cartman notes that he fed Butters' cat. The cat has since not been mentioned and has yet to make an appearance.

==Interactions==
{{Main|Butters Stotch/Interactions}}
[[File:Butters_(Facebook).jpg|thumb|right|Butters' profile picture on Facebook which can be found on his official [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Leopold-Butters-Stotch/8986263900 Facebook page]. It can also been seen in the background of "[[You Have 0 Friends]]".]]
In "[[Jared Has Aides]]", he was chosen by Stan, Kyle, and Cartman as their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died. Later, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman decided that they did not like Butters and chose [[Tweek]] to "fill the void" instead. However, he seems to be friends with classmate [[Pip Pirrup|Pip]], and second grader Dougie in earlier episodes, as seen in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" and "[[Professor Chaos]]". Butters is often referred to as "a little pussy", "wuss", "lame", "gaywad", and "faggot" by the boys. The boys got him to take the fall for everything they did - often getting Butters grounded in the process. Despite all these occurrences, Butters still seems to consider the boys "friends". Butters is the friend [[the boys]] hang out with the most. In "[[Toilet Paper]]", Butters mentioned he had a girlfriend named Carrie in Michigan. Aside from this instance, she is never mentioned again. In "[[Raisins]]", Butters developed a crush on [[Lexus]], a waitress at the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]]. However, his strong feelings for her were one-sided; she had only been using him for his money, as all Raisins employees do. Lexus would eventually cause Butters to become depressed, although he quickly got over it. In "[[Fatbeard]]" it was revealed that Cartman is the only person who still picks on him (it is likely that the rest of the boys consider him a friend, for example, Kyle seems genuinely concerned about Butters' "pimping" and personality change in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]").

===[[Eric Cartman]]===
Butters has become Cartman's most frequent bullying victim. Butters sees Cartman sometimes as a friend and treats him as so. However, Cartman takes advantage of this and finds Butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view, or get him to do what he wants. He is often extremely cruel to him, and uses him as a scapegoat whenever he needs someone to blame. He constantly makes fun of him for his effeminate tendencies and his naive, innocent, nature, often calling him "gay". Butters does not even take a stand on Cartman and that somehow, Butters is the only character who does not hate Cartman despite all the cruelty he receives from Cartman. 

In "[[Douche and Turd]]", Cartman easily gets Butters to vote for his idea of a "turd sandwich" simply by describing the candidates in a misleading way. In "[[Go God Go]]", he gets Butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the Wii video game console. Butters is in heart hurt by all of Cartman's bullying and when Cartman goes too far with it, it gives Butters the opportunity to make Cartman pay for his bullying and cruelty. However, in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", Butters helps Cartman apologize to everyone he offended and after this, Cartman personally apologizes to Butters for all the things he did Butters wrong at and Butters seems to forgive Eric without hesitation.

In many episodes entire plots are centered on Cartman's antics against Butters. In "[[Jared Has Aides]]", Cartman gets Butters grounded and makes several prank calls to Butters's parents. Cartman then frames Butters for making the prank calls by imitating his voice, which leads to both parents beating and abusing Butters. 

In "[[Casa Bonita]]", Cartman faked an apocalypse so Butters would hide in a bomb shelter for three days, so Cartman could go with Kyle, Stan, and Kenny to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]], instead of Butters. However the other boys found out about this and Cartman gets arrested for causing Butters' disappearance and was sentenced to a week in juvenile hall. In "[[AWESOM-O]]", Cartman dressed as a robot to trick Butters, but in the end this failed miserably. Butters happily got his revenge by publicly showing a tape of Cartman dressed like [[Britney Spears]] trying to woo over a cardboard standee of [[Justin Timberlake]]. 

In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", Butters also gets revenge at Cartman by farting on his face and giving him the finger for swearing Jesus' name in front of everybody and ruining their band. He also taunts Cartman for being the real 'ugliest' kid in their class and mocks his neo-Nazism in a deleted scene in "[[The List]]". In "[[Pee]]", Butters remarks "Aw, you lived?" when he sees Cartman. In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", most kids at [[South Park Elementary]] ignore Cartman because they feel he deserves it. Unlike the other boys, Butters is not aware of the plan and Cartman believes that Butters is the only one who can see him now that he is "dead".

In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", he repeatedly invited Butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him, including putting cat poop on his face and moon Butters. It backfired when he made an inappropriate picture, featuring him putting Butters' penis in his mouth, and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class. In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", after Cartman gets brutalized by Wendy, Butters agreed with Craig that he always hated Cartman with everyone else, which made it clear that Butters was finally standing up to Cartman, even though we initially seemed to be on Cartman's side as he said "I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her." This has not seemed to stick, as he goes right back to Cartman's side in "[[The China Probrem]]", acting as Cartman's sidekick. 

In "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]", Cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards Butters after he is queefed upon, and even gives him a present. He then participated in a statewide attempt to ban queefing, with Butters as a mascot, although he refuses to go near Butters after he was queefed on. Cartman "punishes" Butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl during fourth grade in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]". 

In "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", Cartman posted wanted signs of Butters that authorized the U.S border patrol to shoot and kill Butters on sight. When Cartman joined the border patrol, he tried to murder Butters but failed. It is revealed in "[[Going Native]]" that Butters is sick and tired of putting up with Cartman getting the last words. In "[[Skank Hunt]]" Butters joins Kyle, Stan, Token, Craig, Clyde, and Jimmy to smash his electronics due to them thinking that he was [[Skankhunt42]].

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
His friendship with Kyle is fairly decent; Kyle treats Butters more kindly than the other boys, as seen when he decided to take Butters along to Casa Bonita for his birthday. In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", Kyle attempted to tell Butters how Cartman was taking advantage of him whilst he slept over at his house. However, Kyle is not against using Butters as a "guinea pig" when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs. Kyle occasionally makes fun of Butters, swears at him, or calls him names, as well as using him as a scapegoat (along with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny) whenever he needs someone else to take blame. He also agreed with Cartman's plan to kill Butters after Kenny threw shuriken stuck in his eye in "[[Good Times with Weapons]]" to avoid punishment. Under the influence of ''hapahui apahoha'' in "[[Going Native]]", Butters angrily tells Kyle, "You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle? Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert!" Butters has harassed Kyle, as shown in "[[The List]]", and "bullies" him for being Jewish, usually because of Cartman's influence and manipulation. Kyle generally sees Butters as a close friend and Butters sees him as a close friend too. Kyle also defended Butters for not kissing a girl in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]".

===[[Kenny McCormick]]===
Butters took Kenny's place after he died, leading to more interaction between the two in later episodes. Butters friendship to Kenny seems to be stronger than Cartman, since Cartman usually makes fun of both Butters and Kenny. In "[[Kenny Dies]]", Butters draws a picture of him and Kenny (as best friends) together in an airplane, which Kyle delivers to Kenny at the hospital. Kenny plays the "good cop" and comforts Butters in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]" and Butters tries to help Kenny with his cat-pee addiction during "[[Major Boobage]]". The two are also playing together in a sandbox in "[[Eek, A Penis!]]". In "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", Kenny and Butters can be seen hugging when Stan and Kyle break 100,000 points on Guitar Hero. Also, in "[[The Ring]]", Butters seems quite alarmed when he discovered Kenny has a "whore" girlfriend. Butters is also often sharing things with Kenny like in "[[Fat Camp]]" when he shares his cup to scoop up Kenny's puke when he is dared to eat it. In "[[Going Native]]" he admits that Kenny is the only person in school that has a sense of dignity. When the natives of Hawaii want to kill Kenny for being an outsider Butters stands in their way considering Kenny as his best friend. At the end of the episode both of the boys get Hawaii rewards cards.

===[[Token Black]]===
[[Token]] and Butters are often seen together in many episodes, most notably in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]", in which they are seen together throughout the whole episode. When they were at Sunday School, Token is seen next to Butters when he goes to tell [[The Boys|the boys]] about Timmy. When Kenny gets [[List of Kenny's Deaths|run over]], they are next to each other crossing the street, and when they sneak into the church they are seen together again. In "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" they are seen on the same sled. In the class room they sit next to each other. They also both join Cartman's Band "Faith+1" in "[[Christian Rock Hard]]". In the beginning of "The List", when Butters tells the boys that the girls in their classroom have a list rating every boy from cutest to ugliest, Token asks him which one of the boys is the ugliest, to which Butters says he does not know yet, saying that the girls woudl not let anyone else but themselves see the list. Although Token and Butters are known to be on good terms with each other, in the end of "[[W.T.F.]]", they are seen fighting with each other, blaming each other for the loss of stardom of the W.T.F. while Cartman and Kyle fight each other for the same reason, as well as Stan and Jimmy fighting each other for the same reason.

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
Stan's friendship with Butters is similar to that of Kyle's: he can be friendly to Butters, hanging out with him in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]" when the two of them learned the truth behind "Motivation Corp", to using Butters as a scapegoat (along with Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny) or as a "guinea pig" for the boys' antics, such as in "[[Jared Has Aides]]". In "[[Going Native]]", Butters tells Stan that he is a "kid who thinks that the entire planet revolves around him and only cares about ''his'' image". Otherwise, whenever Butters stands up to Stan, he does so towards all the boys: "You're all fake and stuck up! The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts!" ("[[Going Native]]").  Butters and Stan have also had more amicable moments. In "[[Raisins]]", Stan defended Butters' speech ("No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.") and ditched the goth kids when he realized, "[Butters] is right. I like life a lot more than hating it." At the end of "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", Butters took Stan's place in the game, and told Cartman that he wanted to be the betrayer when he reached a celebrity-like status. Butters also revealed to Stan alone that he was Professor Chaos. Although Stan took it to mean that he was coming out of the closet, he said he was okay with it. 

===[[Charlotte]]===
[[File:WhereMyCountryGone067.png|thumb|right]]
Butters met Charlotte in "[[Where My Country Gone?]]", after being forced by the other boys to find a Canadian girl to have a "Hot Cosby" with to establish peace. Though Butters was reluctant at first, he and Charlotte developed feelings for each other and decided to take things slow. Charlotte and her family returned to Canada at the end of the episode, but she promised to Skype Butters when she got home. 

In "[[Tweek x Craig]]" they are seen Skyping with each other. They Skype again in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", with Butters affectionately calling her "baby" and "honey". However, in "[[Wieners Out]]", Butters and Charlotte have ended their relationship, with Charlotte deciding to join the girls' protest against the boys.

===[[Craig Tucker]]===
Craig and Butters seemed to have been friends at one time in the earlier seasons. In "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" they bully [[Mark Cotswolds]] throughout the episode. In "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]" they are at the gas station together when the couple arrive; Butters was the mechanic and Craig was playing spaceman. In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]" they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight [[Wendy Testaburger]]. However, later in the series their friendship seems to have vanished; in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]" Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tether ball while he is tied to the tether ball pole. Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not Butters was present at dinner in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", noting, "Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not." which is ironic considering the fact Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character. However a benevolent situation occurred in "[[Bass to Mouth]]" where Butters was looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan; Craig was getting along with Butters. In "[[The Magic Bush]]", Butters shows he cares about Craig when Cartman posts videos of [[Laura Tucker]] on the internet.
