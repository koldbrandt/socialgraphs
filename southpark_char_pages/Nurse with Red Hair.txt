The '''Nurse with Red Hair''' is a nurse who first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]", where she is in charge of caring for the elderly [[Rod Stewart]].

==Background==
In "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]", the nurse is the elderly Rod Stewart's primary caregiver. When [[Jesus Christ]] visits Stewart at his mansion in preparation for his millennium concert, he is shocked to find out the state he is in. Wheelchair-bound, barely able to mumble his words, and suffering from fecal incontinence, he is very dependent on his nurse. She treats him in a very undignified, condescending manner as though he is a young child. When he "poops his pants", she reprimands him, "Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie?"

At the millennium concert, Rod soils himself on stage. The nurse brings a bucket and attends to him on stage instead of wheeling him away to do so.

In "[[Kenny Dies]]" the nurse is seen working at the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]], where she sends an aborted fetus to the [[Alder Research Group]] for stem cell research.

==Appearance==
The nurse with red hair has long red hair, long eyelashes, and red lipstick. She wears a white nurse's outfit consisting a nurse's cap, a collared short-sleeved shirt, a skirt, and white shoes. She wears a knee-length skirt in "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]" and an ankle-length skirt in "[[Kenny Dies]]". She bears some similarity to [[Nurse Jillian]] in the face.

==Prominence==
*"[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]" - [[Rod Stewart]]'s nurse.
*"[[Kenny Dies]]" - Seen working at the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]].
