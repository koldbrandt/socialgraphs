'''Linda Black''' is [[Token Black]]'s mother and [[Steve Black]]'s wife. She made her first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]".

==Background==
She first appears in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", briefly, as she directs [[The Boys|the boys]] to her husband. She was later seen in the background when Chef was protesting the [[South Park Flag]] in "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", before reappearing in "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", in which Token begins to question why they are so rich, and while everyone else is poor. It is revealed that Mrs. Black is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company. She is horrified when Token wants to shop at J-Mart, and seems to not understand how to shop like middle-class people.

Her next appearance with a speaking role was in "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]", in which she and her husband become horrified when discovering that Token has seen the porno-film ''[[Back Door Sluts 9]]'', thinking that it was ''Lord of the Rings''. When her husband [[Steve Black]] then exclaims "Oh god, not that one!", Mrs. Black shoots him a furious look.

==Appearance==
Mrs. Black has dreadlocks that are held high with a red bobble. She often wears big-hooped earrings, a white-collared shirt with a green v-neck jumper, a blue skirt, and black shoes.

==Trivia==
*The Black family was once named "The Williams" in "Here Comes the Neighborhood".
*In "Proper Condom Use", [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] says she agrees with what Bob and Linda said while at the Book Club. Since the names of all of the other parents present (except Mrs. Tweak) had been given, fans gather it may be the Blacks parents' names. However, in "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers", Mr. Black is referred to as Steve.
