'''Doctor Tom''' is a rhinologist and surgeon who owns the commonly-seen business, [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]]. He was first seen in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]".

==Background==
Doctor Tom is first referred as the owner of [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]], a business seen in several episodes of the show as a prominent location on [[Main Street]], though the interior has only been seen in three instances.

In "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]", Doctor Tom advises [[Herbert Garrison]] on the new nose he has always wanted, selecting a procedure that makes him resemble actor [[David Hasselhoff]] and causes him to be incredibly attractive.

In "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]", the interior of his business can be seen, where [[Sharon Marsh]] acts as a receptionist. He makes a cameo in the film during the final sequence.

In "[[The City Part of Town]]", he is seen cleaning the building in preparation for the arrival of the [[Whole Foods Representative]] and is also seen eating at [[SoDoSoPa]] with other townspeople.

In "[[Members Only]]", he performs surgery again on Garrison, inviting his advisors [[Reince Priebus]] and [[Steve Bannon]] to see the results.

==Appearance==
Tom is a young doctor, who slightly resembles [[Christopher Reeve]]. He is a muscular man with attractive features that may be natural or be altered via plastic surgery, he wears a white lab coat and green doctors scrubs. Tom's appearance has been slightly redesigned in his most recent appearance on "[[Members Only]] ", and he now has a larger head and a slightly thinner build.
