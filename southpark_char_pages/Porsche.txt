==Personality==
Porsche is a rather sweet girl but she seems dim-witted. While meaning well, she seems oblivious to the fact that her excessive talking is annoying to some.

An example of her low IQ is shown when she mistook cancer for a canker sore (calling it a "cancer sore") during a conversation with [[Butters Stotch]]'s parents.

==Prominence==
*"[[Raisins]]" - Debut episode.
*"[[You Got F'd in the A]]" - She made a brief appearance where she was seen greeting the boys at the door.
*"[[Goobacks]]" - She was seen with [[Mercedes]], picking up trash.
*"[[The Scoots]]" - Seen as one of the trick-or-treaters riding e-scooters for Halloween.
*"[[Unfulfilled]]" - Seen with [[Mercedes]], admiring [[Larry Zewiski]]'s bike.
