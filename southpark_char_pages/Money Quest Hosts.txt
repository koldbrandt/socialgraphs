The '''''Money Quest'' Hosts''' appear in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Cartmanland]]".

==Background==
[[Eric Cartman]] inherits one million dollars from his [[Mabel Cartman|grandmother]] and decides to use the money to purchase [[North Park Funland]] so that he could enjoy the attractions all to himself. However, Cartman is forced to allow other people into the park, on top of expenses required to maintain the park itself, eventually seeing many more attendees per day than it could in the past. This made its way to a HBC television program known as ''Money Quest'', where its hosts praise Cartman for turning the fortunes of the theme park, calling Cartman the "financial genius of our time" and reporting that there are other businesses attempting to adopt similar tactics.

Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] who is suffering from hemorrhoid in response to Cartman's one million dollar inheritance, passes out upon watching the program.

==Appearance==
One of the hosts is overweight and has balding brown hair with beard. He wears a green suit over yellow collared shirt, black tie, and black shoes.

The other host has a neatly combed black hair. He wears a burgundy vest over a white shirt and gray-striped tie, black pants, and black shoes.
