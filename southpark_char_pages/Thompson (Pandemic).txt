Later, a guard calls up Thompson to help translate what the musicians were trying to tell them. Thompson explains that the musicians are the "protectors" from [[Furry Death]].

Thompson has thick blond hair, and wears a brown suit with yellow shirt and a dark blue tie. He carries a megaphone, only using it when translating Chertoff's announcement.
