'''Mr. Scientist''' is an unnamed scientist who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode "[[AWESOM-O]]".

==Background==
The scientist first appears in the [[Pentagon]] along with other military workers, who are talking about [[Eric Cartman]] (who is in his [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]] costume) being used to come up with movie ideas. When the general says they could turn him into a weapon, the scientist says that turning the robot into a weapon is unethical. Later on, he discovers that A.W.E.S.O.M.-O has "developed consciousness", not knowing that he is a real boy. The military general orders the scientist to erase A.W.E.S.O.M-O's memory. Later, he attempts to get A.W.E.S.O.M.-O out of the pentagon, but is shot in the stomach by one of the military soldiers. As [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] shows up to protect A.W.E.S.O.M.-O, the scientist pulls out some of his organs, resulting in his death.

Though he is unnamed, he is repeatedly and mockingly referred to as "Mr. Scientist" by the military general.

==Appearance==
The scientist has short light brown hair and light brown eyebrows. He wears a white lab coat over a sky blue shirt with his name tag on the left side as well as a black belt, blue pants, black shoes, and black glasses.
