The '''NFL Owners and Presidents''' are featured in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Go Fund Yourself]]".

==Background==
The new [[Washington Redskins (Startup Company)]] owned by [[Eric Cartman]] uses [[Kickstarter]] to get financial backing to do absolutely nothing. This tarnishes the image of [[Washington Redskins (Football Team)]]. The owner, [[Dan Snyder]], is unable to get Cartman to change the name of the company. After unsuccessfully trying to get help from the the [[Roger Goodell|Goodell-bot]] which malfunctions, Dan calls for an emergency meeting of all the NFL Owners and Presidents with the exception of the Buffalo Bills. They agree to pressure Cartman into changing his company logo, which is the same as the logo of the football team. However, Cartman alters the logo to be more offensive and sarcastic.
