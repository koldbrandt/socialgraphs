The '''Denver Broncos''' are the NFL team of [[Denver, Colorado]]. They are the overall favored team of the whole community of ''[[South Park]]'' and are as such, mentioned numerous times. [[John Elway]], a now former star quarterback, is a hero to a majority of the South Park characters.

==Background==
The entire Bronco team makes their first on-screen appearances in the episode "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]" and "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", when it is revealed that on the night of the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], [[Eric Cartman]]'s mother [[Liane Cartman]] proceeded to have sex with a large number of men and woman, including the entire Denver Broncos team, which left into question who amongst all the participating men was Cartman's father. In the end however it was revealed that his father was his mother Liane, due to having both male and female genitals.

This episode, and the Broncos, appeared again the episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]", in which during a series of flashback, Cartman recalls the discovery of his father, however he intentionally alters the memory to where he claims John Elway to be his father, rather than Liane.

During Kenny's funeral in "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", [[Priest Maxi]] ignores Kenny's death, and instead gives a speech about the Bronco and leads the congregation in a cheer for the team.

In the episode "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", after the kids of South Park get rid of the adults with claims of molestation, they create a tribal community in which they sacrifice one of their own each night to a statue of John Elway.

During "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", [[Jack Tenorman]] who would later be revealed to be right tackle for the Denver Broncos, and father of Cartman's arch-foe [[Scott Tenorman]], appears, in which he catches [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Ned Gerblansky]], Eric Cartman, [[Randy Marsh]], [[Gerald Broflovski]] and several other men watching his wife undress from the bushes outside his house. Later, when Scott convinces his parents that a pony is being abused at [[Farmer Carl Denkins]]'s Ranch, they go to save the pony, are killed by the farmer on sight because Cartman fabricated to Denkins that they were deranged pony-killers. They were then ground up into chili by Cartman who later tricks their son Scott into eating them.

In "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]", the boys were told to root for their "team." So Stan places up an American flag, says "go America" and then "go Denver Broncos".

In "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]", during Butter's theme song, its shown that [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] is a Broncos fan and has a signed photo of himself with John Elway.

In"[[201]]", it is revealed that the events of "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]" were all a lie created to hide the truth about Cartman's father, due to the fact that the Broncos were having a good season, and everyone feared that the scandal of an illegitimate child amongst the players would be a distraction. It was revealed that the father of Cartman's arch-foe Scott Tenorman, was a right tackle of the Denver Broncos, and that on the night of the Drunken Barn Dance, the ginger-haired Jack Tenorman was the player that got Liane pregnant with Eric, thus making Scott his half-brother.

The Denver Broncos return in "[[Sarcastaball]]", where Randy Marsh accidentally invents a sport while trying to be sarcastic during a PTA meeting. The new sport named [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|sarcastaball]], is meant to be gentler than football by replacing the uniforms with brassieres and tinfoil hats and the ball with a balloon. Instead of tackling, the players hug while the quarterback compliments the opposing team. The sport becomes so popular the NFL asks Randy to be the new coach of the Denver Broncos Sarcastaball team.

==Appearance==
The Denver Broncos' uniform consists of orange jerseys with the player number in white and outlined in blue, white pants with orange stripes, and blue helmets with orange and white stripes. The uniforms prior to "[[Sarcastaball]]" are those worn by the Broncos until 1996. There are no other distinguishing features among the various team members.
