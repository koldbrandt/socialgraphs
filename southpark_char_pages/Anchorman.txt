The '''Anchorman''' appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]". He is portrayed by South Park editor Tom Vogt.

==Background==
After each successive commercial break, after the first, the Anchorman would say variations of the phrase, "fighting the frizzies at 11". During the episode's credits, he fights a "frizzie" in a boxing match.

This is a take on a real promo spot for a newscast that's almost identical and that can be seen on most bootleg versions of "The Star Wars Holiday Special".

==Appearance==
The Anchorman has combed darkish brown hair and a brown mustache. He wears a black suit coat, a white formal shirt, and a blue striped tie. He also wears white boxer shorts with a black trim.
