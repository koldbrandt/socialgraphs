'''Michael Collins''' is a representative of the Christian Recording Industry who appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode "[[Christian Rock Hard]]".

==Background==
[[Eric Cartman]], along with his [[Faith + 1]] members [[Token Black]] and [[Butters Stotch]], having sold one million copies of their [[Faith + 1 (Album)|album]], were invited to an award ceremony to be presented with a "platinum award". However on the ceremony proper, Michael Collins presents them a "myrrh" album instead, further explaining that in Christian rock music, album tiers are named gold, frankincense, and myrrh. This enrages Cartman who now knows that he could never actually have a "platinum" album, going against Collin's advice on not using [[Jesus Christ]]'s name in vain.

==Appearance==
Michael Collins wears a navy blue suit with white shirt and red tie.
