'''David Letterman''' is an American television host best known for hosting ''Late Night With David Letterman'' from 1982 until 1992, after which he left NBC due to [[Jay Leno]] being named Johnny Carson's successor of ''The Tonight Show''. The next year he began ''The Late Show With David Letterman'' on CBS, which he has hosted since with [[Paul Shaffer]] from August 30, 1993 until May 20, 2015.

==Background==
[[File:Davidletterman.jpg|thumb|left|David Letterman in "[[Fishsticks]]".]] 
He first appeared as one of the talk show hosts who helped spread the [[Fishsticks Joke]] in the episode, "[[Fishsticks]]", performing the joke on Paul Shaffer in a short montage of comedians performing it for their guests. He then later appeared in "[[Sexual Healing]]", in which he was being treated at the [[Karne Institute for Sex Addiction]] as a sex addict, a reference to his then-recent sex scandal (he mentions "having sex with employees"). Letterman learned that his sex addiction was caused by the [[Wizard Alien]] and partied after its death. He is among the other celebrities to sue South Park in "[[200]]" and "[[201]]", though he has no lines of his own.

He makes yet another appearance in "[[Funnybot]]" wherein he is one of the many comedians taking South Park Elementary hostage, though he has no lines. This marked his fifth appearance, but in addition, made him the celebrity to make the most appearances on South Park with no change in appearance/design, with the exception of [[Saddam Hussein]]. (Many other celebrities who have reappeared had design changes).
