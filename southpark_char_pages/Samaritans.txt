'''Samaritans''' are an ethnoreligious group which descend from the mixture of [[Hebrews|Israelites]] and exiled Middle Eastern people who were brought into [[Israel]] by the Assyrians as part of their populations' swapping form of punishment. They were in love-hate relationship with the [[Jews]] till after the death of [[Jesus]], when they had a common enemy: the [[Wikipedia:Roman Empire|Roman]] and later [[Wikipedia:Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]], which persecuted them for not being Christian.

==History==
The Samaritans are humoristically mentioned as candidates for the ones who built the Pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]] in "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]".
