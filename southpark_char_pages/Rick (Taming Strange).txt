'''Rick''' is [[Terry]]'s friend who appears in [[Season Seventeen]] episode "[[Taming Strange]]".

==Background==
At a Canadian pub, [[Terry]] has a talk with Rick about the former's wife queefing on his face. Rick advised that there is an underlying issue regarding Terry's appointment as the Canadian Minister of Health, and it needs to be resolved as soon as possible in order to save their marriage.

Later, Rick pointed out to Terry that the IntelliLink had been the root cause of his problems: The system caused Terry to be very defensive and hostile, and thus led Terry's wife to queef on his face.

==Appearance==
Rick appears with full grey hair and beard. He wears a grey sweater, a red scarf, and blue pants.

==Trivia==
*Even though he is reffered to onscreen a 'Rick', he is referred to on the commentary for the episode as 'Fancy Fwiend' repeatedly by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], who joked about doing an entire episode around the character, "My Dinner with Fancy Fwiend" in parody of the film ''My Dinner With Andre''.
