'''David Blaine''' is an American illusionist who first appeared in the [[Season Five]] episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", where he is the main antagonist.

==Background==
In "[[Super Best Friends]]", [[Seaman]] explains that David Blaine was raised in New York City by a decent family, but a freak washing machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts. His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand.

He is the leader of the suicide cult religion, "Blaintology" who views his magic tricks as holy "miracles". He considers himself God, but the Super Best Friends halt the suicides and destroy Blaine's giant [[Abraham Lincoln]] statue with their own giant [[John Wilkes Booth]] statue. Blaine escapes with a jet.

Blaine appears again in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Krazy Kripples]]", as a member of [[Christopher Reeve|Christopher Reeve's]] [[Legion of Doom]]. His most recent appearance was in the episode "[[201]]", as one of the celebrities who is suing South Park.

==Appearance==
David Blaine has short black hair and his facial hair is growing in. When doing street magic, he wears black pants, a black long-sleeve shirt, and black shoes. When acting as the leader of his religion he wears a white t-shirt which buttons up and has a collar.

==Personality==
Blaine is an evil, diabolical and power-hungry individual, who revels in the dark arts and manipulates gullible individuals into following his suicidal death cult. He has a callous and cruel disregard regard for the lives of his members, who he is willing to sacrifice on a mass scale, in order for him to take over the world as a supervillain. He is also extremely narcissistic and suffers from a God-complex, believing his magic tricks and spells to be "holy miracles" and envisions himself as a messiah of sorts.
