'''Frosty''' appeared in student short film ''Jesus vs. Frosty''. A prototype of [[the boys]] accidentally brought a snowman to life with a magic hat, parodying the Rankin/Bass special ''Frosty the Snowman''. Instead of being kind, the snowman is evil and murders [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], the only character with a name.

The film features four kids who are very similar of the four main characters of ''[[South Park]]'', including a character resembling Cartman, but called "Kenny", and three nameless boys resembling [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].

==Appearance==
Frosty had red eyes and a wide mouth with sharp teeth. He wore a top hat and was made out of snow. He also had blue tentacles.

==Trivia==
*Frosty has had the longest absence among all characters from the show.
*Frosty is the only character that appeared in a pre-South Park short but not in the main series.
