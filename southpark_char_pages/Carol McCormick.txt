'''Carol McCormick''' is the wife to [[Stuart McCormick]], as well as the mother of [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]], and [[Karen McCormick|Karen]].

==Background==
===Religion===
Her family seems to be fairly religious and Roman Catholic, like most of the townspeople. She yells at Kenny for wanting to miss church in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' to go watch ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' while Stuart stood up for the Church in "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]", where they were one of the few families in town that didn't convert to atheism. They also continue to pray after Kenny has died on a few occasions, and Kenny's funerals, when they occur, are always religious in nature.

In "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", it is revealed that she joined [[Cult of Cthulhu|The Cult of Cthulhu]] for free beer and regrets it because she has to rebirth Kenny every time he dies.

===Interests===
She seems to like knitting. In "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", she is shown knitting when Kenny tells her that he made her favorite drink. She also says that knitting a sweater is better than molesting children in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]".

===Voice Acting===
From 1997 to 1999, she was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. Bergman described the character as one of her five favorite voice roles in the series, together with [[Liane Cartman]], [[Sheila Broflovski]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Shelly Marsh]], also mentioning that she based the voice of the character on a "female version of Bill Clinton".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wackyvoices.com/south.html |title=The Babes of South Park |accessdate=April 25, 2009}}</ref> After Bergman's death, the character was voiced by [[Eliza Schneider]], from 1999 to 2003. Since 2004, her voice has been provided by [[April Stewart]].

==Appearance==
[[File:45a.jpg|thumb|left|Carol on the SP-site]]
Carol wears a lime-green T-shirt which usually reads "I'm with Stupid", and dark blue jeans. The arrow is supposed to point at Stuart, but she is usually standing on the wrong side of him, so it points off in some other direction. Her hair is red, and similar in style to [[Red]]'s, but her bangs go in the same direction as [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s. She has a shadowy patch on her right cheek, which may be a bruise, or simply filth.[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus_(6).png|thumb|Carol in her formal attire in "[[Quintuplets 2000]]"]]

In "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", her shirt had an American flag embroidered on it, accompanied by the phrase "God Bless". When the McCormick's went on the John Denver experience, however, it appeared as a solid green T-shirt. In "[[Best Friends Forever]]", it is a solid, but darker green.

For special occasions, she wears a fake fur coat with a red crop top underneath and a red miniskirt, but as of [[Season Twelve]] she would wear a dark green blouse and a long gray skirt. although in recent seasons she seems to have a much more black fancy shirt and dress with a veil. 

At night, she wears a nightshirt with several bunnies on it and pajama pants.

As of "[[The Ring]]", like many other adults, her appearance has been cleaned up, including small subtle changes to her hairstyle, T-shirt, arms and pants.
{{GallerySubPage|name=Carol McCormick}}

==Personality==
[[Image:210_parents_with_herpes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Her original appearance]]
Like her husband, [[Stuart McCormick]], she is drunk more often than not, though she does seem a lot more controlled with her drinking. She and Stuart are usually fighting and bickering, with Carol saying that if Stuart would stop drinking and being lazy, and get a job, they might not be so hungry and poor. Like Stuart does to her, she sometimes beats him physically, [[Chickenlover|once giving him a black eye.]] She seems to have strength, seeing as when she hits Stuart. She also tackled Gerald Broflovski to the ground in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]".

Carol does care for Stuart deep down, though, as she was concerned for him when he went ill after consuming a drink mixed with abortion medication, got his nose broken on the John Denver experience, and was molested by the entire [[NAMBLA]] Society in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]". However, she also seems to think that the McCormick residence primarily belongs to her, as in "[[Chickenlover]]", she says (regarding Stuart): "I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!" and yells a similar phrase at him in "[[Best Friends Forever]]". However, Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] built that same house when they were teenagers, as revealed in "[[Chickenpox]]".

In the episode "[[Mysterion Rises]]", it is revealed she had been part of a cult centered around Cthulhu ten years before the series' events and that she had been with Stuart at the time. Although she and her husband claim to have been extremely drunk while there, something their son does not question, it is hinted their involvement may have been greater. It is also revealed Kenny under the guise of [[Mysterion]] has been manipulating them to make them act better, promising him not to get high at night, not to fight as much, and to pay their children an allowance.

Over time, Carol has grown less stable, much like her husband, and more prone to drinking and violent behavior, notably in episodes such as "[[The Poor Kid]]".

She speaks with a thick Southern accent.

==Family==
===Father/Father-in-law===
It is unclear if Kenny's grandfather, seen in "[[Fat Camp]]", is her father or Stuart's, as his name was not given. However, Gerald mentions in "[[Chickenpox]]" that Stuart's father was an unemployed drunkard like Stuart; what can be taken from this is ambiguous.

===Stuart McCormick===
{{Main|Stuart McCormick}}
[[File:Screen Shot 2016-01-19 at 9.19.25 PM.png|thumb|220x220px]]
Little is known of their past, but they have been together for at least ten years, likely as old as their elder son, and share a love of drinking and drugs. Although they fight extremely often and have severely beat each other, it seems to be reinforced that they do care about each other, particularly in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]".

===Kevin McCormick===
{{Main|Kevin McCormick}}
Kevin is her first born child. Little is known of his relationship with his mother, although she seems to care about him as she scolded Kenny for not sharing a blanket with Kevin in "[[Spookyfish]]". When Stuart and Kevin got into a drunken fight, Carol insulted both her husband and son but she also tried to stop Stuart from fighting Kevin in "[[The Poor Kid]]".

===Kenny McCormick===
{{Main|Kenny McCormick}}
Kenny is her second child and younger son. She does care deeply about her son, crying and being horrified at many of his deaths, and arranging funerals, despite an implied knowledge of the repetition of them. She tries to make extra allowances for him during her pregnancy so he does not feel left out or ignored. She is, however, somewhat confrontational with him at times, such as ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

She is afraid of his alter-ego in "[[Mysterion]]", whom he uses to scare his parents into submission and manipulate them. When her children are taken away she does not want to see them go.

In "[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]", she and her husband were shocked and extremely disturbed when Kenny's remains were delivered to them by Mr. Hankey, which further reinforces her love for him.

In "[[Best Friends Forever]]" she noticed how Kenny had done nothing but play his new PSP. It's shown that she doesn't want Kenny's future to be like her and Stuart's life.

In "[[Timmy 2000]]", she bought a hundred dollars' worth of [[Ritalin]] for Kenny's supposed ADD problem.

===Karen McCormick===
{{Main|Karen McCormick}}
Karen is her youngest child and only daughter. Karen is a rather shy and timid child, often relying on Kenny for support and protection, although she and her mother seem to have a good relationship. In "[[The Poor Kid]]", Carol holds Karen in her arms while trying to stop a fight between Stuart and Kevin, and Karen asks for her mother when she and her siblings are in [[The Soft Room]]. In "[[The City Part of Town]]", she holds Karen on her lap during the gentrification meeting and has her arm around her when they're sitting on their couch. She does care greatly for Karen's well-being, as shown in "[[Naughty Ninjas]]" when she is concerned about Karen bringing in a syringe from the homeless living outside their house.

==Trivia==
* At the end of "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", after Kenny dies, she gives birth to a baby who looks just like Kenny. She mentions this being the fifty-second occurrence of this happening. This indicates that every time Kenny dies, he is reborn and grows to be his age within a day's time. This is later reaffirmed in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" when Kenny kills himself at the end.
* Carol has a good memory as revealed in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", when she recounts that she had gotten pregnant fifty-two times, with each previous child dying.
* Carol McCormick's first name was unknown until ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where Stuart finally reveals that her name is Carol when the two were arguing. Her name itself may be both a reference to how both [[Liane Cartman|Liane Cartman's]] and [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski's]] first names were originally Carol, and how the majority of the fandom would refer to Carol by the name of Carol.
