'''Q-Money''' was [[Nut Gobbler]]'s pimp in "[[Erection Day]]". Q-Money kidnaps Nut Gobbler when he finds her and [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] at a [[Buca De Faggoncini|restaurant]], thinking Jimmy is her new pimp. Jimmy chases him in a Hollywood style high-speed chase to the roof of a building, where he pulls a gun on them. Jimmy distracts Q-Money with jokes, allowing Nut Gobbler to hit him with a metal pipe.

==Appearance==
Q-Money has small eyes, a large nose, short black hair, thick black eyebrows, and a thin, black goatee. He wore a black jacket, several silver necklaces, a diamond-studded, black and white watch, a gold watch, black pants, and white sneakers.
