'''Mayor McDaniels''' is the mayor of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She made her first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", and still continues to make prominent appearances.

==Background==
When [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] created the character of Mayor McDaniels, they wanted her to be a sophisticated and egotistical person as heard on the "[[Weight Gain 4000]]" commentary for [[South Park: The Complete First Season]]. She can be seen to fit this description, often being stubborn and sticking by her own decisions extensively.

Despite her normal manner, after the music festival in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]" got out of control, the Mayor attempted suicide after saying, "What have I done?" and shooting herself in the head. However, she is seen to have survived in the same episode with a blood-stained bandage around her head. She has since returned to her regular personality and is the go-to official when matters affect South Park or when a political representative for the town is needed for an episode.

==Appearance==
She wears a blue jacket and green trousers. She also wears gold earrings. Her hair is turquoise-blue, and her lips are rather thin.
{{GallerySubPage|name=Mayor McDaniels}}

==Personality==
[[File:13a.jpg|thumb|left|The Mayor on South Park Studios]]
The Mayor acts like she is better than everyone else, most likely because she attended Princeton University. She also thinks South Park is a dump, as mentioned in several episodes. She tries to show that she has changed the town around, although, in reality, she is highly inactive. Though she occasionally seems like a relatively normal politician, she was happy to join [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], [[Jimbo]], and others in cannibalism by eating [[Eric Roberts]] and the rest of a cast and crew from Hollywood who came to film a re-enactment of the shooting of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]].

She once left the microphone on when [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] was giving out the prize for the best environmental essay and was overheard shouting she was "stuck in this stupid town with all these rednecks". Highly ambitious, it has been suggested she only became Mayor as a gateway to a higher political office in Colorado.

==Interactions==
In the earlier seasons of the show, it was implied that Mayor McDaniels was either a closeted lesbian or bisexual. In "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", she was seen at the [[City Hall]], in bed wearing a mudpack while reading a porn magazine called "''Gazunga's''", which had a busty woman on the cover. As the series progressed, the concept of bisexuality became more likely, as she has had a few relationships with women and men.
[[File:Screen Shot 2017-10-03 at 10.21.02 pm.png|thumb|Mayor McDaniels' loved one who passed away, perhaps her husband.]]
In "[[Tweek x Craig]]" it is implied that she may have lost a loved one in the past as there is a picture of a man on her desk that she holds to her chest and she is later seen visiting a gravestone, it may have been her husband.

Amongst the mixed implications of her sexuality, [[Officer Barbrady]] is implied to have had sexual relations with her in some episodes with questionable behavior in her office, though it is deliberately ambiguous and mainly with implication. Indeed, the South Park Studios biography states that; "she and Officer Barbrady go looking for men nightly."

===Jerome "Chef" McElroy===
{{main|Chef}}
In "[[Chef Aid]]", it is implied that she is not a lesbian, when she makes love to Chef, who was collecting money to pay for legal fees.

===Officer Barbrady===
{{main|Officer Barbrady}}
In "[[Starvin' Marvin]]" she acted sarcastically towards Dr. Mephesto when he explained to her about the rampaging turkeys. She was also very sarcastic to Chef when he told her about the zombie epidemic in the episode "[[Pinkeye]]".

In both episodes, in the same scenes, she was seen with Officer Barbrady, and her aides were nowhere to be found. This implies that, while she may have really been skeptical about their stories, she probably just wanted to get rid of them so she could resume being alone with Barbrady. It is implied in "[[Pinkeye]]" and "[[Summer Sucks]]" that the two of them are having sexual intercourse, as in the former episode, Barbrady is seen in women's lingerie looking out from behind the desk. Both of them looked very haggard, while the mayor is listening to Chef, and a huge pile of cash was on top of the desk. Their relationship also, apparently, had no involvement with the Japanese mafia. In "[[Summer Sucks]]", it was shown that Barbrady was performing oral sex on her, though due to his lack of intellect, he may have been doing so unwittingly.

In "[[Chickenlover]]", she heaps scorn on Officer Barbrady's inability to read, when [[Johnson]] says Officer Barbrady is an idiot, she agrees without hesitation.

In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", she and other South Park citizens (the [[City Council]]) use Officer Barbrady as their scapegoat for minorities being shot, and force him to retire twice. This episode fully depicts her cruelty, indifference and ruthlessness towards Officer Barbrady.

===Liane Cartman===
{{main|Liane Cartman}}
Mayor McDaniels has apparently had sex with [[Liane Cartman]], like many other men and women have. This is revealed at the end of "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", when the overhead speaker says "Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it [[Sheila Broflovski|Mrs. Broflovski?]] The mayor? [[Veronica Crabtree|Mrs. Crabtree]]?" Cartman rejects having this knowledge revealed, so the possibility remained for several seasons that his mother was the mayor. This was later refuted in "[[201]]", where it was revealed to be a total lie.

===Aides===
The Mayor is always followed by her two aides. They have a very similar appearance and often make plans for which McDaniels inevitably takes credit. Part of their names are both revealed in "[[Volcano]]"; one is referred to as [[Ted]], who has a mustache. The other, [[Johnson]], does not. Both of their names are taken from NFL player Ted Johnson, who used to play for New England Patriots.

In "[[Volcano]]", Mayor fires [[Johnson]] for exposing her lack of common sense. Surprisingly, Johnson accepts with pleasure, which indicates a bad relationship between him and the Mayor. In later episodes Johnson is rehired.

In "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]", Ted helps the boys to escape from the homeless people when they get too high in number, but due to a car accident, he is killed. In "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", [[Janson|another man]], in a suit similar to Johnson's, is seen with the Mayor and Johnson various times.

==Trivia==
