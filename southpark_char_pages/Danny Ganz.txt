'''Danny Ganz''' is an ATF Commander who first appear in the [[Season Three]] episode "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]".

== Background ==
Being a typical smart-ass, Danny Ganz is assertive and dumb, extremely poor at negotiating and reasoning. He persists in believing that people inside [[Mackey Residence|Mr. Mackey's house]] are religious cultists although obviously they aren't, which leads to a series of absurd actions that kill at least two innocent people. Then he tries to cover it up by calling it a simulation. He once took part in [[wikipedia:Waco Siege|the siege of Waco]].

He is also seen as a guard at [[Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall]], in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]".

==Appearance==
Danny is slightly overweight. He has short brown hair, brown mustache and a double chin. He wears a dark blue ATF uniform, black belt with gray buckle, gray pants and black shoes. He also wears a dark blue AFT hat.

==Quotes==
*''Oh don't worry, we won't let that happen, even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.''

*''Attention cult people, do not commit mass suicide. There are so many reasons not to kill yourself, flowers, for instance, and back rubs.''

==Ganz Technique==
Danny Ganz claims to have invented the Ganz Technique, which is named after him. This is how he describes it to [[Officer Barbrady]]:

"''Play really bad music really loud until it drives 'em nut and makes them want to come out.''"

The ATF indeed utilized this kind of technique in Waco, but certainly it is not invented by him.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Ganz Technique is one of Cyborg's skills. Enrages a foe within three tiles and gains yourself block for one turn. It takes one turn to cool down. Similar to [[Super Craig]]'s Hate Finger.

==Prominence==
*"[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]" - Debut
*"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]" - Seen arresting [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] with the other parents.
*"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"

==Trivia==
*Both in game and in episode, a [[Cher]]-like dance music is played when using Ganz Technique. It is a parody of Cher's 1998 song "[[Believe]]".
