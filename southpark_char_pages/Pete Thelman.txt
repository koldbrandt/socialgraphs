'''Pete Thelman''' is a third grader who first appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", where he was on the debating team with [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]]. He is not to be confused with the Goth Kids of the [[Pete Thelman (Goth)|same name]] or with [[Pete Melman]] from "[[Bass to Mouth]]".

==Background==
Pete Thelman was starting the third grade when [[The Boys|the boys]] started the fourth. In the episode "[[Fourth Grade]]", they hit him for being a "stupid third-grader". In "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", he was on the debating team with Stan and Kyle. In "[[Quest for Ratings]]", it was revealed that he urinates sitting down like a girl. Pete is also seen in "[[Raisins]]", when he is eating in the background, and in "[[Butterballs]]", where he is seen singing in Stan Marsh's [[Make Bullying Kill Itself|anti-bullying video]].

==Appearance==
Pete wears a blue, hooded jacket with dark blue hemming and a red hat with a brown puff-ball and brown trimming. He has dark brown hair and large ears. He is short in stature compared to the other children. In his earliest appearances he wore a brown shirt.
