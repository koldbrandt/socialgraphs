'''Rachel''' was a representative for Quality Curtains who made her only appearance in the [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Marjorine]]".

==Background==
When [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] returns to his house after faking his own death, his parents, [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] and [[Linda Stotch|Linda]] believe he is a demon spawn and keeps him chained up in their basement.

When Rachel sees Butters chained up in the basement, Stephen bashes her over the head with a shovel and gives Butters her corpse to feed on.

It is unknown if she was killed or knocked unconscious, though it is possible she died from her injuries later.

Rachel had long brown hair and brown eyebrows. She wore a magenta vest with an orange undershirt, a black skirt, and black shoes. She also wore pink lipstick.
