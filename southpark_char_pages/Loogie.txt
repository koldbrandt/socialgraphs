'''Loogie''' is a tooth-trading kingpin who appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]". He is a mobster with a gangster's suit.

==Background==
In "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]", he runs the local [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] tooth trading business and gets annoyed when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] muscle in on his "patch". He speaks with an accent typical to that of Mafia bosses in the media and consumes a lot of spaghetti and even gets his henchman to try to kill Kenny. He employs tons of people in his business, including [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]. Loogie's tooth trading business falls apart after he decides to join a sports team.

In "[[Professor Chaos]]", he appears as one of the candidates for [[The Boys]]' fourth friend. Although he does not have a speaking line, he does receive a rose to go on to the second round. He is referred to as 'Luigi' by Kyle.

==Appearance==
Loogie wears a black gangster's suit with a red tie, which is stereotypical of the Mafia popular culture. His hair is black and he is more physically imposing than the majority of the [[The Boys|boys]], but without the obesity present in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].

==Personality==
Loogie remains calm in most situations and possesses, or feigns, a cold and cruel personality, to the extreme of trying to murder [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. He communicates with his associates mostly through cell phones. Loogie will revert to a high-pitched voice when talking to adults, trying to hide his Mafia-like personality. It is also likely that this is his normal voice and when he is speaking on the most part, it is a put-on voice.
