'''David "Running Horse" Sawitzky''' was seen in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]".

==Background==
David was invited to give a lecture for the students of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s fourth grade class about the history between the British-European colonists and the Native Americans at the first Thanksgiving. He claimed to be 1/16th Cherokee Indian, which he believed gave him authoritative knowledge on the subject.

David arrived at [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s home, where [[the boys]] were, and was infuriated after seeing Kyle and [[Stan Marsh]] interviewed on the [[The History Channel]]. He threatened the boys with a handgun until [[Miles Standish]] burst through the door, looking for Kyle, believing Kyle was an expert on Thanksgiving from the DeVry Institute (as the History Channel claimed in subtitles during Kyle's interview with them).

The fight ended when David's claims of being Native American were tested by [[Miles Standish|Standish]]. He put a glowing ball in Sawitsky's mouth, which turned him to ashes, thus proving he was not truly of Native American heritage.

==Appearance==
Despite his claims of Native American ancestry, David Sawitzky evidently appears to be White, with light skin, slightly rosy cheeks, and blond hair. However, he still insisted on wearing a traditional Native American headdress, along with glasses, a light yellow shirt, blue jeans, and brown boots.

==Trivia==
*David's claims appear to parody both the general trope of White people who claim to have Native American ancestry, and the specific instance of [[Wikipedia:Jamake Highwater|Jamake Highwater]] — a Jewish American man named Jackie Marks who made a career off of his false claims of Native American ancestry.
