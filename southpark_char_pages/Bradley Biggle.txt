{{LinkDisambig|Bradley (Disambiguation)}}
'''Bradley Biggle''', also known as '''Mintberry Crunch''' and '''Gok'zarah''', is one of [[The Boys|the boys]]' [[The 4th Grade|classmates]]. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and first appear in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]". He is portrayed as a background character until his first major appearance in the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superheroes Saga]], beginning with "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]".

==Background==
Bradley made his first appearance in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]" as part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, along with [[Kelly ("Rainforest Schmainforest")|Kelly]], [[Jake]], [[Esther]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Millie Larsen]], [[Sally Turner|Sally]], a nameless black-haired boy, and two unnamed brunette girls. He later becomes a recurring background character in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]". Bradley's first speaking role was in "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", where he sings "I can make a Mr. Hankey, too!" before pooping out [[Mr. Hankey]] from behind a bush.

During "[[Fourth Grade]]", he begins appearing in the classroom and since has remained a part of the recurring fourth-grade classroom with some omissions. He later appeared in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]" as one of the boys who reverted to an apeman-like state when attracted to [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] due to her developing boobs. He was partnered with Esther in "[[Follow That Egg!]]" for the class project, was ranked #4 on the list of cutest boys in "[[The List]]" and played on the school's basketball team in "[[Elementary School Musical]]".

He made his first significant appearance in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" as the superhero [[Mintberry Crunch]] with his role continuing through the story arc's second part, "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and he appears in the arc's conclusion, "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" where he plays a crucial role. During the first two episodes, he is unable to say exactly what his power is - this was first brought up by [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]], who suggested that he add something to the costume; Bradley said "Milk?". He is left behind to "guard the base" when the others go to the hotel fire. Eventually, when everyone follows the disgraced Coon outside where [[Cthulhu]], who had risen and sided with the Coon over the course of the story, is waiting for them, he runs away and escapes exile to the Sunken City of R'Lyeh. [[Mysterion]] uses his power to escape, and Bradley follows Mysterion to where Cthulhu is massacring a [[Justin Bieber]] concert. A message then arrives from space for "Gok'Zarah", who turns out to be Bradley - it informs him that he, too, has a power and was sent to Earth as a result of his parents being missing. Bradley uses his newfound powers, over Mint and Berry, to defeat Cthulhu, close the rift between Earth and R'Lyeh, and incarcerate Cartman. He then leaves to track down his parents. However, in the beginning of the story none of the other Coon friends believed he had a superpower, and the revelation of his powers surprised everyone. Also, Bradley's last name was revealed in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" to be Biggle. Since then, he only made a few cameo appearances, all of them with his normal identity.

==Appearance==
He is an alien who wears a human disguise with pale skin and blonde, bowl-cut hair, with a cow-lick sticking up at the back of his head. He also wears a navy blue sweater with red mittens and blue jeans.
{{GallerySubPage|name=Bradley Biggle}}

==Personality==
Bradley seems to be bright and very active. He has his major appearances in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]". Until then, though, he usually only appeared as a background character. Bradley is the true identity of Mintberry Crunch, later identified as Gok'Zarah. As Mintberry Crunch, he was bullied by [[Eric Cartman|The Coon]] until he discovered his power, whereupon he put the Coon in a dog crate with [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]. While he has had occasional speaking roles, he never really spoke until the Coon and Friends episodes.

Bradley also appears to possess a kind heart as can be seen in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" where he tried to stop Coon from beating Mosquito and ended up getting scratched. Another example can be seen in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" where Bradley is the only one who tried to stop [[Mysterion]] from provoking Cthulhu and sacrificing himself in exchange for their friends.

==Family==
Bradley was apparently adopted by the Biggles. However, he is actually an alien sent to Earth by his birth parents after the collision of the Mint and Berry worlds. Little is known about his real family other than their home planet's name was [[Kokujon]].

===[[Harriet Biggle]]===
Bradley's mother has been shown to be very nice and caring for her children. It is unknown how or when she took Bradley in as her own child but this factor does not seem to cause any difficulties in their relationship. She tries to get her children to get along by asking her daughter Henrietta to spend some time with her brother, it seems that she is oblivious to Henrietta's disdain towards Bradley.

===[[Henrietta Biggle]]===
The relationship between Bradley and Henrietta is rocky to say the least. Henrietta finds her little brother to be an annoying twerp and Bradley, in return, is scared of her. Despite relying on her at times to keep him company, Bradley would like to gain the upper hand on his sister and he eventually did when he rubbed her face in it after discovering his powers. He returned to their home only to call her fat and flip her off, suggesting an utter dislike for her.

===[[Kokujon Man|Biological Father]]===
[[File:Bradly's Father.jpg|thumb|Bradley's real father.]]
Little is known about his birth father. However, when things got too dangerous for his son, an image of him appeared before Bradley to tell him about his origins (the planet K'oh Kajan) and powers. His appearance seems to be based on the singer Limahl, who was most famous for singing the theme to the 1984 movie adaptation of ''The NeverEnding Story''.

===Other===
Bradley's sister Henrietta talked about her father and aunt when she was first introduced. From her description, we hear that Bradley's adopted father is an alcoholic and his aunt is a drug addict. This however may not be true as Henrietta seems to over-exaggerate or make false claims about her loved ones because she likes to see things negatively.

Bradley's alien father also states that his son also had an alien mother, however it is unknown what happened to her or if she is still alive.

==Interactions==
===[[Eric Cartman]]===
Bradley often follows Cartman's schemes, such as capturing Kyle in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]". In the Coon and Friends episodes, Bradley annoys Cartman, who bullies Bradley in response, because of his Mintberry Costume. Cartman got annoyed of him saying phrases such as, "Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor!" Bradley is also scared of Cartman because he can easily beat him up; he got beaten up by Cartman in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" when they were going to the grocery store. But in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", at the end of the episode, Bradley defeated [[Cthulhu]] and put [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] in the same prison where [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] was incarcerated throughout the trilogy. He also realizes he has his own powers of Mint and Berry whenever he says "Shabalogoo!" In the beginning, Cartman did not seem to understand his powers either.

===[[Esther]]===
Bradley and Esther were paired up in "[[Follow That Egg!]]". Bradley and Esther were also part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]". It also seems that they could also be seen together in the background so it is possible that he and Esther are either a couple or very close friends.

A picture of Esther can be found in Bradley's room in the video game, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', implying he has a possible romantic interest in her.

==Powers and Abilities==
Bradley transforms into [[Mintberry Crunch]] by spinning around and invoking the magic word ''Shablagoo!! ''When asked by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] what his powers were, he replied: "The power of mint and berries, with a satisfying, tasty crunch!!" He is later shown able to shower enemies with berries as well as mint. His other powers include flight, super-human strength to the point of easily dragging [[Cthulhu]] by a tentacle, generating a berry force field, and teleporting in a splash of berries.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", Bradley's voice was done by Jesse Howell, who had voiced [[Ike Broflovski]] throughout the first three seasons. Years later, in "[[Marjorine]]", Bradley is given a nasally voice akin to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], voiced by [[Matt Stone]]. This same voice carries over into the episodes "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]".
