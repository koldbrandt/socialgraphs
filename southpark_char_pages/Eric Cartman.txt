{{Featured Winner|October 2007}}
'''Eric Theodore Cartman''', usually referred to as just '''Cartman''', is one of the main characters, along with [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an episode, for example "[[Trapper Keeper]]". None of the other three main children really consider Cartman their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, but a certain form of unstable friendship ends up being born between them. However he is usually Kyle's first choice when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend, however, in later seasons, [[Butters Stotch]] is usually depicted as such.

Cartman was the first one of [[The Boys|the boys]] to be shown without his hat, as seen in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]". He also weighs 90 pounds, as revealed in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]".

==Background==
===Concept and Creation===
According to the creators, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], they thought it would be impossible to put a character like [[wikipedia: Archie Bunker|Archie Bunker]] on late-20th century television. But then they came up with the idea that it might be allowed if the character were an animated nine (formerly eight) year-old boy living in the mountain town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park, Colorado]]. Thus, Cartman was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/matt-stone-and-trey-parker-with-larry-divney|title=Matt Stone and Trey Parker with Larry Divney|date=March 1, 2002|publisher=firstamendmentcenter.org}}</ref>

Contrary to popular belief that Cartman's name was derived from German war-pilot Erich Hartmann (which would reflect his love of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the Nazis), Cartman's name and personality are based on Matt Karpman, a friend of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408072434/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=11264|title=South Park Studios FAQ|date=January 28, 2003|publisher=web.archive.org}}</ref> Karpman was known for being slightly overweight, short, very obnoxious and skilled with his verbal comebacks. According to their mutual friend Jonathan Korty, Trey came up with the name Cartman during a Super Bowl party on 29 January 1995. [[The Spirit of Christmas|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Frosty]] had been completed back in 1992 and "The Fat Kid" needed a name. Trey was sitting in a corner quietly watching Karpman and their other friends trash talk during the game when one person said, "Shut up Karpman". Trey suddenly blurted out, "Cartman! That’s the perfect name for The Fat Kid." Karpman's retorts against that further convinced Trey that "The Fat Kid" had to be named Cartman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cart.mn/karpman|title=Karpman Family Fundraiser}}</ref>

Trey Parker and Matt Stone have repeatedly stated that Cartman is their ultimate favorite of all the characters in the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695|title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&*%|date=April 5, 2008|publisher=npr.org}}</ref> Although Cartman is initially modeled after Archie Bunker, Toni Johnson-Woods, author of ''Blame Canada: South Park and Contemporary Culture'', says that she believes Cartman also draws parallels to Jackie Gleason of ''[[wikipedia:The Honeymooners|The Honeymooners]]'', and [[wikipedia:Fred Flintstone|Fred Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695|title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&*%|date=April 5, 2008|publisher=npr.org}}</ref>

===Accomplishments===
Over the course of the series, Cartman managed to accomplish a wide range of achievements more than any other character of ''[[South Park]]''. Some of them are a success or failure:
*"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]" - Wins the [[Cheesy Poofs]] singing commercial contest. However, he only got one line ("Lame") in the commercial. (Successful/Failure)
*"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]" - Tries to win a bet over [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]], so that they have to be his slaves for a month. Failure, although he did manage to manipulate an entire army of drunken Confederate Civil War actors to almost split apart the US, and never got punished in any way for it (Failure).
*"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]" - Proves himself that he is "mature" and becomes [[NAMBLA]]'s poster-child, unaware they were pedophiles and only interested on account of his youth. (Successful/Failure)
*"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" - Had [[Scott Tenorman]]'s parents killed, grounded them up into chili, and fed it to their son. (Success, and Failure seeing as he kills [[Jack Tenorman|his biological father]] doing this but that did not seem to bother him when he found out)
*"[[Cartmanland]]" - Bought the theme park with one million dollars he inherited from his grandmother. After selling it back to the original owner, he blew all his money. (Failure)
*"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]" - Proved to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that it is possible to defecate out of the mouth after putting food up the anus. (Successful Failure, although he proved to Kyle that his theory worked, Kyle congratulated Cartman which ruined his true intentions: Humiliating Kyle by flaunting the money he lost.)
*"[[Christian Rock Hard]]" - Forms [[Faith + 1|a band]] to make a platinum album, but only gets "myrrh". (Failure)
*"[[The Passion of the Jew]]" - Attempts to start a second Holocaust. But, succeeds in tricking a big crowd to his side for a while. (Successful Failure)
*"[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]" - Bets Kyle that when you die you release your bowels. (Success)
*"[[Imaginationland]]" - Wins a bet with Kyle, which requires Kyle to "suck his balls". He later conjured up an imaginary Kyle, who sucked an imaginary Cartman's balls. Because Kyle said all things imaginary are real, this can be considered a success. (Success)
*"[[Poor and Stupid]]" - Became a NASCAR racer and win the NASCAR race (Failure)
*"[[Mysterion Rises]]" - Became a complete but extremely delusional villain starting by controlling [[Cthulhu]] with his "cute and cuddly" methods and attacks many people and things, starting with [[hippies]], the Jewish Synagogue, and [[San Francisco]]. (Success)
*"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" - Had [[Cthulhu]] destroy the hippie concert of Burning Man, eliminate every single [[Whole Foods Market]], send [[Coon and Friends]] to a dark oblivion, murder [[Justin Bieber]], and do more evil. (Success/Failure)
*"[[1%]]"- Matured slightly by having an extremely delusional episode, which resulted in him "murdering" his stuffed animals. (Success)
*"[[You're Not Yelping]]"- Pretended to be a food critic to get free food. (Success)

===Criminal Record===
Cartman is notable for having a very large criminal record. Although he has committed many atrocities and crimes, he has only been arrested seven times. He has been arrested for his mistakenly assumed hate crime, kidnapping Butters, framing [[Liane]] for operating a meth lab, being with Stan Marsh on "[[Whale Whores]]" (The prison Cartman went to for this assumed crime was Japanese), and incarcerating hippies. In "[[Time To Get Cereal]]" he, along with Kyle, Stan and Kenny, was arrested by [[Harrison Yates]] for assumed school shootings, which have been proven to be [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]'s attacks. He was also arrested for the murders and terrorism of multiple people with Cthulhu, while under the disguise of the Coon, by Kyle, Kenny, Stan, [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], Token and [[Timmy]], although they did not have the authority. Even then he was released almost immediately after his arrest. The real reason why Cartman does not stay in prison for a very long time is likely because his Mom bails him out, dismissing the severity of the crime. Another reason why because the town is too incompetent to do anything about it. Cartman's criminal record includes but is not limited to:
*'''Murder''': In "[[Butt Out]]", Cartman stabbed [[Rob Reiner]], essentially killing him. This can be considered self defense; Reiner had been trying to lynch him by gathering a mob. However, Rob Reiner does appear in a later episode proving he did not actually die. When he flash-backed to 1776 in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]", he brutally murdered a messenger boy with a log, although this was in his imagination, and therefore was not a real crime. He was also indirectly responsible for the murder of Mr. and [[Mrs. Tenorman]] in "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", and many others in "[[Poor and Stupid]]". He shot and killed two members of the Chinese Mafia in "[[Wing]]" but that was in self-defense. He murdered dozens of people while they were zombies and he did not have to do that as all he had to do was kill Kenny. He also electrocuted several Mexicans to death with a taser after soaking them in water in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]".
*'''Prostitution''': After Kyle caused him to have a severe concussion and amnesia in "[[Cow Days]]", he begins to think that he was a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Lee and it is implied that he prostituted himself to [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. He also did this in "[[Chickenlover]]" and "[[Freak Strike]]" but he did not have sex with anyone but actually pretended to be a prostitute.
*'''Vandalism''': He mentions in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]" that he had broken a man's fence without telling him about it. He also destroyed most of the stuff in Butters' room with a baseball bat in the same episode. He even did this in "[[AWESOM-O]]" when he messed up the entire Stotch house while trying to find a videotape Butters had. He T-p'ed a house in "[[Toilet Paper]]" and "[[The Ring]]" and since Butters was put in jail for it Cartman would have but he was praised instead for being honest.
*'''Manslaughter''': He accidentally bashed Kenny's skull in "[[Timmy 2000]]" with a frying pan while trying to hit a bug on his face. Though it was the [[Ritalin]] side effects and a hallucination, he did not mean to legitimately murder Kenny. When he tried to kill [[Gobbles|Timmy's turkey]] with a stagelight in [[Helen Keller! The Musical]], it accidentally killed Kenny instead due to the fact that he rigged the wrong one.
*'''Murder By Proxy''': In "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", although he did not directly murder Scott's parents, he did know that the situation he was putting them in would get them killed. He also conspired with Kenny to have [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] murdered in "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", resulting in her getting shot. He also tries multiple times to convince the others to kill Kyle. In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", although Cartman does not directly murder anyone, he does manipulate [[Cthulhu]] in murdering hundreds of people whom he personally deems evil, which includes Hippies, Jews, the people of [[San Francisco]], and [[Justin Bieber]]. In "[[Funnybot]]", Cartman uses his German language skills, by talking into the Germans to kill Kyle, but this attempt failed. He even attempted to do this in "[[Tsst]]" when he kidnapped a student named [[Billy Turner]] and forced him to play a [[wikipedia:Saw (franchise)|jigsaw]] game by handcuffing his ankle to the school flagpole. Cartman secretly spiked poison in Billy's lunch milk and told him that the poison would kill him unless he sawed off his own leg and got the antidote.
*'''Enforced Suicide''': In "[[T.M.I.]]", Cartman was put in an anger management group and while there, he used his iPhone to send a series of text messages to the wife of the doctor who was trying to get a reaction out of him. These text messages placed the doctor's wife in a very bad position because in these text messages, Cartman was forcing the doctor's wife to commit suicide, in which she does so. It is unknown how he got the phone number of the doctor as he required one in order to make a text. He banished Kenny, Stan, Kyle, Timmy, Clyde, and [[Token]] to a "dark oblivion", in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]" in which Kenny was forced to get himself impaled on a spike under a cliff in order to save his friends. He does this again in "[[Bass to Mouth]]" when he tricks [[Jenny Simons]] into eating a cupcake Cartman secretly spiked a strong laxative into. He causes Jenny to crap her pants in class and as a result she attempts suicide. The suicide fails and she survives but in the process she suffers a fractured pelvis and had to be taken to the hospital. He even did it before Jenny's accident when he caused one student to crap his pants so much that he needed new clothes from his mother therefore exposing him to the [[Eavesdropper]] website and made him think on suicide but in the end he decided not to. A year before the "[[Bass to Mouth]]" Cartman caused the first incident of a student crapping his pants and then made a hazing ritual out of it, causing the kid to kill himself.
*'''Animal Abuse''': In various episodes, Cartman abuses [[Mr. Kitty]] whenever the cat attempts to get some of his food. In addition, it was noted in "[[Douche and Turd]]" that Cartman broke [[Kenny McCormick]]'s pet cat's leg. He also smacks [[Fluffy]] in "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]" after the pig wakes him up.
*'''Attempted Murder''': He attempted to kill [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], & [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in "[[Toilet Paper]]" using a wiffle bat, not comprehending the stupidity of the plan. He also attempted to fire on the President of FOX in [[Cartoon Wars Part II]], without realizing his gun was not loaded. In "[[Tsst]]" he conspired to kill his own mother because he felt oppressed by her after she hired the Dog Whisperer [[Cesar Millan]] to deal with Cartman's spoiled and bratty behavior. He also attempted to murder [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]" in order to prevent him from crossing the U.S-Mexican border.
*'''Attempted Genocide''': In "[[The Passion of the Jew]]" he tries to exterminate the Jews, and in "[[Ginger Kids]]" he tries to get people to wipe out the Gingers. When he becomes one, he instead plans to kill all non-Gingers, not wanting to live out his whole life as a minority. In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", Cartman along with [[Cthulhu]] attempt to wipe out the Jews by attacking assorted Jewish Temples.
*'''Enforced Cannibalism''': In "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" Cartman tricks [[Farmer Carl Denkins|a farmer]] into killing Scott Tenorman's parents. Then Cartman takes the corpses and grounds them up into Chili so he could serve it to Scott Tenorman in the Chili Con Carne Festival. Cartman does so and therefore tricks Scott Tenorman into cannibalism. In "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", Cartman mistook Kenny's ashes for chocolate milk mix and drinks him, and eventually became possessed by his soul.
*'''Assault''': Done several times, although many of these are not crimes, but in fact just fighting with friends. He beats up Jimmy in "[[Casa Bonita]]" when Jimmy is not expecting it and, considering he is handicapped, it could be a crime. In "[[The Coon]]", he also attacks a man and woman with the claws on his hands, scratching the man's face up and causing the woman to run away in terror (he thought the woman was being raped). In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" Cartman brutally assaults [[Bradley Biggle|Mintberry Crunch]] and Mosquito with the metal claws on his hands for absolutely no reason at all. Cartman does this again in "[[Mysterion Rises]]" when he beats up a little girl in an airport after she asked him what Mintberry Crunch was like. He attacks [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]] and Token with a rock causing to have their arms broken which is mild assault, but Cartman gets arrested for a hate crime instead.
*'''Smuggling''': He became the leader of a fried chicken cartel in "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]". However this does not count as a crime because the [[KFC]] was not really outlawed and really had some of the restaurants shut down.
*'''Drug Possession''': In "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]", Cartman gave some crack to the babies that were diagnosed with fetal cocaine syndrome and then videotaped them playing with the bag of crack and put it on the internet. He also gave crack to a women who was addicted to cocaine and was pregnant with her child. The crack he possessed may had come from his mother and she was seen smoking it after having sex with two men in "[[Jakovasaurs]]"
*'''Theft/Obstruction of Criminal Investigation''': Cartman stole the dead bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman off a crime scene while [[Barbrady]] was investigating. It is also mentioned in "[[About Last Night...]]", where Cartman had stolen everyone's televisions while they were out getting drunk on the streets.
*'''Armed Robbery''': in "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", Cartman gets Kyle into a stickup. Cartman was pointing a gun at Kyle and demanded that Kyle give his [[Jew Gold]] to Cartman. Kyle gives Cartman a bag of rocks first and then presumably throws another fake bag into the fire. In "[[Go God Go XII]]", he robs two kids of their [[Crank Prank Time Phone]] with a laser gun which was presumably expensive.
*'''Violation of Firearm Laws/Threatening with a deadly weapon''': The Glock pistol that Cartman carries is almost certainly illegal and unregistered. Although it is never explained where he obtained the gun, it is likely he obtained during the events of "[[Wing]]" (the glock is the same gun he used to fight off the Chinese Triads during said episode). He constantly uses it to threaten people such as Kyle and the President of FOX in "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]". He also stole a taser from his mom in order to defend himself from [[Trent Boyett]] in "[[Pre-School]]"
*'''Arson''': In "[[Pre-School]]", Cartman and the boys tricked Trent Boyett into starting a fire, in which the boys believed they were able to put out with their own urine but were unable to. In "[[Butt Out]]", Cartman and the boys were smoking outside school and threw their cigarettes away to avoid being caught by [[Mr. Mackey]], but the cigarettes landed near the school and accidentally set it on fire. However, all of these arson's were accidental and unintentional. He did it again in "[[1%]]" but he committed this arson in his very own room. He was told to grow up so he ended up dividing his personality into all of his stuffed animals and then getting rid of the stuffed animals through brutal and weird ways. He did not mean to set his own room on fire and might had been sleepwalking when he did it. He caused the fire in order to get rid of [[Peter Panda]].
*'''Graverobbing''': in "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]", Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny unearthed [[Cleo Broflovski|Kyle's dead grandma]] from a cemetery and planned to use it to scare the living daylights off a couple of [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]]. This brought up false rumors about some of the people in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] having sex with corpses and brought the pirate ghost hysteria to a whole new level.
*'''Hate Crimes''': He bashed Token's head with a rock in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", although he was later proven not to have done this to Token for racial reasons, and therefore was released from jail almost immediately after his arrest, but it still counts as a mild case of assault. However, his attempts against Jews, Hippies, Gingers, and non-Gingers while he thought he was one may count, as his motivations are specifically because they are members of this group. His actions with Cthulhu against Jews, Hippies, the people of San Francisco during the events of "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", Cartman along with [[Cthulhu]] perform numerous terrorist actions against assorted groups, cities and individuals could also be considered hate crimes.
*'''Kidnapping and false imprisonment''': He locked Butters in a bomb shelter for three days in "[[Casa Bonita]]" and kidnapped 63 hippies and trapped them in his basement in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]". He also held the Hakeems prisoner in "[[The Snuke]]" (though this was government-sanctioned.) and he took Butters from the mental hospital without permission from officials in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]".
*'''Unlicensed Surgery''': In "[[Jared Has Aides]]"''', '''he, Stan, and Kyle performed unlicensed liposuction on Butters with a hose in order to get him thinner in hopes of getting money from a weight loss scam. They even framed Butters by simply running away and hiding, causing yet another grounding for Butters from his parents.
*'''Terrorism''': Cartman admits to this when he is trying to get ''[[Family Guy]]'' pulled, both through threats from Islamic bombers and through threatening the FOX President with a hand gun. He also formed an anti-Chinese organization with Butters in "[[The China Probrem]]", and held an entire building full of hostages on the gun point, with Butters wounding 2 police officers and a civilian with badly aimed gunshots. His attempt to split up the U.S. through manipulating a drunken army of southerners to plunder towns and march on D.C. might also count, although this was not for political reasons so much as it was for making Stan and Kyle his slaves. In "[[The Coon]]" he tries to bomb a hospital to lure out [[Mysterion]] by planting dynamite on it. He managed to set the explosives, but ditched the plot and decided helping Mysterion would be more preferable. In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", Cartman along with [[Cthulhu]] perform numerous terrorist actions against assorted groups, cities and individuals. He also participated with his anger management classmates and [[Randy Marsh]] in "[[T.M.I.]]" in terrorizing a Fed-Ex building and threatened to not release the hostages until their demands were met.
*'''War Crimes''': The Drunken Southern Civil War army he led is seen looting, pillaging, attacking civilians, and burning down buildings. It is also implied by Cartman at one point his troops are raping women (When he offers Kenny a spot in his army he says: "Join me, and you shall have many plunders and women!", although he does not specifically reference rape). He also employed at least two other child soldiers, Kenny and Butters.
*'''Medical Terrorism''': In "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", Cartman sneaks into Kyle's room, draws the HIV contaminated blood from himself, and squirts it into Kyle's mouth, giving him HIV in the process. This is medical terrorism because Cartman intentionally makes someone critically ill in order to satisfy a desire for revenge. The motive for this was that Kyle was laughing at Cartman in disbelief after hearing that his arch-nemesis received a deadly virus that would kill him within less than a decade. Cartman thought that Kyle was being insensitive and gave him the HIV virus so he would not laugh at Cartman anymore.
*'''Violation and Obstruction of the Pure Food and Drug Act:''' In "[[Ass Burgers]]", Cartman pretends he has [[Asperger's Syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]] by placing multiple hamburgers in his butt. He gave one to Kyle who liked the burgers a lot. Cartman then started a hamburger business in which he placed multiple hamburgers up his butt to give them the taste Kyle loved. He was later found out about this and his business was forced to shut down. This violates the Pure Food and Drug Act because Cartman put hamburgers up his butt and the sold them to customers. Since the burgers were up his butt, they were contaminated and might had some bacteria and E Coli in them, which is known to make people very sick. Some of the kids who ate the burgers might have gotten sick and some customers might have died from E coli. He does this again thrice in "[[Bass to Mouth]]" when he spiked laxatives into several cupcakes and tricked several students into eating them. He even does this in the same episode when he made the school faculty spike laxatives and horseradish into pizza in order to make the entire school crap their pants. He also did this to Mr. Mackey in the hallway and made him crap his pants and fart his whole body across the hallway.
*'''Piracy''': In "[[Fatbeard]]", he assembled several groups of Somalian pirates to plunder ships in increasingly aggressive ways, until all his pirates are shot to death by U.S. snipers. This crime in his criminal record is ignored by the government because they thought that Cartman was a hostage of the pirates due to his skin color.
*'''Breaking and Entering''': In "[[Tonsil Trouble]]" and "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", he broke into Kyle's room. The purpose for this was to steal one of the 3 triangles of Zinthar and give Kyle HIV. He also broke into the veal ranch in "[[Fun with Veal]]". Cartman also broke into several houses in " [[About Last Night...|About Last Night ...]] ", in order to steal televisions.
*'''Credit Fraud and Identity Theft''': In "[[Fatbeard]]" Cartman steals his mother's credit card and uses it to buy plane tickets to Cairo for himself, Clyde, Butters, [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]]. He also uses her Visa card to rent an [[E-Scooter]] in "[[The Scoots]]".
*'''Embezzlement''': In "[[Probably]]", Cartman starts his own church after he and the kids catch [[Father Maxi]] having sex in the church confessional with Clyde Donovan's aunt. Cartman made every kid in South Park into evangelists and asked for their money for charity. However, in reality, he was taking full advantage of them because he was actually taking all their money and was spending all of the supposed church money on himself. Therefore, it counts as embezzlement.
*'''Underage Driving/Hit and Run''': In "[[Poor and Stupid]]", Eric Cartman hijacked a race car and ran over several spectators and pit crew members, culminating in the deaths of eleven people. He later does this again, going off the race track and into a trailer campsite, presumably killing many people. In addition to all this, he purposely ran over another driver, Danica Patrick, on purpose after she was eliminated from the race.
*'''Resisting Arrest''': In "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", Cartman escapes from custody after being found guilty of committing a presumed hate crime. Cartman bribes Kenny to drive him to Mexico in his battery operated kiddie car and therefore puts the police in a wild goose chase with it ending near the U.S/Mexico borderline. He does this again in "[[Casa Bonita]]" when Sheila and the boys found out that Cartman selfishly kidnapped Butters and locked him in a bomb shelter, therefore scaring all of South Park so Cartman could go to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] for Kyle's 9th birthday. When Sheila says that the police were on their way to arrest Cartman for the kidnapping of Leopold "Butters" Stotch, Cartman runs into the restaurant and tries to avoid the police as much as he can while enjoying what Casa Bonita has to offer in the process. The chase therefore ends after Cartman tries one last ditch effort to resist arrest by jumping into a 20-foot waterfall only to get cornered and arrested.
*'''Child Abuse''': In "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]", Cartman made some babies diagnosed with fetal cocaine syndrome play a game of basketball with a bag of coke and videotaped it. This counts as child abuse, because Cartman was making a profit out of this and did not give the babies any credit, which counts as slave labor.
*'''Shoplifting''': In "[[Poor and Stupid]]", Cartman goes to a local grocery store with Butters in hopes of finding Vagisil there. While in the store, Butters forgets to bring money with him to buy the [[Vagisil]] because Cartman did not tell him to. Cartman then decides to ingest multiple Vagisil products in the store and then leaves without paying for the Vagisil.
*'''Blackmailing, Framing, False Evidence''': In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", Cartman (a.k.a. [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]) tries to blackmail [[Captain Hindsight]], in order to have him join the superhero team. He also framed Trent Boyett twice in "[[Pre-School]]" for arson and the assault of a teacher in order to get out of trouble and avoid his wrath for five years. He also commits blackmail in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]" when he pressured Kyle into seeing the Passion Of the Christ and told him to have the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. However, this kind of blackmail was emotional blackmail because Cartman did not threaten Kyle with extortion or with a videotape or photos. Another example of his blackmailing is shown in "[[Cancelled]]" when the Joozian producers were caught having weird alien sex (They were sucking each other's jagons while high on alien drugs) in front of him and the other boys. Kenny takes a picture of the Joozian's doing this and Cartman takes advantage of this by using it as blackmail. However, this crime may not count because Cartman broke this law in another planet and was doing this in order to save Earth from being destroyed. Unfortunately, Cartman may be held accountable for this in the Intergalactic Justice system because he broke this law on another planet and may be an example of extradition. However, again, Cartman got his memory erased and could not remember anything about this blackmail at all. Also, in "[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]", some people who had supernatural powers accused Cartman and his false ability of being a fraud and sued him. In order to avoid the lawsuit, Cartman intentionally framed this group of people for the murder of [[Veronica Crabtree]] and it caused the group to get arrested with one of their members killed by police. He even framed his mother in "[[The Poor Kid]]" after he found out that his family has the second lowest income in South Park. He engineered a plan to get himself into a foster home by creating a meth lab in his backyard and framing his mom for it, therefore getting her arrested. The police however found out about this later and arrested Cartman and placed him in jail for two months
*'''Torture''': In "[[The Snuke]]", he used farts to torture the Hakeem family. However this does not count as actual torture because Cartman does not use any weapons but rather his own gas to annoy and provoke the Hakeem Family. What Cartman did to the Hakeem family was actually government sponsored and therefore is not branded into his criminal record. Unfortunately, in "[[Tsst]]", Cartman kidnapped a student named Billy Turner and forced him to play a Jigsaw game. Cartman secretly spiked poison into Billy's lunch milk and handcuffed him to a school flagpole. Then, Cartman forced Billy to torture himself by cutting off his own leg in order to get the antidote.
*'''Fraud'''/'''Plagiarism''': In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", he replaces the words 'Baby' in love songs with 'Jesus', which is plagiarism, and fraudulent as the band is not technically Christian rock. He also pretends to be mentally disabled twice in "[[Le Petit Tourette]]" and in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]". He also does this in "[[Freak Strike]]" when Cartman decides to go on the [[Maury Povich]] show and pretend to be an out of control teenage prostitute for the sole purpose of obtaining a valuable prize after Butters unintentionally scams him of one by appearing on the same show as a practical joke by the boys and with fake testicles attached to his chin.
*'''Rape''': In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", he gave Butters a blowjob (technically) without his knowledge, and puts Butters' penis in his mouth. It is also implied that he and his men raped women in "[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]" and "[[Fatbeard]]", but this is not proven.
*'''Forceful Confinement: '''During the events of "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", he (as 'The Coon') forces Butters to stay in a small jail cell in his basement. He also locked away 63 hippies in his basement in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]".
*'''Contempt of Court''': In "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]", Cartman sues Stan for Sexual Harassment and then took full advantage of him in court. However, in this crime, Cartman was being used by Kyle's father Gerald Broflovski so he could make money by telling Cartman to sue [[South Park Elementary]] too.
*'''Vigilantism''': Due to Cartman's attempts at crime fighting in "[[The Coon]]" and his violent methods of dealing with crime, he is technically in violation of the law regarding vigilante actions. However, due to his constant ineffectual attempts, this is overlooked by South Park Authorities.
*'''Submitting False Evidence''': In "[[Dances with Smurfs]]", Cartman uses the lie he made about [[Wendy Testaburger]] killing all of the Smurfs as the key plot device for his movie. He then uses the movie to frame Wendy by poorly dressing up as her and then doing the same thing he claimed that Wendy did. Not only did he provide a sneak peek for all of the students of South Park Elementary to see on his morning show, but he also released it on DVD and Blu-Ray to stores all across America. This lawbreaking led to the creation of the movie ''Avatar''.
*'''Slander''': In "[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]", Cartman declared not only in general, but on national TV that his own mother Liane has "fucked him", all because she refused to let him have an iPad. While he is speaking figuratively, the audience and [[Dr. Phil]] assume him to mean it literally. In a slightly less liable manner, Cartman also slandered Wendy in "[[Dances with Smurfs]]", he accuses her of being a slut, embezzling money from the school, genocide of the Smurfs and numerous other atrocities, but escapes legal liability by adding "allegedly" at the end. He also does this in "[[The Snuke]]" when he told the CIA that the Hakeem Family were a group of terrorists. However, this lie serves a very good purpose because Cartman ended up stopping the British from invading America because of that lie.
*'''Hitchhiking''': In '[[Imaginationland]]", Cartman hitchhikes to Washington D.C to get Kyle to suck his balls, but in the State of Colorado, hitchhikers can face up to two years in prison.
*'''Theft''': In "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", when the boys are building the ladder to Heaven, Cartman steals a seat from [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s car. Cartman mentions that Mr. Garrison did not throw away his car, so he obviously did not do it with permission.
*'''Child Pornography''': In "[[Safe Space]]" he tells Kyle, he has taken and published photo of his penis on the intenet.

===Talents===

====Manipulation and Leadership Ability====
[[File:GingerKids (66).png|thumb|Cartman as a Ginger kid in "[[Ginger Kids]]".]]
''"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman!"'' -Kyle, upon seeing Cartman manipulate the gingers into doing the opposite of what he had previously told them to do in "Ginger Kids"

''"Yes, but at least I'm not going to die!"'' - In which Cartman, for once, agrees with Kyle, as he admits that he is manipulative, because that is likely what he does in almost every episode.

Cartman is often shown to be a poor student, but excels in leadership and team organization which usually involves exploitation of others' weaknesses. Although having his origins as a secondary role as the comic foil, Cartman has evolved into a character of stunningly articulate manipulative talents and techniques. His abilities are deeply Machiavellian in nature, and his character follows closely in the footsteps of other famous manipulators such as the character Iago from William Shakespeare's ''Othello''. In several episodes throughout the series, he employs this skill to get what he wants. His most frequent targets are adults and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], though he often targets other children for more personal purposes, including convincing Butters to "take one for the team" and be anally gang-raped by men from [[NAMBLA]] in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", and repeatedly convincing Kyle that he is doing good, only to exploit Kyle's help later on. He talked the ginger kids out of killing all non-gingers after Kyle told him that they had played a trick on him in "[[Ginger Kids]]". Earlier in that episode, he had rallied all the gingers into a genocidal frenzy, convincing them that all non-gingers are inferior in a Hitler or KKK-esque way, as well as stage violent protests and march down the streets chanting "red power!". He then made them kidnap all the children in town and hold them in a cage over a pit of lava, but managed to convince them to stop when he was told by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that his case of "[[Gingervitus]]" was a prank. Along the same line, in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]", he is able to rally all the members of the [[Mel Gibson]] fan club to march through the town while yelling, "''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!''" (We must exterminate the Jews!). However, it should probably be noted that they were ignorant of the true meaning of this phrase, mistaking it for Aramaic. But given the fact that it caused a large argument in the middle of the city between his group and some Jews, and given the violent and ignorant nature of most adults in South Park, it would not be surprising if it had turned into violence if allowed to continue. Cartman was also shown smiling in the background at the argument, as if all was according to his plan. He also demonstrates great understanding of the human mind and the way to exploit it. In the episode "[[Tsst]]", Cartman was able to drive several nannies from his house with insults and insinuation (even causing one to be put in a mental hospital). In the same episode, he also made one child saw his own leg off in a reference to the movie "Saw".

Cartman is a good strategist, organizer and speaker. He devises elaborate plans to achieve his goals, sometimes presenting them to his friends using a whiteboard. In "[[The List]]", he comes up with [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail|a plan]] (and later [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time|a second]]) to get the [[The List/Trivia#The "Fake" List|girls' list]] into the boys' possession. In "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", when everyone else gives up playing [[World of Warcraft]], he devises a plan to defeat '[[Jenkins|the griefer]]' and successfully motivates the other boys to join him. In "[[Fatbeard]]", growing sick of school, he devises a plan to go to [[Somalia]] to become a pirate. He successfully convinces [[Pirate Club|a group of friends]] to join him and leads the "expedition".

Cartman's perceived stupidity by his friends can be attributed to his sometimes naive, careless behavior. However, his uncanny skill at manipulation, bilingualism, and ability to create elaborate schemes which are often effective imply a high intellect, despite his ignorance. Cartman seems to have no problem talking to people and speaking in general. He has an uncanny way with words and uses that to his advantage whenever he plots an idea. For example, in "[[Kenny Dies]]", Cartman delivers a speech to the United States House of Representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research. He also appears to be multilingual (though not very well).

He claims to be able to speak Spanish in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", when he tells a [[Costa Rica]]n freedom fighter that he wants burritos, and in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", he actually speaks Spanish to the Mexican workers hired to smear Butters home with excrement. In "[[D-Yikes!]]", Cartman again demonstrates his proficiency in Spanish when hiring Mexicans to write an "essay" (which the immigrants mistake for the Spanish informal word for a friend, ''ese'') on ''The Old Man and the Sea''. He is the only one of the children in South Park to speak Spanish fluently, as shown when kids go to him when they cannot understand people, although he is sometimes prone to grammatical errors, such as the previously mentioned example. In "[[The Passion of the Jew]]", Cartman also speaks German, but most of his words are mispronounced, leading us to assume he only knew a few Nazi slogans. However, in "[[Funnybot]]", these assumptions were proven incorrect, as it was shown that he was fluent in German, with him proclaiming ''Dürfen wir der Kind dort...geboten? (We can offer the child ... here.) Er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. (He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful.)''.

In "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]", he exploited a controversy involving the appearance of Muhammad on Family Guy to try to get the show off the air; he pretended to be the hapless victim of an Islamic terrorist attack to try to discourage the FOX president and the Family Guy staff writers from airing the [[Muhammad]] episode. On another occasion he was able to convince the majority of the adults of South Park (as well as many people from other cities and the entire state of South Carolina) to nearly take over the U.S. via an out-of-hand re-enactment of the Civil War, as long as he kept them drunk so they would not realize what they were doing.

Cartman is also a very good leader as a pirate captain, in "[[Fatbeard]]", when he convinces all the Somalian pirates to join his crew, and causes so much trouble to international shipping that the United States Navy had to track him down and kill his crew.

[[File:ScottTenormanMustDie30.gif|thumb|left|The aftermath of Cartman's greatest triumph in "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]".]]
Cartman's shining accomplishment (according to [[Comedy Central]]'s list of "Cartman's 25 Greatest Moments") came in the episode "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", a testimony to Cartman's hidden ingenuity and cunning, as well as the full extent of his cruelty and mental imbalance. [[Scott Tenorman]] continually defeats Cartman's attempts at retrieving a sum of money Scott tricked him out of throughout the episode, humiliating Cartman and elevating his hatred and desire for revenge. Finally, Cartman gets the last laugh, as he indirectly coerces Scott's parents into a situation where they are trespassing, and are consequently shot and killed. Cartman then steals the bodies and makes them into chili which he promptly feeds to Scott. Cartman then coolly tells Scott how his parents died, hints at what happened to their remains, and inquires about his chili: "''Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?''". Scott is traumatized and horror-stricken, and Cartman gloats and laughs hysterically at the inconsolable Tenorman, while licking Scott's "tears of unfathomable sadness" off his face with intense pleasure. However, Scott discovered that Jack Tenorman was also his father, much to his shock, but not because he killed his own dad, but because he is half-ginger, ever since Cartman vowed to get revenge on Tenorman again and get the last laugh.

Cartman has also organized several groups of boys when rallying against his enemies, including an online griefer (in "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]") and the girls on at least 2 occasions: Where he tries to obtain a "future telling device" in "[[Marjorine]]", and when he captures a list of what the girls declared the cutest guys in "[[The List]]", the boys following Cartman's plans. He is always the leader, and manages to lead all the boys in the group into success almost every time. Butters, Kenny, or [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] usually act as his right-hand man, and recurring members of the groups include Token, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Butters, but most of the time they (with the exception of Butters and sometimes Clyde) seem to realize how mentally imbalanced he is.

During the episode "[[T.M.I.]]", the psychologist started to criticize his obesity as a way to test his anger, as Cartman was suspected to have anger management problems. During the time of being yelled at, Cartman does not seem to demonstrate any angry response and simple allows the psychologist to curse Cartman's obesity, and even proceeds to sends a text message/e-mail on his iPhone in a non-concerned manner. Almost immediately on the psychologist receives a phone-call from his frantic wife, claiming that she moments ago received a police report about the psychologist having an affair with an under-aged girl. Confused, the horrified doctor hears her shoot herself with a gun over the phone, Looking back at his patient, Cartman says in a cold voice, "I'm not fat, I'm big boned". This cruel one-line comment along with the fact the supposed police report came from a "[[Mitch Conner]]" indicates that he was responsible for her suicide due to the doctor's remarks. This may echo the Scott Tennorman incident, stressing the importance of why it is not a good idea to provoke Cartman, as terrible consequences may ensue if you are not within his immediate "circle of friends".

====Ventriloquism====
Cartman has been shown to be an expert in the act of ventriloquism, as shown in "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", "[[200]]", and "[[201]]". It is also shown that Cartman sometimes uses his talent to express his delusional side, he demonstrates this through his hand, which he calls [[Mitch Conner]]. In "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", his hand has an affair with [[Ben Affleck]], gets signed onto a record company, and almost gets him killed by [[Jennifer Lopez]]. He seemed go through all of that solely for the purpose of tricking the rest of [[The Boys|the boys]]. Although, in "[[200]]", it is shown that [[Mitch Conner]] may be a real being, as he was shown to possess knowledge that Cartman did not.

====Electronics====
Cartman is shown in "[[T.M.I.]]" to send a message to an anger management psychologist's wife in mere minutes, making it look like a police report; Cartman had to find the location / number of The Psychologist in order to send the message. Cartman is also shown to type very fast, as he wrote apparent emails about a teenage girl having a sexual affair with The Psychologist.

====Multilingualism====
Throughout the entire run of the South Park series, there have been a few instances where Cartman spoke languages other than English quite well and he does seem to be fluent in Spanish and speaks very good German (for the sake of South Park). For example, in "The Passion Of The Jew", when Cartman dressed as Hitler, while rallying outside the theater presenting "The Passion" with a group of Christian followers, he began chanting hateful comments to Jews in German such as "''Es Ist Zeit zu säubern''" ("It's time to cleanse"), while the crowd replies ""''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!''" ("We must exterminate the Jews!"). Next, Cartman exclaimed "''Es ist Zeit für Rache!''" ("It is time for revenge") and the crowd replies "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!" ("We must exterminate the Jews!"). While Cartman did not necessarily pronounce the German words correctly, it was pretty clear that he understood what they meant in English and his followers did not.

In "[[Pandemic]]", the boys decided to start their own Peruvian band to earn some spending money. When they spotted a real Peruvian band "stealing their spotlight", after the other boys first confronted them in English and the band members continued to play as if they did not hear them (since they did not speak English), Cartman began yelling at them in Spanish, generally telling them to stop playing in their area. The band paused for a long second in confusion, then continued to play. This then prompted Cartman to repeat what he originally told them in Spanish and out of anger he even snatched one of their instruments away and threw it off into the distance.

Also, in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]" he spoke to Mexican workers in fluent Spanish, suggesting that he is, in fact, fluent or knows a few phrases. He also speaks French to Clyde in "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]" as "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?", or "Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?". This, however, is a line from the song "Lady Marmalade", and considering the meaning of the phrase, likely means that Cartman does not actually speak French. Granted, there really has not been much focus on this particular talent of Cartman's (since most of the story plots do not focus on it) so there's virtually very little known as to how he learned these other languages so well at such a young age. It is possible that his mom Liane Cartman may have personally taught him the other languages, as was revealed in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" when she purchased a educational game that helped Cartman to improve his spelling skills.

In "[[Funnybot]]", Cartman speaks German to the Germans, seemingly offering them Kyle as a way to make peace with them, or just kill him.

====Music====
[[File:ChristianRockHard10.jpg|left|thumb|Cartman's cover for Faith + 1.]]
Cartman appears to be musically talented. He plays the piano quite well in the episode "[[Christian Rock Hard]]" (although the piano plays by itself whilst he is singing so it may be a player piano and Cartman cannot play it), the violin in "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", the French horn in "[[Summer Sucks]]", the drums in "[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]", the harmonica in "[[Jakovasaurs]]" and "[[Whale Whores]]", the recorder flute in "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]", the acoustic guitar in "[[Chinpokomon]]", and pan flute in "[[Pandemic]]". He is shown to be randomly strumming a guitar and beating the drums so he is not too good at them.

His Christian rock group "[[Faith + 1]]" sold 1,000,000 copies of its album in the episode "[[Christian Rock Hard]]" with the intent of earning a platinum album but according to the Christian Music Association their artists only receive Myrrh for this achievement.

In the film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Cartman is shown singing in mock versions of Chinese, French, Dutch and an unidentified African language by singing "[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]".

In "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", Cartman sings, "[[O Holy Night]]" (despite several interruptions).

In "[[Chef Aid]]", he sings and does a German dance to raise money for Chef's legal fees.

He founded a boy band named [[Fingerbang]] in the episode "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]".

Cartman's musical tastes run toward progressive and arena rock in general and maudlin power ballads in particular. "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]" shows for the first time that Cartman has the uncontrollable urge to finish singing [[wikipedia:Styx (band)|Styx]]'s "[[Come Sail Away]]" whenever he hears any part of the song, which he can do, under pressure, in 27 seconds (possibly a sign that he has a very minor case of OCD based on the fact that he mentioned it was not only songs he had to finish). In "[[Kenny Dies]]", Cartman sings "[[Heat of the Moment]]" to the United States House of Representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research. Cartman also appears to enjoy teen pop, as demonstrated in his [[Britney Spears]] dance sequence in "[[AWESOM-O]]". He also quotes, "Haha charade you are" from Pink Floyd's song, Pigs (Three Different Ones). During a scene in "[[Whale Whores]]" Cartman sings the Lady Gaga song "[[Poker Face]]" while playing the video game Rock Band with Kenny as the drummer. This song was later released as a real downloadable single for the game.

Cartman frequently bursts into song spontaneously, sometimes with melodies and topical lyrics of his own devising, although his musical talent is questionable. He often uses this skill in order to persuade others by using the song to manipulate their thoughts and emotions. This penchant for ''ad hoc'' songs was specifically mentioned in "[[Ginger Kids]]". This also happened in the episode "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]" when Stan asks Cartman to donate a kidney to a very sickly Kyle, Cartman replies by singing "No no no no no no no no no no!" to the tune of "Comedy tonight" from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum".

In a mean-spirited feeling, Cartman begins singing an Elvis version of "[[In the Ghetto]]" when in Kenny's neighborhood, namely, the poor part of town.

For Rush's ''Snakes and Arrows'' tour, a short animated clip was made to introduce the song "Tom Sawyer", featuring the boys from South Park as a band attempting to perform the song. Cartman is featured as the lead singer (Geddy Lee). In "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]", he bursts into song, singing "Kyle's Mom's a Bitch" he also did this in "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]", despite Kyle's repeated warnings.

Cartman has also been featured on several tracks on all three ''South Park'' albums.

====Photography====
Cartman knows a bit about Photography, as shown in a few episodes. In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", he demonstrates his knowledge of the nature of music artist's album covers, such as how the members of a band are mostly in random places looking in other directions and never smile. Also, in "[[Cartman Sucks]]", Cartman takes up his hobby of inviting Butters over, just to take embarrassing photos of him. He is also shown presenting a slideshow in class, and comments about them skillfully. Also, in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]" and "[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]", he is talking about how he should take his picture of Kyle sucking his balls. He even has professional help with his photo shoot in Part III. Also he is good at Photoshop, (though his art skills are very first grade like) as we can see from "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]", when he is framing Kyle.

====Sports====
Cartman has been bad at sports, and sometimes good. He has been seen playing center in Football in "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]" and on the Dodge-Ball team in the episode "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]". He plays Baseball, as he is seen hitting a home run and plays catcher on the Baseball team, as seen as one of the three players ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and Cartman) hitting a home run in "[[The Losing Edge]]".

In "[[Grey Dawn]]" he is seen playing street hockey along with the rest of the boys as a goalie. In later episodes "[[ManBearPig]]" and "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", Cartman is seen to be playing basketball with the other boys, however he is not nearly as talented as he seems to think or the others. He often cries out 'Stop cheating you black asshole!' when an opponent beats him, or 'You tricked me!' as if this was illegal. However, Cartman seems to have a grasp of cheating strategies (as seen in "[[Eek, A Penis!]]".) Cartman tries out for the wrestling team in "[[W.T.F.]]", but leaves after he is put into a "gay" move by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who was told by [[Mr. Conners|the teacher]] to do so. In the same episode he formed a wrestling league along with some of the other boys. However, the wrestling in which they performed was more dramatic theater in which they created complicated in depth story lines for their wrestling personas, rather than actual athletic prowess.

Cartman is also seen as a not very good swimmer in "[[Summer Sucks]]". Cartman is upstaged by handicapped children in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", where his elaborate plan to beat the handicapped children in athletics backfires, with him placing dead last in every sport. In "[[1%]]", he performed so poorly on the school's gym athletics test that it brought the school's average down to the worst in the country.

====Weaponry====
Cartman is shown carrying more weapons than any other kid in South Park, although where he obtains these weapons is never properly explained. He has been shown using a dagger when trying to stop Stan and Kyle from destroying the [[Wall-Mart]], and a pair of sai (a Japanese short sword) in "[[Good Times with Weapons]]". He never actually struck anyone with these weapons, although it is pretty obvious he could have.

In the early episode "[[Chickenlover]]", Cartman receives a nightstick (otherwise known as a baton) due to his duty as police officer. He constantly uses it to abuse suspects and criminals, usually hitting them in the legs.

In "[[Imaginationland]]", Cartman is seen brandishing a Bowie knife.

In "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", he also was shown using a very potent type of mace designed for use on bears. He uses it with gusto on suspects and people evading capture, as well as on people who probably did not need it. The rest of his crew uses the same mace.

Cartman also carries around what appears to be a Glock 17 pistol that has been seen in a few episodes. He however has never fired it, and only uses it to threaten people. He used it to "persuade" Kyle into giving him his Jew Gold in "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]." In "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", Cartman used it to threaten the president of FOX, however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it, causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration. In "[[The China Probrem]]" when he and Butters stormed a Chinese restaurant, and he orders Butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders (although Cartman begins to regret giving Butters the firearm, as Butters keeps accidentally shoots men in the dick). His most recent use of the weapon was in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", where he threatens [[Liane Cartman|his mother]] at gunpoint, who soon after reciprocated the action.

Despite the fact that he has many weapons at his disposal, he does not seem to be very good with them. In "[[Wing]]", he is seen firing an unidentified assault rifle, although he never can land precise shots with it due to the recoil making Cartman flail his arms around, although this is understandable as 9 year olds are not generally intended to use firearms. He killed two Chinese but he was not aiming at them. He also shows an inability to use his dagger when fighting Kenny over the Wall-Mart, although it is likely he either had no interest in killing Kenny (only use the dagger for threatening people), or that he was too pre-occupied with Kenny lightly slapping him to use it.

Cartman uses bladed finger gloves similar to Freddy Krueger when dressed as The Coon. Cartman beats up several people with these weapons; Mint Berry Crunch and The Mosquito at the same time, though it was a surprise attack, a little girl in an airport; several adults in an attempt to stop "murders" and "rapes", and fights off [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] and [[General Disarray]], though he is eventually beaten. This shows skill, though most were surprise.

Cartman gains the ability to fire electricity at people in "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut]]" by way of a defective [[V-Chip]]. Cartman uses this ability by using words that are considered naughty. Cartman kills a black demon, and is shown beating [[Saddam Hussein]] in a fight, whereas the military could not even harm him with machine guns. Cartman also rises into the air after a chain of naughty words, including "[[Barbra Streisand]]". Cartmans electrokinesis is gone in the show, most likely removed as a result of [[Satan]] making everything "go back to how it used to be" as per Kenny's final request.

In "[[1%]]", Cartman successfully engineers ( Subconsciously, in a psychotic delusion. ) the "deaths" of all his stuffed animals. Cartman "kills" [[Clyde Frog]] by slicing him open in several places, and crucifying him to a tree, showing skill with a blade, and enough strength to force sewing needles into a tree; he "kills" Peter Panda by setting him on fire while sleepwalking; he "kills" [[Muscleman Marc]] by supposedly boiling him alive; he hooks a bomb collar he apparently made himself onto Wumpletumpkins, showing immense skill with traps and explosives as well as creating and inventing deadly weapons that could be used by the military; and he shoots [[Polly Prissypants]] in the head with a magnum revolver several times and using the entire load case of the gun, which was 6 shots total, showing incredible marksmanship, never missing a shot, and always hitting the head and not damaging the chair at all despite the recoil the revolver had.

Cartman, along with the ret of the town, gets addicted to guns in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", although he does not fire one.

====Cooking====
In the episode "[[Ass Burgers]]", Cartman is shown to be able to cook hamburgers very well, if only achievable after putting them in his underpants.

Cartman also makes something called a "Toaster Pastry Chocolate Mix Butter Bar", by taking two pop tarts and sandwiching them with a stick of butter covered in chocolate milk mix in "[[Fat Camp]]".

===Facebook===
[[File:N107325192636835_435.jpg|thumb|Picture From Cartman On Facebook]]
Cartman has a Facebook account as seen in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]". He ran a regular podcast named Mad Friends (parody of Mad Money). The episode is based on the ever growing [[Facebook]] craze. He tried to help Kyle delete [[Kip Drordy]] and get new friends by using Chat Roulette, but the only result he got were men masturbating and pictures of penises. In the real world, he has a Facebook account which is run by someone from [[South Park Studios]].

===Address===
In the episode "[[Jakovasaurs]]", Cartman's backpack is shown with a tag that reads:
::E. Cartman
::21208 E. Bonaza Cir.
::South Park, CO

===Heroic Moments/Heroism===
*In "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", his intolerance of hippies saves South Park from a drug-filled hippie music festival.
*In "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]", his frequent use of vulgarity, after getting electrocuted by a power box, coupled with the experimental V-chip implanted in his brain to stop him from swearing (which gave him temporary electrostatic powers), deliberately helps save the world from Saddam Hussein.
*In "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]", by filling his TiVo with the history channel and dropping it and himself into a pool, he able to travel back in time to 1776, where he is able to institute the American tradition of Ice Cream Thursdays and return to South Park with a special 100th episode message about war and peace.
*In "[[The Snuke]]", Cartman's intolerance against Muslims and his use of racial profiling save the day.
*In "[[Grey Dawn]]", Cartman is the boy that figures out that by shutting down [[Country Kitchen Buffet]], the elderly would not have anywhere to get food, this being one of the few occasions where the boys rely on Cartman's planning (but only to an extent; Cartman wanted Kyle to suicide bomb the Buffet, but Stan over-ruled that and said they would only lock the doors.)
*In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", Cartman is under the belief that he was a ghost trapped on Earth until things were made right. He distracts three escaped convicts who were holding ten people hostage at the Red Cross while [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] lets them escape. Also in this episode Cartman makes up for all his previous wrongs such as the [[Sally Struthers]] incident ("[[Starvin' Marvin]]"), the Pre-School incident ("[[Pre-School]]"), feeding parents to their child ("[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"), and crapping in the [[Principal Victoria]]'s purse (seven times), though he was not really sorry.
*In "[[Smug Alert!]]", he saves [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s family from a smug storm (however, this is due to the fact that Cartman had no one else to taunt and insult).
*In "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", Cartman, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] logged into [[World of Warcraft]] together to kill the player killer [[Jenkins]]' character. First, Stan retrieves the [[Sword of a Thousand Truths]] from his dad. Then, Kenny shoots his arrow and Kyle uses magic to paralyze Jenkins' character. And finally, after Cartman says, "''Looks like you're about to get pwned''", he crushes the player killer's head with his war hammer.
*In "[[The Succubus]]", Cartman helps his friends to save [[Chef]] from unknowingly marrying a [[Veronica|Succubus]]. Unfortunately, he does not prove to be very useful because at the time he was recovering from laser corrective surgery for his eyes.
*In "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", Cartman helps Kyle to save his brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] from his Kindergarten teacher [[Ms. Stevenson]], whom Ike was having an unhealthy sexual relationship with. Although Cartman was doing it mainly because the two were making out in the school hallways while he was the hall monitor (a job he took very seriously), he proves extraordinarily helpful and Kyle thanks him.
*In "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]", Cartman, angry at the other boys for missing his commercial debut, kicks the star projector, sending the full blast of the mind control machine into [[Dr. Tristan Adams|Dr. Adams]]' brain, saving the kids, Mr. Mackey, and [[Nurse Gollum]] from being put under mind control.
*In "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]", Cartman repeatedly outsmarts, injures, and humiliates [[Osama Bin Laden]] until he is executed by a US soldier.
*In "[[The Coon]] series", Cartman's secret identity is [[The Coon]], former leader of a superhero-group [[Coon and Friends]]. Where he and the boys try to help people in trouble. However, he seems to merely use this for the fame that comes with it.
*In "[[The Poor Kid]]", Cartman told on the abusive foster parents to his Councilor. If he did not tell on the foster parents, Mysterion would not have been able to save [[Karen McCormick|Karen]] and the foster kids as easily.

==Appearance==
Cartman wears a red jacket, yellow mittens, a blue hat with a yellow puff ball on top, brown pants, black shoes, and white socks (as seen in "[[Super Fun Time]]"). He sometimes wears a green t-shirt with a bear picture on under his jacket, a white tank top, and occasionally a dark red t-shirt. He has medium-brown hair and a double-chin. He also has triangular-shaped eyebrows, in contrast to the other main boys' rectangular ones. Even though Cartman is overweight, he always denies it (especially in the earlier seasons) by saying, "I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned", or some variation thereof. However, as seen in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]" and "[[Cartmanland]]", his weight problem may be, in truth, be genetic and runs in the family, as seen by the fact that, with the exception of his mother an aunt, and [[Alexandra Cartman|a cousin]], his entire family is extremely overweight. But in "[[Fat Camp]]", when he tells his mother to talk about how he is big boned and such, she instead says, "Those were all lies, sweetie, you're just fat." In "[[Tsst]]", he is slightly thinner, although in later episodes, he was shown to have regained the lost weight. Cartman likely has blue irises, as, due to the events of "[[The Succubus]]", he has Kenny's eyes, which were shown with blue in "[[Starvin' Marvin]]". In [[Season Twenty]], he wears a t-shirt with the words "Token's life matters".

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Cartman is supposedly converted into Judaism. He wears a dark gray suit with black tie and white shirt, along with a pair of round glasses. His yarmulke resembles the blue hat with yellow puff that he wears in childhood.

==Personality==
[[File:EricWithoutHat.jpg|thumb|Cartman uncapped in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"]]
Cartman is described in various terms, in short, he is an evil, vicious, angry, self-absorbed, immature, destructive, sarcastic, snooty, loud-mouthed, lazy, and insane child. He is the most foul-mouthed character in the show. He is also racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees. The very dark, usually disturbing undertones to his personality often hint at an extreme mental imbalance. Apart from being portrayed as having a general lack of moral responsibility or social conscience, he also seems to take pleasure from others' misfortune and is generally unable to show empathy, although there have been exceptions, such as in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]." Despite the severity of his actions, it is likely that they are a type of emotional defense mechanism against his insecurity and (potential) confused sexuality. This "defense", however, does not seem to be impenetrable, as evidenced by "[[1%]]". This has been parodied as well, in the cliché of a typical villain becoming benevolent. In these episodes, he usually convinces [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that he has good intentions, such as in the "[[Cartoon Wars Part I|Cartoon Wars]]" two-parter, where Cartman appears to Kyle that he is concerned about people's safety at the beginning, but it is later shown to only have been doing it to get ''[[Family Guy]]'' off the air. In the "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" and "[[Probably]]" two-parter, Kyle and many others fall for Cartman's apparently "good intentions" for trying to prevent the children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from going to hell. However, it is revealed that he only did it so he could earn money. In "[[Kenny Dies]]", he is distraught at [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] impending death leading Kyle to console him. Later when his supposedly real motives were revealed, knowing how Cartman typically is, Kyle promptly fights him in Kenny's defense, although Cartman was genuinely distraught over Kenny's illness before and after he learns that he can benefit from it. This clearly shows that Cartman went through Congress for Kenny and reveals that he does not have a healthy way of dealing with the death of his friend.

Cartman can, on rare occasions, show compassion towards cats, as in "[[Major Boobage]]" in which he hides cats in his attic from the authorities. This compassion hints that he has not progressed to be a full sociopath.

In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", Kyle sums up Cartman's character as a "fat, racist, self-centered, intolerant, manipulative sociopath".

[[File:SouthParkIsGay025.png|right|thumb|Cartman as a metrosexual in "[[South Park is Gay!]]"]]
He has been shown to harass and bully people at his school, and, as a result, many people in the show despise him. Cartman, however, does not consider himself to be a bully who likes to pick on other people to pleasure himself; in fact, he seems to disregard good or bad altogether (or perhaps simply does not have a concept of it) and does whatever he feels necessary for him to get ahead. Cartman seems to be motivated not so much by personal gain as by asserting superiority over others. In "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]", he won $20 in a bet with Kyle, but, instead of using the money, he simply kept flaunting it in front of Kyle until Kyle conceded that Cartman was right, ruining his sense of victory and causing him to throw a tantrum (and apparently even abandon the money and having it given back to Kyle). The same thing happens in "[[Christian Rock Hard]]": Kyle makes a $10 bet that he can get a platinum album before Cartman, Cartman makes a successful album and makes millions of dollars and earning the album. But, when Cartman wins a myrrh album and discovers that the Christian companies do not give out platinum albums ([[Jesus Christ|Christ]] did not believe in such things, the albums stem from the gifts of the three wise men; they give out gold, frankincense, and myrrh albums), thus meaning he cannot win the bet, he angrily destroys the myrrh album, showing that he did not care how he just made millions of dollars, he just wanted to beat Kyle in a bet.

Cartman's much quoted line, "Respect my authority" (or as Cartman pronounces it, "respect mah authori-tah") highlights his power hungry and dictatorial characteristics. Despite these traits, Cartman rarely commands respect from his peers. Cartman's friendships with the other kids are clearly existent, but just not shown as much because of his personality.

Ironically, despite (or perhaps because of) these qualities, Cartman also seems to be a natural leader, able to utilize overwhelming charisma and rhetoric to gain the obedience of large groups on a moment's notice (as in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]"), appearing to be innately aware of how to take advantage of "mob mentality" and direct it toward accomplishing his personal goals, as has been evidenced in countless episodes throughout the series' history. In situations where the other boys share his goals, Cartman is often the ''de facto'' leader (e.g. "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", "[[The List]]", and "[[Marjorine]]"). Indeed, the others consistently show a willingness to follow him and trust in his leadership when he is using his abilities for "good."

Cartman also seems to share many of the shows creators' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) more controversial opinions, despite both of them modeling Stan and Kyle after themselves. Examples of this include an extremely strong dislike for ''[[Family Guy]]'' for its lack of character development, plot, or smart humor. Other examples include Cartman's strong distaste of hippies, to the point that he has personally kept them out of South Park since he was 4 years old, and his belittlement of the Catholic Church as extremist, homophobic, and a supporter of pedophiles (in "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"). He also considers John Lennon to be the "king of hippies".

===Discrimination===
Even though Cartman is a child, he discriminates against a lot of people. In fact, he is a racist, sexist, and specialist. He hates African Americans, Mexicans, Native Americans, Aborigines, and Asians. He is a racist because he thinks that "minorities" would take over the world someday as revealed in "[[The China Probrem]]" and in "[[Pee]]". In first three seasons, Cartman did not show any racism but it soon developed after the events of "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000|Cartman's Silly Hate Crime]]". His discrimination lead to him becoming a bully on Token Black as he was African American. His sexism is also seen in the series as he hates girls too but that is because he is sexually confused. He actually believes that girls and women are weaker than men and stupider too. However he was proven wrong about that after he got beat up by [[Wendy Testaburger]] in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]". His sexism also made him turn his own mom into a personal slave who spoils Eric with anything he wanted, however, she started to resist him in "[[Tsst]]". Cartman's speciesism is also seen in the show and started to show it against his cat, Mr. Kitty. Cartman also has bigotry towards extraterrestrials and is extremely xenophobic but that is simply because some visitors placed an anal probe into him twice, thus starting his speciesism. However this kind of speciesism against alien races is very rarely seen in the show.

===Antisemitism and Other Forms of Bigotry===
[[File:Pinkeye014.png|right|thumb|Cartman as Adolf Hitler]]"
''If you had a chance to go back in time right now and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him, because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?''" - Cartman in "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"

Cartman is extremely anti-Semitic, and a great many of his bigoted actions are directed towards all Jews and especially toward his Jewish friend [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], whom he openly hates and considers sub-human because of his faith. In the episode ."[[The Passion of the Jew]]", after seeing The Passion of the Christ, he believes the film was [[Mel Gibson]]'s way of rallying people against the Jews, and idolizes him for it. He then dresses up as Hitler and manipulates a group of people, who think that they are simply raising awareness for the movie and Christianity, to join him in an anti-Jew march while chanting in mispronounced [[Wikipedia:Germany|German]]: "''Es ist Zeit für Rache''" (It is time for revenge'') and "''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten''" (''We must exterminate the Jews'').''

When he tried to win the Special Olympics by feigning a disability in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]" , Kyle attempts to talk him out of it by telling him, regardless of their differences, that Cartman will surely go to [[Hell]] for such an act; Cartman replies that Kyle does not understand that Hell is reserved for the Jews, indicating once again his self-righteousness. He also has been shown to consider Judaism to be a disability and the title "Jew" to be an insult. He also believes Jews to be incapable of many professions, such as [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|basketball player]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|singing/rhythm]], [[Pre-School|fireman]], [[Fatbeard|pirate]] or even so much as [[Something You Can Do with Your Finger|someone tough]], however on some occasions his accusations have been proven true (particularly rhythm).

In the episode "[[Pinkeye]]", Cartman dresses up as Hitler for Halloween (A costume made by his mother even though Cartman himself did not know who Hitler was, showing that his antisemitism may come from his mother in some part). When shown a documentary to demonstrate why dressing like him is not cool, Cartman is enthralled and imagines himself being the one commanding the Nazi troops in the video. Cartman's admiration for Hitler is further emphasized in "[[The Entity]]", after being offered $40 by Kyle not to tease Kyle's cousin, [[Kyle Schwartz]]. Since Cartman has trouble restraining himself from teasing Kyle Schwartz about his Jewish heritage (since he is the stereotypical Jew that Kyle Broflovski had been trying to avoid being for five years), when [[Ms. Choksondik]] later tells Kyle Schwartz to concentrate, Cartman impulsively blurts out: "''Maybe we should send him to concentration camp!''"

A contradiction of his idolization of Adolf Hitler is seen in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]" where in this episode Cartman is incapable of pronouncing "Nazi" correctly (pronouncing it "Nay-zee") upon seeing it written, as though he had never come upon the word before. Another contradiction occurs in "[[Tsst]]", when Cartman compares his mother who had been instructed how to treat her rampantly egocentric son by the Dog Whisperer, with Hitler, as a reason why she should be killed (although this is probably because Cartman is not being allowed to indulge in his personal desires).

In addition to taking regular jabs at racial, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as people of lower income like [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], Cartman is also prejudicial against red-haired, light skinned and freckled people, which means that he is anti ginger. This particular prejudice most probably originated from the notorious incident with [[Scott Tenorman]], who had red hair and freckles, although it may also be partially due to the fact that Kyle has red hair and Liane Cartman's presumed prejudice against red haired people. He believes that ginger kids are the most evil people in the world and that they have no souls, which is clearly false. During the episode "[[Ginger Kids]]", when the other three boys lead him to believe he has become a Ginger himself in order to teach him a lesson, he is horrified. Later, he organizes a cult of homicidal Ginger children bent on world conquest known as the "[[Ginger Separatist Movement]]", remarking: "''I'm not going to live my life as a Goddamn minority!''" Ironically, Cartman has an aunt who is red-haired. An even bigger irony however, would be when he later discover that he was indeed half-Ginger, as his biological father, [[Jack Tenorman]] (who was also father of Scott Tenorman) was a Ginger football player for the [[Denver Broncos]]. This would technically make him a "Daywalker"; he does have the Ginger gene. Cartman hates ginger kids a lot because he thinks that they would take over the world someday and are soulless. Cartman seems to ignore his half ginger heritage in later episodes simply because he is ashamed of it.

Cartman also may harbor some bigotry towards African-Americans. He is never shown out right hating black people (although he does believe in several stereotypes), and is shown several times playing with [[Token]] and seeking advice from [[Chef]] (one of the few characters on the show Cartman generally respected). Although Cartman was in jail for his "hate crime" on Token, even though it is quite obvious he did not bash Token's head with a rock because he is black, but because he thought Token had insulted him (it was in fact Kyle who did this). Even though he usually rips on Token for being black, and he said he is gonna kill Token someday - ("[[Christian Rock Hard]]"), he does not seem to harbor negative feelings for black people, and Cartman always says he is going to kill people, so saying he was going to kill Token might not be personal. In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", when Butters asks him what if he is not supposed to go to Heaven, but to "heck", Cartman responds "''I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!''". This is strange because in [[Up the Down Steroid]] when Kyle informs that Cartman is going to cheat, Cartman responds to this by saying that hell is only reserved for Jews, but he did not include African Americans into the mix.

[[File:Pinkeye079.png|thumb|Cartman as a "Ghost".]]
Cartman's most passionate abhorrence is aimed at hippies, though he seems to use this term for liberals in general. In "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", he believes that hippies will destroy the town, and while the rest of the townspeople are initially skeptical, his fears are eventually borne out. When too close to liberals, he suffers what could be called an [[Wikipedia:Allergy|allergic reaction]]. He also wore a bio-suit upon entering [[San Francisco]] in [[Smug Alert!]]. His primary goal of that was because he needed someone to pick on (he had started to pick on Butters, but Butters just was not feeling it.). Cartman's hatred of hippies and allergic reaction to liberals could mean that Cartman is a conservative. This means that Cartman does support the republican party but he did not tantrum over any losses in presidential elections, unlike [[Ike Broflovski]]. Instead of throwing tantrums, Cartman burglarizes houses and steals property from liberals and conservatives as revealed in [[About Last Night...]] when he broke into peoples houses and stole their T.V.'s in order to make some cash while they were out getting drunk on the streets or had killed themselves. He seems to have some liberal beliefs, he never openly states that he is a Republican but does say that Democrats piss him off, although he does not need to have any objection to them protesting in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]".

Cartman's bigotry and antisemitism seem to come in second next to his personal needs, however; despite his hate for the Jews, Cartman saves Kyle in the episode "[[Smug Alert!]]" because he can find no one else to pick on. In "[[Le Petit Tourette]]", he is not above thanking Kyle for stopping him from humiliating himself on national television. Also, he saved the life of Kyle, (who had been killed by [[Manbearpig]]) in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"; while this was seemingly because Kyle would not be able to suck his balls if he died, he was shown to cry, and showed concern even before the military leader reminded him that "at least now he does not have to suck anyone's balls." Enraged, Cartman yells in despair, "''No, he has a strong heart, he wants to live!!!''" and began performing CPR on his dying "friend".

===Alignment===
Cartman is usually an orderly individual, while his goals are chaotic in nature, he obeys rules when they suit him, even using order to manipulate other people. He often idolizes people whom he feels share his various bigotries and aims. By this reasoning, he falls under "Neutral Evil", with no particular preference towards law or chaos, as either one can be used to his advantage. Cartman is usually cold-hearted and selfish, but can be warm-hearted and caring on a whim. This sensitive and selfless side of Cartman is often a superficial cover up for a selfish scheme he has in mind.

===Eccentricities===
It has been repeatedly shown that Cartman has serious behavioral and emotional problems. He has extremely exaggerated anger issues and violent tendencies when upset. Perhaps the best example of this is seen in "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", when he had two people shot, ground into chili and then fed to their distraught son, causing a horrified Kyle to say that he and Stan should never piss off Cartman again. This has since been regarded as Cartman's defining moment and has been brought up again countless times during the series.

[[File:FreakStrike14.jpg|thumb|"''Whateva, I'll do what I want!''" - Cartman posing as a teenage prostitute]]
He also has displayed traits of gender confusion; he occasionally has tea parties with stuffed dolls (pretending they are talking about how cool he is), owns a (supposed) female cat named "[[Mr. Kitty]]", and in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", he was seen re-enacting a scene from ''[[Wikipedia:The Silence of the Lambs|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' as Buffalo Bill with a rag doll he named Polly Prissy-Pants trapped down a well. In "[[Freak Strike]]", Cartman goes on the Maury Povich Show to be a panelist during a discussion on out-of-control kids. In an attempt to win the assumed prize, he dresses up as a promiscuous teenage girl. In the episode "[[AWESOM-O]]", Butters reveals to the residents of South Park a video of Cartman dressed as [[Britney Spears]], while dancing around a cardboard cut-out of Justin Timberlake, which he apparently later made out with.

Cartman's confused sexuality is most apparent in the episode "[[Cartman Sucks]]", in which Cartman takes pictures of himself with Butters' penis in his mouth to make Butters look gay. However, Kyle, Stan and Kenny explain that such actions actually make Cartman look gay, which results in Cartman trying to get a picture taken of his own penis in Butters' mouth. Another moment of this apparent confusion can be seen during the events of the "[[Imaginationland]]" trilogy, where he bet Kyle that leprechauns were real, and if he won, Kyle would have to suck his balls. Although Cartman was proven to be right, Kyle refused, causing Cartman to become obsessed, and began going to extreme lengths to force Kyle to suck on his balls. When [[Jimmy]] later questions his motive behind pursuing Kyle to get him to suck his balls as being "a little faggy", he explains that it was all to humiliate Kyle. In [[Le Petit Tourette]] he unconsciously blurts out that he touched penises with his [[Elvin Cartman|cousin]].

===Mispronunciations===
Ever since Cartman's voice has changed, he has a peculiar, geographically indeterminable accent, or possibly speech impediment, with odd pronunciations of certain words and names which has shown to be a dominant trait in the extended Cartman family. Aside from the sheer volume of expletives in his dialog, he also uses words in different (and often grammatically incorrect) context. Some examples of this are: instead of saying 'I'm serious" he will say "I'm seriously", instead of saying "here" he will say "heahre" (sometimes in the earlier episodes, he would even pronounce "here" as "myah"), apologized to Wendy by saying he was very "remoursefulness" for his actions ("[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"), and instead of saying ''"respect my authority"'', he would say ''"respect mah authoritah."'' This became a well-known catchphrase of the show.

*Kyle - Kahl / Keh-al / Kel / Kyel
*Kenny - Keeny / Kinny
*Wendy - Weendy / Windy
*Clyde - Clay / Clayed
*Mom - Meom / Meem / Mium
*Cool - Kewl
*School - Schewl
*Coon - Cyoon / Cyune
*My- Mah / Miah / Mio
*Authority - Authoritah
*Here - Hyah

In the episode, "[[The Poor Kid]]", Cartman was finally confronted by other characters about his mispronounciations. When Cartman says "I beat you to it, Kyel," Kyle retorts, "My name is not Kyel." Later on in the episode, after Cartman screamed for his new foster mother, [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead|Mrs. Weatherhead]] walked into the room, replying with "My name is not Meem."

===Greed===
A defining arc during the show's [[Season Four|fourth season]] was Cartman's single-minded quest to make 10 million dollars. The schemes he has tried include; [[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000|becoming a part of the Denver "tooth racket"; and stealing Tooth Fairy money from kids]], [[Something You Can Do with Your Finger|starting a boy band called Fingerbang]], and [[Probably|forming his own church and embezzling its collection money]] These all failed miserably for several reasons. He also tried at it in the episode "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]" when Kyle's kidneys were failing and Cartman, being the only one with Kyle's blood type, demanded a payment of 10 million dollars when Stan begged him to let Kyle have his kidney. He has also tried to [[Kenny Dies|sell a crashed truck-load of aborted fetuses]] to the highest-bidding stem cell research center, and even to [[Shakey's Pizza|a restaurant]] as food. In "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", Cartman had also pretended he was retarded to compete in the Special Olympics and win $1000. The reasons for this are never fully explained, although in one episode "[[Cartmanland]]", after inheriting a million dollars from his grandmother, he reveals that he wishes to buy his own amusement park so he would not have to wait in lines for the rides. He also stated that it has been his dream to own a million dollars since he was two years old. In "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", he threatens Kyle with a gun for his "[[Jew Gold]]". In "[[ManBearPig]]" Cartman stumbles upon a pile of treasure while the boys are trapped in a system of caves. Afraid that the others might find the treasure and demand a share, Cartman decides to swallow as many of the coins and jewels as he can, causing him to become extremely bloated and unable to walk or swim on his own. Later in the episode it is revealed, during the process of painfully crapping it out, that the treasure is fake and used for photographs for tourists at the caves. He is miserably and completely scrooged, determined not to give up the slightest amount of money, such as refusing to give a dollar to Afghan children in "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]", "I'm not giving a ''dollar'' to those towel-heads!" [[Craig Tucker]] observed in "[[Fishsticks]]" that [[Jimmy]] was lucky Cartman was only asking for half the money that would be made from patenting a joke that Jimmy had come up with, and Cartman was intent on taking credit for (he had actually lied on the couch eating chips, offering no input).

===Ignorance===
Although Cartman can at times be worldly, he is often wildly misinformed; he once believed that dolphins lived in igloos and mistook a canned food drive for 'when you cut open a chick's stomach and pull out the baby from inside,' and mistakes sexual harassment when 'you're having intercourse with a lady friend and someone tickles your balls from behind.'

Cartman appears to know very little about the female anatomy. In "[[The Return of Chef]]" he threatened a woman with, "''Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off''". Also, in the episode "[[Chickenpox]]", when he was told that his [[Liane Cartman|mom]] sent him to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s house so he would catch chickenpox, he claimed that he would "kick her square in the nuts". In "[[Raisins]]", he agreed with Butters when he said to Bebe "''Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes.''"

In "[[The List]]", he made a plan to steal a list the girls made of who the cutest boys in the class were. The plan involved Butters kicking one of the girls in the balls, which failed of course, forcing Cartman and the rest of the boys to conclude that "Our mission failed, but we've learned a lot; primarily that girls do not have balls". Despite this, in "[[Member Berries]]" he was shown to still not have learned this. In "[[Fort Collins]]", having seen [[Heidi Turner]]'s vagina, it is implied he still does not realize women do not have balls.

In "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]", Cartman claimed he had hit puberty because he had his period, when really he had an infection that made him bleed out his butt (he did not realize that only girls got periods until [[God]] told him at the end of the episode.)

In "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", it is shown that Cartman's idea of sexual intercourse is to "''Stick it inside her and pee. If you don't want to get her pregnant you pull it out and pee on her leg.''" In the [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|first episode]]. Cartman complains "Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!" showing ignorance of the context in which "dildo" is used and, possibly, what a dildo is. However, it is possible he is using it as a generic insult, such as calling someone a "dick".

Also in [[Pee]], his ignorance is again displayed when he thinks all the minorities in "his" water park are what the Mayans predicted and by 2012, the apocalypse will be when the whole world is minorities.

Cartman also confuses English people with French people. In the early seasons, he often teased Pip and called him a "''French piece of crap''". On the other extreme, in the movie, he called [[The Mole]] a "'British piece of' shit", despite The Mole being supposedly French. Additionally, in "[[The Jeffersons]]", he alludes to despising Austrians, apparently failing to note the irony of the fact that he admires Hitler, who was Austrian.

It is also worth noting that Cartman is completely oblivious to the fact the other kids hate him, and often assumes they are joking when they imply or even openly declare it.

In the episode "[[201]]" Cartman completely ignores the fact that he got his own father killed and fed to his half-brother and is more concerned about being half-ginger.

In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", Cartman is oblivious to the fact that his making another student crap herself is useless when trying to prevent the suicide of another student.

===Impatience===
[[File:ImALittleBitCountry061.png|right|thumb|Cartman in the 1700s.]]
Cartman shows a pathological degree of impatience when forced to do something he does not want to do or when he has to wait for something he wants. An example of the former is seen in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]", in which Cartman electrocutes himself in an attempt to create a flashback and avoid studying. In the episode "[[Go God Go]]", where Cartman freezes himself so that he would not have to wait three weeks for the [[List of Video Game References#Nintendo Wii|Nintendo Wii]] console to be released, which shows irony in the end; Butters cannot find where Cartman was frozen due to an avalanche, and Eric is thawed out almost 500 years in the future, the people there zap him back to his own time where it turns out that he got sent back three ''months'' before the Wii's release. In [[Medicinal Fried Chicken]], Cartman is shown to be extremely agitated when he has waited to have [[KFC]] for too long and blurts out obscenities and shouting horrible things to his friends and to his mom Liane Cartman and when the KFCs get replaced with medicinal marijuana stores, he goes to an addiction clinic to be prescribed with KFC gravy.
===Physical Confrontations===
Although Cartman frequently insults and taunts his friends, he sometimes appears to be more cowardly than they are when it comes to physical confrontation. In "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", after Cartman repeatedly threatens to beat Kyle up if they do not get home in time for Christmas, Kyle punches Cartman and he immediately bursts into tears. A similar instance can be seen during "[[Cartman Sucks]]", although Kyle only punches Cartman in the arm. Cartman may react like this to gain sympathy from other boys so he may turn the other boys against Kyle (showcased in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", where he turned Butters and a few other boys against Kyle by exaggerating how Kyle pushed him against a tree) or he could just be cowardly, it is unknown which (It is likely the latter).

At the end of "[[Kenny Dies]]", after Cartman revealed his true motives for fighting to lift the ban on stem cell research, to replicate a "[[Shakey's Pizza]]" and not to save Kenny's life, Kyle, enraged about this, brutally begins to beat up Cartman, delivering several blows to his chest and a good roundhouse right. The beating continued on until the end of the episode and has not been mentioned at all since, although it shows Kyle was able to beat Cartman easily when angry.

[[File:WithApologiesToJesseJackson082.png|thumb|Cartman and [[Dr. David Nelson|Dr. Nelson]], engaged in a fight in "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]".]]
In "[[Goobacks]]", Cartman threatens Kyle and it leads to Kyle giving Cartman a bloody nose. In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", Cartman is beaten up by [[Token Black|Token]] after provoking him with racial jibes. In several episodes, he is seen able to overpower Kenny, but in some episodes he is not capable of doing so. However, in earlier episodes like "[[Damien]]" he is able to beat up Kyle. Despite this, Kyle beat up Cartman in the more recent "[[Tonsil Trouble]]" without hesitation.

In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", Cartman has no problem with fighting the other boys back physically (and it is revealed that Sumo is his martial art of choice). In "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]" he smiles and sings the Dawson's Creek theme while he kills the Official Messenger Boy with a piece of wood then drags the body off-screen, although this happens in what was essentially a fantasy of Cartman's and may, therefore, due to Cartman's inflated ego, not be representative of his actual abilities. Also in the episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", he and Kyle have a slap fight, which he won (though this was more through deceit than skill), and in the episode "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]", he was dominant in a physical fight against a midget (who supposedly had a black belt in karate). Also in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" he threw a rock at Token, giving him a black eye.

In "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", Cartman is shown being physically abusive to innocent kids in the hallways. He once pushes an unnamed kid up against a wall, until the kid showed him his hall pass, after which Cartman acts as if nothing happened. The kid questions Cartman about his abuse of power, and Cartman promptly kicks him across the room in a somewhat cartoonish way, although he is never shown pulling off a feat like that again.

In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", Cartman is shown to be quite nervous over fighting [[Wendy]] and is shown going to great lengths to avoid the confrontation. However, when Wendy decides to fight him regardless, he is quite spectacularly defeated.<br />
Overall, Cartman is a decent fighter, although he can be a wuss and particularly enraged opponents can beat him with ease. His specialty lies more with weapons than his fists.

Throughout all of these scenes, it is heavily suggested that Cartman indeed has a high tolerance for pain, however will often feign pain to gain sympathy from those around him. This shown especially in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", where it was not until after Kyle left did he start crying from being attacked by him, and then later used it to convince other boys to lock him in a meat locker. In "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", Cartman, as [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], beat up Bradley and Clyde after questioning his method of running Coon and Friends. He also gives Clyde a nasty cut after kicking him in the face, showing his jumping abilities and the amount of force he can kick with.

===Miscellaneous Mannerisms===
Cartman has a disturbing habit of appearing in other people's homes in the middle of the night. He has a preoccupation with becoming mature, or at least more so than his friends, which frequently ends in him doing something that is anything but mature. Cartman also appears to be driven by a desire to surpass Kyle (especially), Stan, and Kenny. Knowing that his satisfaction chiefly comes with seeing other people unhappy, Kyle once deliberately congratulated Cartman on winning a bet. This, of course, ruined Cartman's egotistical satisfaction at having humiliated him.

Cartman also carries around what appears to be a Glock 17 pistol that has been seen in several episodes. He has actually never fired it, and only uses it to threaten people. He used it to "persuade" Kyle into giving him his Jew Gold in "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]." In "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", Cartman used it to threaten the president of FOX, however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it, causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration. His most recent use of it was when he and Butters stormed a Chinese restaurant, and he orders Butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders (although Cartman begins to regret giving Butters the firearm because he keeps accidentally shooting men in the genitals).

Cartman apparently sees scenes of sickening and/or disturbing imagery every time he closes his eyes, but thinks nothing of it. He also occasionally has milk come out of his nose when he laughs, even when he was not drinking any. This milk-sneezing problem is due to a malfunctioning kidney, which Cartman is tricked into donating for transplant, benefiting his friend Kyle, who receives the malfunctioning organ as seen in the episode "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]". Many of Cartman's mannerisms were revealed to be inherited in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", in which most of the Cartman family were depicted in a similar manner.

===Health===
Eric is quite possibly morbidly obese. In "[[1%]]", it is revealed that he is so unhealthy that he single-handedly made the school's average on the Presidential Fitness Test the lowest in the entire country, despite the fact that all of the other students scored average on the test.
====HIV====
In the first episode of the twelfth season, "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", it is revealed that Cartman has in the past needed a routine tonsil checkup. In this episode, however, he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and his tonsils had to be removed. In doing so, they accidentally gave him HIV, the virus that causes [[AIDS]]. He was angered by this and his anger worsened when Kyle laughed - out of irony, disbelief and thrill that something so horrible has happened to his worst enemy. Cartman, with the help of Butters, then snuck into Kyle's room and intentionally gave Kyle AIDS. Kyle figured it out and hunted Cartman down and beat him up in the schoolyard and broke many of his toys (including [[Clyde Frog]]). Cartman, in the meantime, researched the virus and found out that [[Magic Johnson]] had AIDS for decades and is still alive. Cartman and Kyle then found out, along with Mr. Johnson, that the actual cure for AIDS was heavy doses of cash, the point being the solution to any problem is to throw lots and lots of cold-hard cash at it. Cartman and Kyle have both since recovered from the disease. Kyle still made it a point to break his Xbox after they come back from New York and LA curing AIDS.

*Kyle's mockery of Cartman's infection with HIV is ironic, since Cartman has wished on many occasions in past episodes for Kyle to have AIDS:
**In "[[Casa Bonita]]", Cartman, Kenny, and Stan are all playing video games when Kyle enters and says that he has good news, to which Cartman hopefully replies "You have AIDS?"
**In "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]", Cartman ends his fictional Christmas story with the line, "And everyone lived happily ever after...except for Kyle who died of AIDS two weeks later." This similar closing line also used in the episode "[[Pip]]".
**In "[[Red Man's Greed]]", Cartman suggests giving Kyle AIDS as a potential way to raise money.
**In "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", while playing a board game Cartman gives Kyle an AIDS card, giving him AIDS in the game. Stan then remarks to Cartman, "Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
====Eyesight====
In the episode "[[The Succubus]]" it is revealed that Cartman's eyesight is very bad. After several unsuccessful attempts by the optician to cure them, including a pupil dilation that resulted in him walking into several walls and a botched laser eye surgery that ended up with Cartman having to wear bandages over his eyes for three days, he managed to get a transplant from a "donor" who's head he had preserved in ice - the donor being [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who Cartman says had perfect sight.
====Mental Health====
[[File:Cartman berrinche.png|right|thumb|Cartman having a tantrum]]
However, obesity, HIV, poor eyesight, and bad tonsils may be the least of Cartman's health concerns; Cartman seems to have a very poor mental health. He shows signs of not only anti-social behavior, but also sadism, identity issues, sexual confusion, psychosis, psychopathic nature, and narcissism. He apparently dreams of humiliating, beating, emotionally destroying or even killing Kyle. For example, in "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", Cartman dreams of taunting Kyle ("I told ya so!") so much that the latter starts crying. In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", he seems to hope to kill Kyle without any reason. However, it was not until the [[Season Five]] episode "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" incident that we see how deep his insanity goes, when he creates a highly elaborate and sociopathy scheme, resulting in murder and cannibalism. In "[[Tsst]]", he beats up a kid, handcuffs him to the flagpole, gives him a hacksaw, poisons him, and tells him the only way to get to the antidote was to saw off his leg. This is similar to the ''Saw'' movies.

Cartman also seems incapable to admit his own errors and history, and instead alters past events in his own mind to show himself in a better light, as seen in "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]" (though so did everyone else) and "[[Fishsticks]]". Cartman's mind even once backfired against him during "[[Le Petit Tourette]]", during which he made everyone believe he was suffering from [[Tourette's Syndrome]], so as to be able to go around saying whatever horrible hateful thing he wanted without consequences. Unfortunate, this resulted in him being completely unable to control what he said, and began revealing assorted secrets such as him and his cousin touching penises. Cartman's sanity is called in to question with the existence of [[Mitch Conner|Mitch Conner/Jennifer Lopez]], who is Cartman's hand given a personality/backstory. In [[Fat Butt and Pancake Head|"Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]" Cartman did ventriloquism with his hand, claiming it thought itself to be a real person, named Mitch Conner, who was a con-man posing as Jennifer Lopez. Cartman would often argue with the hand at length, and the hand would apparently work independently of Cartman, such as masturbating [[Ben Affleck]]. Cartman would later claim it was just a prank on Kyle and the others. However, in "[[200]]", Cartman brings back Mitch Conner to swindle a group of celebrities, and again proceeds to argue with his hand and disagreeing with it, despite the fact there is no one around him to trick, leading one to believe that Cartman really believes the hand is a person. The hand also claims to have knowledge that Cartman does not, such as who Cartman's father really is. In "[[201]]" it is revealed that Cartman is [[Scott Tenorman]]'s half-brother, meaning that he killed his own father; [[Jack Tenorman]] and fed it to Scott Tenorman in a bowl of chili. However, he was more concerned about being half-ginger than the fact that he murdered his own father.

In "[[T.M.I.]]", it is revealed that Cartman has an exceptionally tiny penis (even for a boy of 9 years old), and the insecurity of that seems to a leading or at least additional factor driving Cartman's psychotic rages. When the schools posts height measurements in the hallway for the boys, Cartman assumes it to be penis sizes and demands all the boys measure their sizes to disprove the original measurements. His rage in this particularly incident leads him to getting Anger Management, during which his doctor attempts to insult him to produce an angry reaction. Cartman oddly enough does not demonstrate his rage vocally, in a coldly sadistic manner by manipulating the doctor's wife into killing herself through a simple set of text messages. Cartman is then put in a group anger management session, during which he several like-minded individuals with small penises go on a rage driven rampage.

In "[[1%]]", it appears that Cartman has multiple identity disorder, as he appears to have "murdered" his stuffed animals while having no memory of destroying them. However, it is implied that ventriloquism is used only when the toys speak, and that they do indeed have a mind of their own. For example, Cartman could not possibly have killed his stuffed animals while heading downstairs with Token. Additionally, it is also possible that Peter Panda was killed by the 5th graders. Cartman could be best described as having sadistic personality disorder with passive-aggressive traits, also known as a "Tyrannical Sadist".
===Sexuality===
Cartman often shows less interest in sexuality than the other boys. This seems intentional on the writer's parts, and fits with his self-absorption, immaturity, and gender confusion. An example for this would be seen in the episode "[[Raisins]]", where the boys end up in an [[Raisins (Location)|eponymous Hooters-like restaurant]], and Cartman only shows interest in the food, rather than all the skimpily-dressed waitresses. The other boys, however, do show interest in them, except Stan, who was too depressed at the time because [[Wendy Testaburger]] broke up with him.

In "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", [[Wendy]] kisses Cartman on the lips at the flag debate, due to the fact she had a weird dream about him and started feeling attracted to him in the middle of the episode. However, as soon as she was done kisses him, she had no more feelings for him. Although at the end Cartman walked away sad, when she said they were friends again.

Cartman also displays a lack of knowledge about sex, despite the fact that his mom is frequently having sexual relations with other people in South Park; when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] says that Ike is too young to understand sex in the episode "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", Cartman replies, "What's there to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some, then stick it inside her and pee". Cartman's lack of knowledge is also displayed in the episode "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]", when he tells [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] that sexual harassment is "trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind." However, the other children, except for Kenny, Butters (who explains sex in great depth to Jimmy "[[Erection Day]]" but in a childlike sort of way) and possibly Clyde, do not seem to have more knowledge of sex than Cartman, which is probably because they are only 9 years old.

In "[[Imaginationland]]", Cartman makes a bet with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], stating that if he can prove that leprechauns are real, then Kyle will suck his balls. Cartman wins the bet, and his single-minded quest to force Kyle to suck his balls subsequently becomes a significant subplot of the trilogy. Although he does not get Kyle to suck his balls in reality, he ''does'' imagine Kyle sucking the balls of an imaginary Cartman with much enthusiasm at the end of "[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]". It is quite plausible, however, to assume that Cartman's obsession with his quest stems significantly from his desire to humiliate Kyle, rather than from any homosexual attraction to him.

In "[[Jared Has Aides]]", after listening to Butters get beaten by his parents, as Cartman was responsible for it by pretending to be Butters on the phone and insulting them, Cartman says, "If I were older I would totally start jacking off right now", hinting at sexual sadism.

In '[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", when [[Clyde Donovan]] tells Cartman he is going to stop playing ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', Cartman says that the French also stopped playing when Hitler rose to power. He then taunts [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] by asking him if he is French, and then says, "''Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?''", meaning "Do you want to sleep with me, Clyde?" in French, although he could just be quoting the French lyric from the song "Lady Marmalade" without understanding the meaning, but he could have been taunting him by saying he is French and using the French stereotype as a way to taunt him.

In "[[Cartman Sucks]]", Cartman seeks to humiliate and degrade Butters by taking a picture of himself with Butters' penis in his mouth. After being told by Kyle and Stan that being photographed that way is humiliating him rather than Butters (in other words, being photographed in such a way makes him gay), Cartman then seeks out Butters to make him put his penis in Butters' mouth, but this fails, as the both of them are caught by [[Stephen Stotch|Butters' father]].

In "[[Proper Condom Use]]", Butters is putting on a condom, when Cartman is caught by Kyle looking at Butters' penis; Cartman dismissively claims he was trying to see how to put on a condom, which Kyle does not believe.

In "[[Cancelled]]", Cartman once again finds himself the victim of getting an anal probe from aliens. When Chef and the boys take him to see a proctologist, the doctor sticks his finger and his entire hand in Cartman's rectum. Although initially surprised, Cartman lets out moans of pleasure, just before a fifty-foot satellite dish shoots out of his rectum. Although when the satellite retreats back into his rectum, he experiences severe pain.

However, during the events of "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", Cartman briefly became an object of affection for Stan's girlfriend [[Wendy Testaburger]]. After being passionately kissed by Wendy at the end of the episode, he is disappointed at the end when she says that she no longer has any feelings for him. In "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]", Cartman, along with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and the entire third grade class, were all attracted to the substitute teacher, [[Ms. Ellen]]. Although she was a lesbian, and the boys did not understand what it meant, they tried to become lesbians in order to try to win her. Additionally in "[[Le Petit Tourette]]" he accidentally admitted to having a crush on a girl named [[Patty Nelson]] and also said that he and his cousin "touched wieners".

In "[[W.T.F.]]", he cross dresses as "Bad Irene", a woman who is addicted to abortions.

In "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]" Cartman's uses his hand as a ventriloquist dummy, who claims his hand is a con-artist named [[Mitch Conner]], who is claiming to be [[Jennifer Lopez]]. In order to try and trick the other boys into thinking that his hand might be truly sentient, Mitch/Jennifer (and thus Cartman) pursues a relationship with [[Ben Affleck]] during which Cartman proceeds to give Ben multiple hand jobs, one time even waking up in bed with a naked Affleck, his hand covered in "Affleck splooge". While Cartman claims this to be an act in the end, these sexual actions seems to be unconsciously executed, due to the fact that during or after, Cartman is both shocked and disgusted. The fact Cartman does this could indicate an unconscious sexual desire towards men (Ben Affleck in-particular in this case), Cartman's extreme lengths to trick his friend (despite them not being present to witness the hand jobs, making the actions pointless in the grand scheme of things), or that Cartman's Mitch Conner is part of a psychological break resulting in a multiple personality.

In "[[T.M.I.]]" when the schools posts a list indicating the amount of height that the male students have grown over the past year, Cartman mistakenly assumes it to mean penis size, and goes on a rampage decreeing the "results" to be incorrect due to the tiny size of his own. He then proceeds to demand all the boys submit to new penis measurements, which he personally administers with the exception of his own (due to the fact he falsely claimed to have 13 inch penis). During the process he compliments Butters on his size.

In "[[Cartman Finds Love]]", Cartman's imaginary friend, [[Cupid Me]], debuts. He can only be seen by Cartman himself, which makes the other boys get confused. In "[[Tweek x Craig]]", he reappears and attempts to flirt with Cartman, but Cartman denies he is gay. Cartman ends up on a date with him, ending in anal sex, which is mistaken by Liane for masturbating.

The episode "[[The Damned]]" ends with Cartman asking [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]] what was at the bottom of a vagina, and she responds by saying "want me to show you?", to which he responds "holy shit", as the end credits begin.

===Sexual Abuse===
Cartman has also had encounters with sexual abuse. In "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]", Cartman mentions that his mom subjected him to humiliation in a sexual way. He goes on about what he would do if a girl ever threatened to fight him, but instead recounts one such incident.

In "[[Fun with Veal]]", Cartman is awoken by Kyle, Stan and Butters to help save some baby cows from slaughter. As the other boy's knock on his window Cartman gives a scream of "NO UNCLE JESSE, NO!" implying that one of his relatives may have abused him. It could also mean he has a sexual fear of Uncle Jesse from the TV show Full House.

In "[[Cow Days]]", he receives a concussion that makes him think he is a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li, who frequently says "fucky sucky, five dolla" (a reference to Stanley Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket''), to passing male carnival goers. He then "services" Leonardo DiCaprio, much to his disgust after he reverts to his normal self.

In "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", his attempt to find older friends winds up with him almost being molested by members of the [[NAMBLA]].

In "[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]", after discovering that semen will fertilize his sea-people, he goes to a sperm bank to collect "sea-men". At the sperm bank, he pretends to test a semen sample by smearing it on his fingers. When Cartman later empties a bowl of semen into the tank. He then tells Stan and Kyle that he got some of it from a man named Ralph in an alley, who told him to "close his eyes and suck it out of a hose".

In "[[AWESOM-O]]", a movie producer asks Cartman, who is disguised as a robot, if he is a pleasure model. Cartman does not understand him until he takes his pants off, at which point, he runs out yelling in monotone fashion "Lame!" Also, in the episode "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", Cartman convinces Ben Affleck, among others, that his left hand is an actual woman named Jennifer Lopez; Affleck later has a sexual encounter with "Miss Lopez", leaving Cartman's hand covered with his semen.

In "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", Cartman was one of the various victims of [[Snooki]], others being [[DogPoo Petuski]] and [[Stephen Stotch]]. Ironically, after having attacked [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] throughout most of the episode due to his being conceived in New Jersey (as well as being ginger and Jewish), Kyle is the one who saves Cartman from this encounter.

===Religious Beliefs===
In "[[Super Best Friends]]", Cartman converted to [[Blaintology]] along with most of the residents in South Park. When it is revealed that all the Blaintologists are to commit mass suicide in Washington D.C. to further their cause, Cartman becomes overjoyed, even turning on Kyle who did not agree in such an act.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has converted to Judaism and becomes a rabbi, and has a Jewish wife with three children, all of which was met with skeptism from Kyle.

==Family==
The most active family member in Cartman's life is his mother, [[Liane Cartman]]. A recurring joke throughout the series is that, despite his mother's sweetness and wholesome demeanor, she is in fact a promiscuous, oversexed, crack-smoking, scheiße-porn queen, prostitute, and nymphomaniac. Many of these aspects of Liane's personal life are a constant source of annoyance for Cartman, whose friends often mock him over, and which he attempts to fruitlessly deny. An example being when Stan and Kyle continuously stated she was on the cover of "Crack-Whore" magazine in "[[Pinkeye]]". Cartman, attempted to deny this fact, until presented with the magazine itself. He then stated that she had been "young and needed the money", which unfortunately did not work, as Stan and Kyle pointed out that the pictures had been taken just a month ago. Liane constantly dotes over Cartman, doing almost anything he asks and at times even agreeing to his most horrible ideas and plans, such as signing him up for the Special Olympics in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]." The fact Liane allows Cartman to bully and control her is apparently due to extreme loneliness brought up by not have a serious romantic partner and also apparently not having any close friends. She thus desires that Cartman be her 'friend', and will do anything to keep him happy. This unfortunately could explain much of his behavior. It has been implied (at least in earlier episodes) that Liane may be responsible for much of Cartman's racism, anti-semitism and homophobia, as he often was to quote disparaging things that he had supposedly heard her say. For the most part, it seemed that Cartman was perhaps lying or misquoting his mother, except for in "[[Pinkeye]]", in which Liane made Cartman an Adolf Hitler Halloween costume, despite Cartman not knowing who that was at the time.

For over twelve seasons since "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", Cartman lived under the belief that his mother was a hermaphrodite and also his biological father. In "[[200]]" however, Cartman's hand/puppet [[Mitch Conner]] reveals that what Cartman was told was a lie and that Liane was not Cartman's father. After demanding answers out of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]], it is revealed that the paternity tests were altered and one of the people in the room at the time of revelation was indeed Cartman's father. In "[[201]]" it is revealed that Cartman's father is actually [[Jack Tenorman]], a [[Ginger Separatist Movement|ginger]] haired member of [[File:Cartmans Dad And Sister!.jpg|thumb|Cartman's original Dad and Sister]]the [[Denver Broncos]] and father of Cartman's arch-rival [[Scott Tenorman]]. Apparently during the night of the Drunk Barn Dance, Liane proceeded to have sex with assorted men and women; however Jack was the one who impregnated her. Cartman unfortunately never got to meet his father properly, due to the fact that during his war against his half-brother Scott (in which Scott sold Eric his pubes, stating it would allow him to reach maturity), Cartman killed both Jack and his wife, ground their bodies up into ground meat, cooked it in chili and proceeded to feed it to Scott. Cartman does not regret killing his father however, instead is horrified to know that he is half-ginger and thus carries the ginger gene in his body. He was, however, happy when reminded that his father was actually a Denver Bronco.

Cartman's extended family is shown in the episode "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]", where he and the others go on a trip to Nebraska to visit them for Christmas. Most of his relatives appear to be similar in manner to him; all fat, with the same speech accent and catchphrases. The family is seen again in the episode "[[Cartmanland]]", at his grandmother's funeral. Where she leaves her estate (valued at $1,000,000) to Eric, citing that all the other family members would have spent it all on crack.

In the "[[The Unaired Pilot]]" episode, Cartman was shown to have a father and sister, but these characters were cut out in the official pilot. In "[[Le Petit Tourette]]", he accidentally revealed that he cries at night because he does not have a real father.

He has some Dutch and Irish descent, as in "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]", he mentions that his grandmother (Mabel) is Dutch-Irish.

===[[Liane Cartman]]===
[[File:HUMANCENTiPAD021.png|right|thumb|Cartman crying because his mother would not buy him an iPad due to expense and his misbehavior.]]
Liane dotes on her son endlessly, beyond simply spoiling him. Cartman usually gets whatever he wants simply by whining in his signature style. He also frequently insults her in her presence, which she accepts without question. Although Liane possesses a social and moral conscience, Cartman is usually able to manipulate her into doing even morally reprehensible things for him. In "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", Cartman is able to have his mother sign him up for the Special Olympics, even though Cartman was not disabled. It appears that Liane is convinced of her son's goodness and accepts any excuses or stories he makes up, no matter how improbable. The relationship between the two shows a significant change in "[[Tsst]]". To manage Cartman's behavioral issues, she hires [[Cesar Millan]]. Cesar's methods work, and Cartman becomes a normal, good natured, well behaved boy. Liane tries to form a relationship with Cesar, but he turns her down as she is just a client, and she soon begins to spoil Cartman again—as this boy is the closest thing to a friend she really has. However, Liane seems to be one of the only humans whom Cartman genuinely cares about; it was only his much-repressed conscience that kept him from killing her in the same episode. She does not mind doing stuff that is completely gross, as seen in "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", when she takes a bedpan down to the basement where the boys are playing Warcraft and lets Cartman crap into the bedpan that she is holding.. In the later seasons, she has been shown to be strict with him as seen in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", and "[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]" all of which show her not only following through with punishments, but also showing obvious disgust with Cartman's behaviour. Still, despite her taking a more firm stance with Cartman, Liane will still often spoil him, due in large to part to pre-emptively avoid his tantrums as seen in "[[You're Getting Old]]".

Cartman places his mother second on his 'Shit List', seen in "[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]" with Kyle as first on the list. This implies he has a strong hatred for her, however he is defensive of her whenever her promiscuous nature comes into question during earlier seasons, as well as being disturbed during "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]" to discover she was a star in a German pornographic video. With this factored against his outrageous acts against her, it can be seen that he has a strong loathing of her and yet has some form of caring about her at the same time.

===Pets and Toys===
[[File:CartmansMomIsaDirtySlut006.png|thumb|Cartman having a tea party with his dolls in "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]".]]
Cartman has a cat named [[Mr. Kitty]], and a pot-bellied pig named [[Fluffy]] Mr. Kitty and Fluffy have never been seen together in the series thus far. He also has a stuffed frog toy named [[Clyde Frog]]. Other beloved stuffed animals include Wellington Bear (a take on Paddington Bear), Polly Prissypants the rag doll, purple lizard Rumpertumskin (a take on Rumpelstiltskin), and Peter Panda. Cartman nearly always plays with these toys by himself, perhaps out of embarrassment or (just as likely) mean-spiritedness. Occasionally others are allowed to play with him, such as [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]". Cartman's games with these toys can demonstrate his vindictive and cruel nature; one of his games, as seen in aforementioned episode, is "Lambs", in which Cartman reenacts scenes from "The Silence of the Lambs" with his dolls, such as placing a doll in a pit in his basement and then voicing the doll begging to be released while the doll holding it prisoner threatens the pit-bound doll. Often Cartman's games involve the toys telling him how cool and smart he is, and he directs towards them an affection which is not seen towards any other person except his mom. Oddly enough, during one incident in which Cartman's toys were 'praising' him, one of the toys called him a 'fat piece of crap' which was a surprise to Cartman himself. Considering Cartman was voicing the toys, this could imply that a small part of a Cartman despises himself, and that the insult was a subconscious slip. In "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", when a group leaves to conduct a rescue mission, all the group members say goodbye to a person close to each of them, except Cartman who bids farewell to Clyde Frog.

:Cartman: ''"I... don't want you to worry about me."''
:Clyde Frog: "''(Clyde Frog just sits there)"''
:Cartman: "''Hey, you're the best stuffed animal I ever had."''

In the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", although Cartman had given Kyle AIDS as punishment for Kyle laughing at him for having HIV, Kyle angrily breaks many of Cartman's toys in reaction. Among these toys, he rips off Clyde Frog's head. In "[[Dances with Smurfs]]", Clyde Frog is seen on the chalkboard in Cartman's morning announcements implying that Cartman has fixed him.

In "[[1%]]", someone begins destroying Cartman's toys after he was told to grow up. He is seen with a new toy, Muscleman Marc. Clyde Frog is stabbed and nailed to a tree with the word VENGEANCE underneath. Then, Peter Panda is set on fire while Cartman was asleep, which burns his room. Later, Cartman takes them to Token's house, convinced that "black people are incapable of doing anything wrong." The toys soon disappear, leading Cartman to find Muscleman Marc inside a pot of boiling water, and Rumpertumskin chained with a bomb collar, which Cartman inadvertally sets off, blowing its head off. Cartman finds Polly Prissypants in a chair, with a revolver. The act is dropped when we see Cartman voicing Polly as she "confesses" to the murders, claiming that the others were right, that Cartman had to grow up. So she killed the other toys and planned on framing Token, but Cartman reminds her that because of Obama, black people cannot be blamed. In desperation, Polly asks Cartman to kill her, which he reluctantly does. The other boys watched, and realized that this was Cartman's delusional way of getting rid of his stuffed animals.
====Cats====
Cartman, though incapable of empathy towards people, exhibits a strong bond with cats despite being a speciesist. In "[[Major Boobage]]", cats are made illegal because Kenny, along with several other kids around the country, begins using male cat musk as a hallucinogenic drug. Cartman lies to the police, claiming that he had his cat put down when he really is hiding his cat in the attic. Throughout the episode he collects abandoned cats in his attic out of sympathy. His cat has been on the show since the series began, and his love for cats could have developed from his lack of other family members besides his mother; he has no father or siblings. This empathetic relationship is reserved for cats and not humans; he does not (or more likely chooses not to) recognize a parallel between his cat safe-haven to the history of Jews hiding from Nazi soldiers during the Holocaust, which Kyle points out.

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
[[File:ThePoorKid026.png|thumb|Cartman angry at Kyle.]]
The rivalry between Cartman and Kyle has been a recurring theme from the beginning, but has become significantly stronger since [[Season Four]]. Cartman appears to have a very strong hatred for Kyle, and shows that he has no tolerance for Kyle's Jewish faith. Kyle hates him in turn. However, neither one of them seems to realize the effects of their almost poisonous relationship, and continue to live in close contact with each other.

In [[Season Five]], Cartman and Kyle's relationship meets a turning point, going from a relationship of them simply ripping on each other constantly to near hatred simply because Cartman [[Kenny Dies|caused Kenny's semi-permanent death]]. It was around [[Season Eleven]] that they began their descent from love-hate to full on hatred.

However, in the "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", during the scene where Cartman has Butters apologize to all of his peers in his stead (as he believes he is a ghost), he seems to wish to recant some of his earlier misdeeds towards Kyle (and obtain his forgiveness), and seems genuinely moved upon seeing him.

Kyle is often put in the shoes of the protagonist to Eric Cartman's antagonist. For example, in "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]", the two of them work against each other; when Cartman tries to get [[Family Guy]] canceled, Kyle tries to stop him. The two of them often have arguments about morals, like in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", where Cartman decides to pretend to be mentally handicapped so he can win the "Special Olympics".

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', when they were facing certain death, Cartman tried to atone for all the times he called Kyle "A big dumb Jew", telling him "''I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew''". Bewildered, Kyle replies that he is indeed a Jew, and Cartman tells him not to be so hard on himself (implying that Jew was an insult rather than a religion).

Cartman also has attempted to murder Kyle more than once, the most significant incident being in a scene from "[[Toilet Paper]]" in which he lures Kyle into going rowing with him to the middle of [[Stark's Pond]], and then, when Kyle's back is turned, attempts to bludgeon him to death with a wiffle bat, without comprehending the stupidity of the plan. When he learns someone has confessed to the crime he, Kyle, Stan and Kenny had committed, thus eliminating the need to kill Kyle who was going to confess himself, Cartman asks Stan (in his usual trademark-pathetic way) if he can still kill Kyle. Cartman tries to murder Kyle again in "[[Fatbeard]]".

However, in "[[Smug Alert!]]", Cartman saves Kyle and his family when a large storm is about to go towards their house in San Francisco. Cartman finds Butters as too boring a nemesis since he will simply accept anything Cartman directs at him, and realizes that in order to have someone with which to argue incessantly again he must get Kyle back. At the end of the episode he hides the fact that he was the savior of Kyle's whole family, opting to insult Kyle again instead; Kyle replies angrily and storms off, to Cartman's satisfaction. In the episode "[[Le Petit Tourette]]" when Kyle (unintentionally) saves Cartman from shouting out all his secrets on Dateline (Cartman had originally intended to use fake Tourette's so as to deliver a hate-speech against Jews), Cartman hugs Kyle and thanks him, even saying "I love you, man." In the episode "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]", when Kyle falls into a cavern and asks from the bottom, "''Is Cartman there?''" he responds with a sincere "''I'm here, Kyle!''". Of course this only occurs after Cartman suggests they leave Kyle for dead and continue to their search for crocodiles. In the episode "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", Cartman defends Kyle saying, "Broflovski's a good cop!"

Cartman's obsessive hatred of Kyle above almost all others, has called into question Cartman's deeper feeling for Kyle. In the episode "[[Imaginationland]]", Cartman wins a bet with Kyle which requires Kyle to suck his balls, and goes to various extreme measures throughout the Imaginationland trilogy to make Kyle do so, including going to the Supreme Court and breaking into the Pentagon (twice). In the end of the trilogy's first part, Cartman is seen with a photo of an innocent looking Kyle. The scene ends with Cartman dragging his finger slowly across Kyle's mouth in the photo, which could be interpreted as an act of lust, this further hints at a confused sexuality. At the end of the trilogy's third part, Cartman conjures up an imaginary Kyle to suck the balls of an imaginary Cartman.

Cartman also, in the episode "[[Go God Go XII]]", offers to suck Kyle's balls (after Kyle said "Suck my balls, Cartman"), in exchange for Kyle's help in getting Cartman back from the distant future. In the episode "[[Fatbeard]]", Kyle encourages Cartman to run away to [[Somalia]], hoping that he will die. Cartman also seems to have no qualms about seriously invading Kyle's personal space, as shown in a scene from "[[Manbearpig]]" wherein Cartman, while contemplating his hatred for Kyle, looms a mere inch or two from Kyle's face as he sleeps; soon Kyle wakes up and yells, "''Dude, get away from me!''"

However, the fact that Kyle challenges Cartman more than any other character in the series, may in fact be the core reason for Cartman's obsessive fixation on him. In "[[Fatbeard]]", he says that Kyle has "finally come to terms with his disability" and seemed more willing to kill Kyle later in the episode by making his walk the plank over an alligator. As of "[[Dead Celebrities]]", he seems to be more passive toward Kyle, greeting him with only " 'Sup, Jew?". This passive attitude however seemed to be only temporary, as seen in "[[Crippled Summer]]", in which during [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]]'s intervention on national TV, each of the boys is asked to read a pre-written statement about their feelings for Towelie. Cartman however instead reads off a long-winded hate speech against the Jewish people (most likely the one he intended to use during "[[Le Petit Tourette]]"), where he urges the rest of the country to help him in rising up against the Jews and in which most of his speech is directed primarily towards Kyle.

The two have occasionally gotten along such as in "[[Kenny Dies]]" and "[[Pinkeye]]" when Kyle put his hand on Cartman's shoulder when was upset about Kenny dying. In fact, in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]", Cartman helped Kyle make new friends, even though Cartman did not appear to be gaining anything out of it. In "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", Kyle was ironically the one who saved Cartman when he was being raped by [[Snooki]]. Cartman showed genuine appreciation for this act, thanking him and later going as far as to say that although Kyle was a "monster" (for having Jersey blood running through his veins), he was "my [Cartman's] little monster", and pinched his cheek. Although they bicker constantly, the two have not full on fought since then, and have had a lot more moments together where they seem happy, such as Kyle sharing music with Cartman in "[[You're Getting Old]]". There are also moments such as in "[[Faith Hilling]]" where the two share a common goal. However, there are many moments where they are at ends like earlier in the series, such as in the Coon trilogy. Therefore, their friendship is in a constant state of disrepair.

The back-and-forth of their outward conflict yet still regularly meeting with the other boys can be seen as somewhat ironic. Therefore, Kyle and Cartman could be seen to have a more complex connection than Stan and Kyle with . In [[The Entity|"The Entity"]], Kyle described Cartman as "my sort of friend-ish", as his best explanation of their relationship.

In "[[You're Getting Old]]", Stan's behavior change upon turning 10 causes a rift to develop occurs in his friendships with Kyle, Cartman and Kenny to the point where they no longer wish to interact with him. As a result, at the episode's end with Cartman and Kyle playing video games together, the pair offer each other kind smiles, showing their friendship growing even further.

In "[[Ass Burgers]]", Kyle and Cartman have quite a few friendly moments together. Although they are shown bickering, the argument is not angry as most of the arguments between the two can be. Kyle is quick to support Cartman in his new business, even going so far as to tell Stan that they ca not be friends anymore because he is with Cartman Burgers now. When Stan shows up, drunk, talking to Kyle, it is shown that Cartman is keeping a close eye on them from where he was standing. He even eventually comes over to check if Kyle is okay, giving Stan a distasteful look. However, this is rapidly tarnished by the episode's end when Kyle discovers his method for producing his burgers.

In "[[Jewpacabra]]", Cartman constantly rips on Jews throughout the episode, even to the point of making up a Jewish creatures that eats children in Easter egg hunts. When Cartman believes that the creature could be real and is chained so the creature can eat him, he is tranquilized and is hazed. Kyle finds him and takes him home and puts him to bed. The next day, at the [[Sooper Foods]] Easter egg hunt, Cartman claims that he is Jewish and knows how Kyle feels.

===[[Stan Marsh]] ===
Cartman and Stan's friendship is clearly existent but it is very tense. In fact, when Kyle and Kenny are not around, he and Stan often do not show a close friendship with each other or rarely interact one-on-one.

In "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", Stan and Cartman hang out at the boating rack, and Cartman even comments that it is great that they are hanging out with each other without Kyle, to which Stan does not disagree to, implying that Stan somewhat shares these feelings. Stan also agrees with Cartman in the episode, such as not telling Kyle he caused the dam to break, and not telling [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] he was the one who broke the dam.

Cartman's song "[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]" was joined by all the other classmates (minus Kyle of course), even getting Stan's attention in which Stan actually enjoys the song.

In "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", while Kyle is immediately distrustful of Cartman's claim that he cannot control the actions of his hand (which has seemed to take on a life of its own), Stan gives Cartman the benefit of the doubt and admits that, with all the stuff that happens in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], Cartman could be telling the truth. Cartman and Stan were also seen interacting one on one in "[[Sexual Healing]]" when Kyle, Kenny and Butters were away at the Karne Institute for Sex Addicts and they were playing with each other on the domestic violence/golf video game [[Tiger Woods|Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2011]] at Cartman's house and they were getting along just fine with no arguments. When the boys were playing street hockey in "[[Grey Dawn]]", Stan was the only one he did not insult, referring to him as "Marsh", as any commentator would, as opposed to Kyle and Kenny, who he referred to as "the Jew" and "the Poor Kid", respectively.

In "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]", Cartman made Stan the protagonist of his Christmas story (he is described as 'the boy in a red poof-ball hat'). Everyone but Kyle likes the story, including Stan. The fact that Stan is portrayed normally in the Christmas story hints that Stan is Cartman's friend, unlike Kyle, who is portrayed as evil. In "[[Douche and Turd]]", Stan votes for Cartman's mascot instead of Kyle's, much to Kyle's dismay. Also, in the episode "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]", when Stan appears to be the only boy who has not gotten their period, Cartman reassures him that he will get it one day. However, in "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]", Cartman declares that he hates Stan because Stan loves animals. Even so, in the episode "[[Trapped in the Closet]]", all three boys de-friend Stan after he becomes the leader of Scientology. As the boys leave, Cartman turns to Stan and says, "''I still hate Kyle more than you''". In "[[Fun with Veal]]", when Cartman was negotiating for weapons and an escape route for him and the rest of the boys, he is at first reluctant to meet the demands of [[Glen Dumont|the timid FBI negotiator]], but soon agreed to his conditions when he looked at Stan and recognized the sores (which were actually mini-vaginas) on his body and his deteriorating health. This implies that Cartman cares about Stan's well-being to an extent. Another reference to their friendship is in "[[Pee]]" when Cartman notices that Kyle, Stan, Butters and Jimmy are still alive he instantly hugs Stan, running past Kyle.

In some episodes Stan is shown having a strong hatred for Cartman even if Cartman is not doing anything. In "[[Trapper Keeper]]" when the cyborg says he has to kill Cartman, Stan asks if he can do it, and prepares to shoot Cartman before the cyborg decides against the idea. In "[[Spookyfish]]" Stan is fully for sending Cartman away forever. Although Stan is much more tolerant of Cartman than Kyle is, he often holds Cartman in very high contempt for his unacceptable behaviour. In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", when Mr. Mackey claimed that Cartman killed himself for being fat when the school faculty "threw him under the bus", Stan was only concerned with preventing Eavesdropper from publishing the biggest story.

In "[[You're Getting Old]]", Cartman ends his friendship with Stan rather quickly after Stan's personality change, and soon begins getting along better Kyle, who also ends his friendship with Stan. Though, they did become friends again in "[[Ass Burgers]]".

===[[Kenny McCormick]]===
[[File:KennyDies043.png|thumb|Cartman cries outside of Kenny's hospital room.]]
Because of Cartman's selfish personality, his friendship with Kenny is not as obvious as Stan and Kyle's, and it sometimes looks fake, but it is clearly existent. They are also shown to share a sense of humor, as can be seen in the episode "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]" when Kenny and Cartman continue an elaborate joke, despite Stan and Kyle's objections.

However, Cartman has at times displayed a special dislike for Kenny, often without any reason; most often, he shows contempt for Kenny's family living in poverty. In two separate episodes, "[[Chickenpox]]" and "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", Cartman is heard singing the song "[[In the Ghetto|In The Ghetto]]" in order to tease Kenny. In "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]", Kenny and Cartman are alone in the scene, and Cartman blurts out "I hate you, Kenny" out of nowhere. In the episode "[[Jakovasaurs]]", Cartman makes up a song called "I Hate You Guys" where he sings:<br />
:''"I hate you guys / you guys are assholes / especially Kenny / I hate him the most"''.
In the episode "[[Lice Capades]]" he attempts make Kenny a scapegoat for his lice problem (not realizing everyone had lice), and upon "proving" Kenny's guilt with an elaborate, phony experiment, Cartman then organizes a cruel "sock bath" hazing ritual for Kenny - continuing with it even after [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] reveals that everyone had lice. In the earlier seasons, Kenny was often painted as Cartman's much abused sidekick, although this role has been filled by Butters since [[Season Six]].

It is possible that Kenny is Cartman's only real friend and he does not understand how to react to having such a friend, or the opposite since Stan and Kyle at some points have stated that Kenny is not really their friend and that they do not give a crap about him (although this is usually whenever they want to avoid him for some reason, such as [[Chickenpox|when he had chickenpox]]). In the episode, "[[Kenny Dies]]", Cartman proclaims that Kenny is his best friend among the three boys, but at the end of the episode it is implied that Cartman is Kenny's "worst friend" since he exploited Kenny's illness for personal gain. However, he had cried over Kenny's illness before discovering the possibility of making his own "Shakeys".

Kenny has generally taken Cartman's side in arguments or when they do things. Cartman is also the only person who seems to take Kenny's deaths seriously. In the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[The Succubus]]", when he cannot see Kenny (who was crushed seconds earlier) he calls out "Guys? Is Kenny okay?", showing that he might consider Kenny a close friend. Cartman is also the only person who seems to realize he dies more than once. In "[[Cartmanland]]" Cartman says "He dies all the time" and brushes his death off easily because he will come back tomorrow. In "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]", Cartman is telling a story and has Kenny dying at the end, even though Kenny had died minutes before by being eaten by the giant black monster outside the bus. Kyle points out to him that Kenny dying twice would be impossible and Cartman goes along with it noticing the logic. This may show that Cartman is immune to whatever keeps everyone else blinded by the fact that Kenny repeatedly dies.

In the episode "[[Best Friends Forever]]", Kenny states in his will that he felt sorry for Cartman because of his inability to feel compassion and empathy, and the fact that he will almost certainly end up bitter, miserable, and alone for the rest of his life. Also, in the episode "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]", the two are shown playing with spaceships without Stan or Kyle (although Kyle was dying at the time). And in the episode, "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", when Cartman drinks Kenny's ashes mistaking them for chocolate milk, leaving Kenny's soul trapped in his body, until the episode "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]". Kenny also chooses to appear to Cartman as opposed to Stan or Kyle in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', although this might be because it was Cartman's fault he died, However he was actually trying to warn and have him tell everyone about [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam's]] and [[Satan|Satan's]] plan for world domination. In "[[Cartmanland]]", Cartman is shown to be aware of Kenny's deaths telling the IRS that Kenny "dies all the time". Kenny was the only one out of the four main boys (excluding [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) to enter his theme park, as well as the only one offered a spot in Cartman's southern army. At the end of the episode "[[Pinkeye]]", Cartman was the only one sobbing over Kenny's death. In fact, Cartman even showed a little concern for Kenny when he found out his new girlfriend was a whore in "[[The Ring]]". In the episode "[[Chinpokomon]]", after Kenny has a seizure and is rendered unresponsive after playing the Chinpokomon video game, Cartman was the only one of the three who seemed to notice that rats were swarming over Kenny and attempting to eat him, and the only one to detach them, telling them, "''Bad rats, he isn't dead yet!''", and unlike Stan and Kyle (who immediately laughed), he was initially disgusted when it was discovered the rats had actually eaten him from the inside out, before proceeding to laugh. Also in the episode "[[Butt Out]]", he noticed that Kenny was eating his own hand out of boredom. Whilst he did nothing, he still mentioned it to the boys as if to say 'should we help him?' Kenny also aided Cartman in his escape when Cartman was charged with hate crimes.

However, ever since Cartman (unwittingly) made Kenny cry in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", their friendship has not been as strong - even after everyone stopped giving Cartman the silent treatment, their friendship did not fully recover. In particular, in the episode "[[Poor and Stupid]]", Kenny is shown to value [[NASCAR]] more than his friendship with Cartman, who was ruining NASCAR's image. Kenny even went as far as to try to kill Cartman with a sniper rifle, but this was confiscated. Eventually when he lost the race to [[Patty Hamill|Patty]], Cartman apologized to him for his behavior - a rare event indeed - and Kenny (most likely) forgave Cartman. Later, in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", Cartman used his new friend, the Dark God [[Cthulhu]], to banish Kenny, along with several others, to an "evil and parallel dimension". When Kenny caught up with Cartman - who was in the process of massacring a [[Justin Bieber]] concert - Cartman showed no remorse, and the two ended up in a heated argument.

However, in "[[You're Getting Old]]", Cartman and Kenny are getting along fine once again, and spend that episode being friendly and hanging out with each other. In [[A Song of Ass and Fire]], there is a picture of Cartman and Kenny sitting next to each other at [[Casa Bonita]], even though Cartman slams down the photo because Kenny 'betrayed' him by switching to PlayStation 4 instead of sticking with Xbox 1. Kenny does not take part in smashing Eric's electronics in "[[Skank Hunt]]".

===[[Butters Stotch]]===
[[File:SuperFunTime103.png|thumb|left|Cartman and Butters suffer great injuries together during "[[Super Fun Time]]".]]
Butters has become Cartman's most frequent victim. Butters sees Cartman as his good friend and treats him as so but in later episodes he treats Cartman the same as everybody else. But, Cartman takes advantage of this and finds Butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view, or get him to do what he wants. In "[[Douche and Turd]]" Cartman easily gets Butters to vote for his idea of a "turd sandwich" simply by describing the candidates in a certain way. In "[[Go God Go]]" he gets Butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the Wii video game console.

In many episodes entire plots are centered on Cartman's antics against Butters. In "[[Casa Bonita]]", Cartman faked an apocalypse so Butters would hide in a bomb shelter for over a week, so Cartman could go with Kyle, Stan, and Kenny to Casa Bonita instead of Butters. In "[[AWESOM-O]]" he dressed as a robot to trick Butters, but in the end this failed miserably and Butters happily showed a tape of Cartman dressed like Britney Spears in front of everyone for revenge. In the episode "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", Butters does another one at Cartman while he is beaten down by Token, by farting on his face giving him the finger while saying "fuck you Eric", for his repeated blasphemy and ruining their band. He also taunts Cartman for being the real 'ugliest' kid in their class and mocks his neo-Nazism in a deleted scene in the episode "[[The List]]".

In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]" all of the kids at [[South Park Elementary]] decide to ignore Cartman because they feel he is a "son of a bitch". Unlike the other boys, Butters is not aware of the plan and Cartman believes that Butters is the only one who can see him, now that he is "dead". In "[[Cartman Sucks]]" he repeatedly invited Butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him, until it backfired on him and he made an inappropriate picture which featured him putting Butter's penis in his mouth, and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class, humiliating Cartman instead of Butters. In the episode "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", after Cartman gets brutalized by [[Wendy]], Butters agreed with [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] that he always hated Cartman with everyone else. However, "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]", Cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards Butters after he is queefed upon, and even gives him a present, as well as participating in a state-wide attempt to ban queefing with Butters as a mascot, suggesting some compassion for Butters although he, like the others, refuses to go near Butters after he was queefed on. Cartman also "punishes" Butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", though later he would praise Butters for kissing a girl for 5 bucks. In the episode "[[Pee]]" when everybody is rescued Butters is disappointed that Cartman did not die.

Cartman has the tendency to pull pranks on Butters while he is asleep. This is most apparent in "[[Asspen]]" and "[[Cartman Sucks]]". One of which is to place a warm glass of water under Butter's hand and then urinate on him. Also in "[[Jared Has Aides]]" while [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] got grounded by his parents, Cartman decided to cover for Butters while Stan and Kyle tried to get 4 million dollars when Butters' parents told him they would call him on the phone every hour.

===[[Heidi Turner]]===
In "[[Follow That Egg!]]", Cartman was assigned and paired up with Heidi to take of an egg for a school assignment, later when Cartman broke the egg he begged [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]] to give her an "A" and give him an "F", this could possibly prove that Cartman cares and has feelings for her, however in later episodes it does not show much of them having a relationship. It is also likely that he said this to get a better grade, because the A and F average out to a C, whereas two F's would mean Cartman failed.

In "[[The Damned]]", Heidi Turner and Cartman form a relationship when she gives him a glimpse of life outside social media. Following that, in "[[Wieners Out]]", it is revealed by Cartman the two are now a couple and he claims to be wiser from the experience.

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", they both work together to help Denmark put an end to internet trolling. They even sing "[[Let's Come Together As a School]]" in a vain attempt to unify the boys and girls at [[South Park Elementary]].

In "[[Fort Collins]]", Cartman is unable to tell Heidi about his past bigotry, out of fear of being dumped. He lies to her and blames the incidents on [[Jimmy Valmer]]. In order to further prevent the truth from coming out, the two journey to [[SpaceX]] in "[[Oh, Jeez]]" to get to [[Mars]]. 

Focused on her "Emoji Analysis" in "[[Not Funny]]", Heidi begins to focus more on her work, rather than Cartman. Cartman laments to Butters about this, who tries to convince him that Heidi will "leave poop on his heart".

At the end of [[Season Twenty]], in "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]", Heidi and Eric stay together, although Eric is disappointed in her.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]", their relationship becomes stained. Cartman begins to be annoyed with Heidi for not being submissive to him. He blames her for his unhappiness in their relationship, accusing her of being mentally abusive. At the end of the episode, Cartman breaks up with Heidi, and leaves her heartbroken. Despite this, it is revealed in the following episode, "[[Put It Down]]", that Cartman truly does love Heidi, as he leaves Heidi a voicemail, threatening her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back. Worried about him, Heidi accepts this, and they get back together.

The toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Sons A Witches]]". In the episode, Cartman grows frustrated with Heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together. Instead of telling her how he felt, he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt he'd feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that “Heidi is a nice girl”, and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly. Cartman dismisses this, and later he convinces Heidi to dress up as Gretel, while dressing himself up as Hansel. Immediately after he takes Heidi into the woods with him at night, and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die, and gets her kidnapped by a witch. She is rescued at the end of the episode, much to Cartman's dismay.

Their relationship plays its most significant role to date in the seventh episode of Season Twenty-One. It was revealed in the episode, "Doubling Down", that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are directly influenced by the other girls, who laugh at her, and tease her for ever dating him, albeit playfully. They also expressed concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. Kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. After breaking up with Cartman, Heidi agrees to be Kyle's girlfriend, angering Cartman. Cartman recognizes Heidi's confusion about what she wants, and uses this to manipulate her into betraying her healthy diet, and contort her beliefs, making her unintentionally prejudice against Jews.

===[[Wendy Testaburger]]===
Cartman is known to taunt Wendy for her liberal and environmentalist views, and often refers to her as a hippie or a tree hugger. However, in "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", after they were working together on the flag debate, he entertained her by talking through two action figures. During this encounter, they found out that they had a lot in common with each other. When Wendy kissed him at the presentation to get her emotions out of her system, he was pleased and facially bragged to Stan about it. He later seemed dejected when Wendy told him her feelings for him were gone which obviously proved he fancied her. It is believed his taunting of her is his way of "pulling pigtails".

[[File:ChefGoesNanners082.png|thumb|Wendy kissing Cartman.]]
In "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", after Wendy grows adult-sized breasts Cartman and the other boys laugh at her and Cartman calls her a "stupid bitch."

In the episode "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", Cartman treats Wendy's plea for breast cancer awareness as a joke, and subsequently she beats him up, leaving him in a pool of his own blood.

Despite this, Cartman may still have a sexual attraction to Wendy seen in Cartman's inaccurate flashbacks and imaginations in "[[Fishsticks]]": when Cartman "killed a dragon" and "saved South Park from the Jew-Bots" as Wendy showers him in praise as he basks in it.

Cartman seems to grow more hate and always assaults Wendy when he gets any chance in "[[Dances with Smurfs]]" as he may still hold a grudge against Wendy after being beaten up by her in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]] ".

Cartman is the only one to say greet Wendy in "[[Pinkeye]]" when she meets up with the others to go trick-or-treating, and says it in a nice tone. However, Cartman could have liked the fact that Wendy humiliated Stan.

In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", Cartman says that Wendy has huge boobs; this could be him trying to impress her by saying she looks attractive. Also, this is one episode after "[[Chef Goes Nanners|Chef goes Nanners]]", which is when Wendy kissed Cartman, implying that Cartman still likes Wendy.

Wendy and Cartman have both killed people, and both have made psychotic and sadistic faces and actions; in "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]", Wendy watches [[Ms. Ellen]] get rocketed into the sun and says in a sweet, creepy voice, "Bye - bye Ms. Ellen", then puts then on a smiling, psychoeyed face saying, "Don't. Fuck. With. Wendy. TESTABURGER!"; In "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", Cartman had informed Scott Tenorman of his parents' death with a smile and a creepy voice; he also taunts him, saying, "Na na na na na na, I made you eat your parents, Na na na na na na."; Cartman then licks Scotts tears saying, "Let me lick your tears Scott. MMM, they're so yummy and sweet. The tears of unfathomable sadness. MMM, yummy, yummy you guys.". This shows that the two are alike in mental health; homicidal and sadistic, which could be something for them to bond over.

In "[[The Cissy]]", Wendy uses the transgender bathroom to get back at him.

===[[Chef]] ===
Although Cartman does not generally like anyone in particular, he was very fond of Chef, as seen in "[[The Return of Chef]]" where Cartman was crying in front of Butters and even admitted that he was going to miss Chef, but did not know how to tell him. He normally used to go to Chef with his problems, and Chef was always willing to help him. Chef even helped Cartman get Kenny's soul out of his body, before it killed him.

However, when Cartman was creating a crew to free the town from the hippies, he chose Chef as the black man to sacrifice himself later. It should be noted that before Cartman found out that Liane was his father, he had been told that Chef was his father. And despite Chef's willingness to help Cartman, he like everyone else in town, is more than willing to insult Cartman and call him fat.

===[[Craig Tucker]]===
Throughout the series, Cartman shows a special dislike for Craig. He usually tries to prove Craig wrong and annoy him. In many episodes Craig competes against Cartman and shows satisfaction when he has advantages. This can be seen "[[Quest for Ratings]]" or "[[South Park is Gay!]]", where Cartman declares wrathfully "God, I hate Craig! That son of a bitch!". In another episode Cartman tries to go to Craig when runs from home, but Craig tells him he hates him and shuts the door in his face. However, whenever all the boys join forces for a common cause, such as in "[[Marjorine]]", "[[Imaginationland]]" or "[[The List]]", Craig is usually Cartman's right-hand man. In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", Cartman trained Craig in sumo wrestling. In "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", Cartman is the most excited in showing off their weapons to Craig. In "Skank Hunt", he along with Stan, Kyle, Butters, Clyde, Jimmy and Token smash Cartman's electronics due to them thinking that he is Skankhunt42.

===[[Clyde Donovan]]===
Ever since "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", Clyde seems to show great respect for Cartman, since he went through everyone calling him a fat ass. Everyone seems to be shocked whenever Clyde stands up for Cartman, especially Cartman (one example was in "[[Marjorine]]"). Clyde joined Cartman's pirate crew in "[[Fatbeard]]". He is also always in Cartman's groups whenever Cartman assembles a group against other enemies. In "[[You Have 0 Friends]]", he invited Cartman to participate in his birthday party at "Casa Bonita". After watching the [[Terrance and Phillip]] commercial in the episode "[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]", he immediately calls Clyde and goes to his house to watch it again. Furthermore, in [[You Have 0 Friends]], Cartman encourages people to add Clyde as a friend on [[Facebook]]. However, in "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", Clyde is reluctant to join the Cartman-led attack on the [[Jenkins|the griefer]], and ultimately no-shows as he is more preoccupied looking at a ''Playboy'' centerfold than playing the game. Cartman also once slingshotted Clyde in the balls for his own (and, as he later defended his actions in "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", [[Token]]'s) amusement. In "[[Skank Hunt]]" Clyde joins Stan, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy, Craig and Token to smash all of Cartman's electronics due them think that he is [[Skankhunt42]].

It appears that Cartman has a strong hatred for Clyde, as shown by his "Shit List" in "[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]" where he placed Clyde 3rd for his most hated person, after Kyle and Liane Cartman respectively.
===[[Token Black]]===
Cartman has a mixed relationship with Token Black, although it is mostly negative, displayed by his use of stereotypes and general, reoccurring meanness to him. Token really hates Cartman because he is generally racist toward numerous minority groups, including black people. In "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", when Token constantly mocks Cartman about his weight, and Kyle after provokes him, Cartman throws a rock Token. However, after being released from prison and after winning the race against the girls, Cartman vows to never take his friends for granted again, much to Token's delight, who starts to warm up to him. In "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", Cartman makes fun of him because he is rich and wealthy. In "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", Cartman got beat up by Token after he wasted money that they made and scared their crowd away; he also racially insinuated that Token could play bass guitar on the grounds that he was black, which turned out to be true. Him, Butters and Token have their own album, <span>[[Faith + 1 (Album)|Faith + 1]]</span>. In "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", Cartman remorsefully apologizes to Token for ripping on him for being black (thinking that he was a ghost and does not realize that he was being ignored at the time). In "[[1%]]", Cartman hides in Token's house, thinking that he will be safe from any assaults because Token is black. In "[[Cartman Finds Love]]", Cartman repeatedly worked to ensure that Token and [[Nichole]] became a couple, on the grounds that, in his words "blacks belong together". In "[[Skank Hunt]]", he joins Stan, Kyle, Butters, Token, Jimmy, Craig and Clyde to smash Eric Cartman's electronics.
===[[Bebe Stevens]]===
Wendy's best friend, Bebe, often shows hatred for Cartman, as he does for her. In "[[Raisins]]", Bebe tells Stan that Wendy wants to break up with Stan, leading to a heated argument between Cartman and Bebe, Cartman calls Bebe a whore numerous times to which Bebe calls Cartman a fat ass. In "[[The Ungroundable]]" at the beginning of the episode, all of the kids are seen playing Call of Duty: World At War. Cartman is shot and killed by someone within the game and he says, "''Ah! Who just shot me?!''", and Bebe leans away from her computer and flips Cartman off, saying that she killed him within the game, when Cartman's character respawns, he immediately attacks Bebe and refers to her as a "bitch". Also, in "[[The List]]", When Bebe refused to give him the list, Cartman says: "''Fuck you, Bebe! Fucking bitch!''". He also disagress with Bebe about farts in "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]". In "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", Cartman role plays "[[wikipedia: Silence of the Lambs|Silence of the Lambs]]" with his dolls with Bebe. The two get on well together, although this was only due to her breasts.

===[[Patty Nelson]]===
In "[[Le Petit Tourette]]", when Cartman's fake Tourette's become real, he reveals to everyone that he is in love with Patty Nelson, and that he fantasizes kissing her. Upon hearing this however, Patty Nelson looks horrified as she mutters "Eww...".
===[[Jimmy Valmer]]===
Jimmy is one of the kids that Cartman have manipulated sometimes, and sometimes becomes his rival in "[[Craig's Gang]]". However, Jimmy seems to be one of the few people that Cartman respects and is willing to do good deeds for. As shown in many episodes, he enjoys Jimmy's comedy and often goes to him whenever he needs advice. He was even willing to sacrifice himself to save Jimmy in "[[Fishsticks]]". Even though this was because Cartman believed he wrote Jimmy's joke and was in a way trying to take credit, the fact that he was willing to sacrifice himself to [[Kanye West]] to save Jimmy, this is still very noteworthy as one of the few times Cartman did a good deed without being promised anything in return. Jimmy also sometimes go to Cartman for advice, such as when Cartman helped Jimmy with his love life in "[[Erection Day]]". When he thought he lost his sense of humor in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]" he goes to Jimmy for help. However Cartman beats Jimmy up in [[Casa Bonita|"Casa Bonita]]" in an attempt to gain Kyle's friendship even though Jimmy was trying to help Cartman.
===[[Ike Broflovski]]===
[[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] has been shown working with Cartman on occasion, and is the only Jew that Cartman does not seem to discriminate against (although it is possible he does not know he is Jewish, which is unlikely due to events in "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"). In the earlier seasons, Cartman seemed either indifferent or hostile to Ike, although recently he has started to work with him more. Ike joined Cartman's crew in "[[Fatbeard]]", and was the only Jew in the crew. He acted as Cartman's right-hand man and second in command, Cartman usually going to him when he needed something done.
===[[Mr. Jefferson|Michael Jackson]]===
Cartman is probably the only friend he has, Cartman and Jackson have a very good relationship together. In Stan's house when they were sleeping, he was sleeping next to him. Cartman also wanted to have a slumber party in his house. He also told everyone about Mr. Jefferson. All this occurs in "[[The Jeffersons]]".

Despite their previous friendship, he seemed to resent his presence in "[[Dead Celebrities]]" when he possessed Ike and may not have recognized him. Cartman was later seen with the rest of the boys cheering for him at the pageant and bribed the judge in order for him to win.
===[[Billy Mays]]===
In "[[Dead Celebrities]]" Cartman shows surprising respect and loyalty to Billy Mays for introducing him to the product [[Chipotlaway]], which allows him to continue eating at Chipotle despite the fact that it causes blood to stain his underwear. Throughout the entire episode, Cartman is motivated solely by his desire to put Billy Mays' soul to rest, never once expressing any intention to gain anything from this endeavor in the process. Even at the end of the episode, by which time Cartman usually reveals his ulterior motive(s), Cartman still focuses on the fact that Billy Mays is at peace.

===[[Romper Stomper]] ===
Cartman seems to have formed a genuine friendship with his cell-mate while he was in prison in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" after Romper Stomper showed compassion to him when he was seen crying. Though Cartman seems to have held him little regard (as evidenced from when he attempted to run away from the prison while Romper-Stomper suffered an injury and stayed behind), he appears to have genuinely appreciated Romper-Stomper's help. After Cartman was released from prison, he visited Romper-Stomper again and pooped Disneyland (the place Romper-Stomper had always wanted to see) into the toilet for him with nothing to gain from it. In addition to his relationship with Billy Mays and [[Shelly Marsh]], Romper-Stomper is one of the few people which Cartman has done a good deed for without being promised anything in return.

===[[Scott Tenorman]]===
Scott Tenorman is Cartman's half-brother and nemesis. Their first meeting was in [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|"Scott Tenorman Must Die"]], in which Scott sold Cartman his pubic hair, convincing Cartman it would signify maturity for him. When Cartman realized the truth, he then proceeded to attempt several fruitless revenge plots, until at last he created an elaborate scheme in which he had their father [[Jack Tenorman|Jack]], and [[Mrs. Tenorman]] killed, ground up into Chili and fed to Scott. This event drove Scott insane, and during his time in a mental institution he plotted his revenge. They met again in "[[201]]", in which Scott resurrected the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]] that Cartman created, as part of a complicated plan to get revenge on Cartman by revealing who his real father was. After capturing Cartman and all the surviving possible fathers of South Park and [[Liane Cartman]], Scott revealed that Cartman's father was a member of the [[Denver Broncos]], but that the town covered up the truth because they did not want to ruin the Bronco's season by spreading knowledge of an illegitimate child scandal. Scott then explains that his own father was a member of the Broncos, and the only one who lived in South Park. Cartman is horrified to learn that Scott's father was also his father. After feeding Cartman tainted chili, Scott escapes capture by means of a jet-pack. Scott's plan works however, in that Cartman is left in tears, not because his father is dead however, but because he is half-ginger.

===[[Shelly Marsh]]===
Shelly babysits Cartman in "[[Cat Orgy]]", after his mom goes off to attend the Meteor Shower party. At first they are displeased with each other's presence, but then they appear to get along near the end. In fact, Cartman comforts Shelly when she feels insecure about her appearance and feels that no one likes her. Cartman tells her that he does not think she is ugly, which makes Shelly feel better. And they become friends after Cartman convinces her to dump her boyfriend Skyler deeming him a jerk.

In "[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]", when Shelly walks in the living room and changes the channel while the boys are watching TV, Cartman tries to manipulate Shelly into letting the boys continue watching by telling her that he thinks she is hot. Shelly is visibly angered by this remark.
===Social Standing in General===
Most people at school regularly and openly despise and hate Cartman for being selfish and mean spirited, also mocking him for his weight (which has lead Cartman to be extremely insecure, going as far to be known to dismember children when they insult his weight), but most of the time Cartman seems to have a on and off relationship with everyone in in town. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and possibly [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and Kenny, however, seem to be the only ones aware of how dangerous and mentally imbalanced he is, as well as the only ones who try to keep others from falling into his manipulation. Eric has also been portrayed as somewhat of a bully; he always insults new kids with offensive, often profane words, usually never leaving them alone. He physically abuses others, both through his fists and weapons (such as when he hit [[Token Black]] and [[Pip Pirrip]] with rocks). He is also shown to be very vulgar and disgusting, doing things like holding people down and farting on them and making them smell his rectum. He also tells extremely dirty jokes. While many of his male peers think this is funny (especially [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]), it often causes the girls to despise him. Cartman is heavily implied to only pick on others because of the insecurity he has acquired from others calling him fat. Also, despite their hatred of him, all the kids seem to accept him as a leader because of his ability to manipulate people, and sometimes invite him to social events such as parties and vice versa. In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]" particularly, it is implied that Stan, Kyle, and Kenny only hang around with Cartman because they cannot find other friends or vice versa; [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] states that everyone at school hates them, of which [[The Boys|the boys]] immediately dismiss.

The students at South Park Elementary are all apparently aware of Cartman's stuffed animals and his mental health as shown in "[[1%]]", where Craig tells Cartman he should go home and cry to his stuffed animals. However, in the same episode, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny express concern over Cartman's safety and keep a lookout at Token's house to protect him.

==Trivia==
*Cartman has Kenny's eyes, due to the events in the subplot of "[[The Succubus]]".
*Kyle has one of Cartman's kidneys due to the events of "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]".
*It is most likely that Cartman is the youngest of the four friends. His birthday was in the [[Season One|first season]], and it has been clear that he turned 8, while the other boys already were 8 years old. However, Stan made it clear that Cartman and all the other boys were ten years old in "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]" while Stan was still nine years old only to turn ten two episodes later. It could be that the birth dates of all the boys were called out randomly and their permanent birthdays set in later. This mix up made Stan the youngest of the four boys.
*Cartman is mostly known by his family name, and most characters, including Stan, Kyle, Wendy, and Token, call him by his surname.
*In "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", it is shown that Stan and Kyle pick on Cartman because he is fat, not because of his many crimes.
*Cartman has been shown to go to great lengths to get revenge on people who did relatively minor things. An example is in "[[Tsst]]", where Cartman made a kid saw off his own leg and get him sent to the hospital just because the kid called him chubby. Despite this, he never does something like this on any of his friends, despite the fact that they have called him much worse names than "chubby". He also has never arranged a gambit to get Wendy's parents killed like he did Scott Tenorman's, despite the fact that what Wendy did to Cartman was worse than what Scott did. Why he has not done these things yet is not yet known, although it is shown that Wendy can occasionally outsmart Cartman and turn his schemes against him. Cartman may not have sought extreme revenge on Wendy due to his feelings for her; it is shown that he likes Wendy in "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]". Cartman sends a fake police report to a psychiatrist's wife, who then commits suicide; It can be assumed that he knew she would do so, as he is a master of manipulation.
*Cartman maintains somewhat friendly relationships with most of the boys at his school and is shown playing with them on occasion, despite the fact that all the kids openly hate him, though this is considered a love/hate relationship that he shares with the boys.
*In the episode "[[Chickenpox]]", the boys sleep at Kenny's house. When they rolled out their sleeping bags, Kyle and Stan both had ''Terrance and Phillip'' and Cartman had Urkel from ''Family Matters'' on his.
*According to the girls, Cartman is the ugliest boy in their class, likely because of his weight. He is the only one not invited to the girls' party in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]".
*In the "[[The Unaired Pilot]]", Cartman was originally scripted to have a father and a sister. However, they had no speaking lines and were cut for the official pilot onward.
*In the episode "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]" he (along with [[Dog Poo]]) was raped by "the [[Snooki]]", an evil creature from [[Hell]].
*In the episodes "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]" and "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", Cartman is shown to cry when physically attacked.
*He is the only one of the [[:Category:4th graders|fourth graders]] to have noticed Kenny's reoccurring deaths, as shown in "[[Cartmanland]]".
*Cartman saved Kyle for the sole reason to pick on him and have something to do in "[[Smug Alert!]]", despite his apparent desire to kill or get rid of Kyle.
*Cartmans ass is shown to be very powerful in two ways:
#Cartman successfully fights off Craig using his ass in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".
#Cartman successfully imbues the tastes of several different restaurant chains foods into his own burgers by farting on them.
*Cartmans farts are shown to be highly toxic and even deadly in "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]" when an American man in [[Afghanistan]] smells the inside of the cargo area Cartman farted in, and he throws up and appears to have died. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny's surviving could be due to their constant exposure of his farts, and have thus gained a tolerance / resistance to its fatal effects.
*Cartmans farts are apparently harmless if they imbued with food and ingested, as no one gets sick from eating them in "[[Ass Burgers]]", at least until the people who ate them realize what they were eating.
*Cartman is shown to undergo several things that would most likely help him psychologically; he sees a therapist in "[[T.M.I.]]", which screws him, as in the end his penis is still below average; he goes to Fat Camp in "[[Fat Camp]]", and resolves to lose his weight, but is then kicked out, and he is left crying and eating a donut; Cartman makes an altruistic shift in personality in "[[Tsst]]", when Caesar Milan successfully rids Cartman of his dark side, only for it to return to him when his mother, despite knowing what she did to him before, makes him turn back to his normal self.
*"[[1%]]" marks the first time he possibly makes an advance in psychological health, as he kills all of his stuffed animals, who he gave voices and personalities, to the point that one even insulted him in an earlier episode, severing a dangerous psychological attachment to his stuffed toys, even if it was through a delusional episode.
*Cartman's stuffed animal Clyde Frog was decapitated by Kyle in a fit of rage after he was infected with AIDS by Cartman in "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", but was not given a funeral, and in fact survived, and was repaired, presumably by his mother.
*If Cartman has split personalities, then he has, or rather had, at least five; [[Clyde Frog]], [[Peter Panda]], [[Muscleman Marc]], Wumpletumpkins, and [[Polly Prissypants]]. If Mitch Connor / Jennifer Lopez is included, then he would still have one left.
*As shown in the 1992 short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'', the design of Cartman was originally going to be used for Kenny. As shown, when Frosty kills 'Cartman', Kyle yells "Oh my god! They killed Kenny!"
*According to "[[1%]]", Cartman has the cholesterol levels of a 70-year-old man. Cartman's bigotry and greed has actually saved people. In "[[ManBearPig]]", his intent to sneak all of the "treasure" he found actually gave Stan, Kyle, and Kenny a head start before [[Al Gore]] flooded The Cavern of The Winds, which had probably saved them from drowning. In "[[The Snuke]]", Cartman's bigotry against the Muslim student [[Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem|Baahir]] led to the discovery of the snuke in [[Hillary Clinton]]'s vagina, as well as the British Plan to invade America and unend The American Revolution, which prevented a nuclear device from going off in South Park, saving thousands of lives, most likely more, and even possibly saving America from being taken over by The British.
**In "[[The Poor Kid]]", Cartman's greedy nature also led to Child Services being alerted to Kenny's Foster Families abusive nature, as he tried to go to [[Hawaii]] by using Child Services and getting his mother arrested. This led to him ratting out his foster parents, the same ones as Kenny's, and helping the foster children get sent back to their homes. However,[[Mysterion]]'s interference would have probably led to the same thing, as he did get them drunk off of a can [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] Beer.
*Cartman gave only Clyde Frog a funeral in "[[1%]]", but neglected to give one to Peter Panda and his other stuffed toys after they died. This could be due to Cartman's favoritism of Clyde Frog, or due to his panicking from Peter Panda's death and trying to protect his other stuffed animals, only for them die one by one throughout the night.
*Cartman's fear of being branded as "The Poor Kid" is actually very legitimate, as in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]", after he is arrested for hitting Token Black with a rock, Clyde Donovan is then branded as "The Fat Kid", and is thus treated just as Cartman was, being called several names.
**Also, in "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", Token Black is ridiculed for being "The Rich Kid", and thus not be like the other kids, who cannot afford everything he has. Token then invites several black families to South Park, and is left out again. When Token goes back to the others, they tell him how they make fun of his being his rich because they make fun of everyone for being something else; Cartman being fat, as well as many other things, Stan being in love with Wendy, Kyle for being a Jew, Kenny for being poor, and Butters for being a wuss. This shows that the children go out of their way to find something that can insult and rip off each other for, and will transfer that insult to the next person if the present one is not around.
