The '''DOI Agents''' are representatives of the United States Department of Interior who appear in [[Season Three]] episode "[[Jakovasaurs]]".

==Background==
Upon discovery of a female [[Jakovasaur]], it was taken to the [[City Hall]] and presented to three Department of Interior agents. The agents claimed that a live Jakovasaur had never been seen, and requested that it gets a chance at repopulation, granting a Jakovasaur couple to a [[Jakov Residence|new home]] where it can produce offspring.

Upon realizing that the Jakovasaur population had grown out of control, the agents decided to flee [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], but not before appointing [[Eric Cartman]] an official member of the DOI, granting him authority over all wildlife in South Park.

==Appearance==
Each of the agents wear working suits of different colors, and a pair of black square-framed glasses.
