'''Michael Theodore "Mickey" Mouse''' is the icon and mascot of The Walt Disney Company, the CEO of Disney, and one of the most recognized animated characters in the world. He played his first major role in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[The Ring]]".

==Background==
He made his first cameo in a sketch with him having a large erection from [[Mitch Murphy]] in "[[Eek, A Penis!]]". He later physically appeared in the uncut DVD movie version of "[[Imaginationland]]", being attacked and killed by the evil imaginary characters. During "[[The Ring]]", his main motive with the Jonas Brothers was to "sell sex" to young, innocent girls with sex euphemisms to "stupid" Christian families.

At the end of the episode, Mickey is shown giving himself magically to have the ability to grow in size, breathe fire, and fly. He is seen hovering over the city in anger while he mimics the Mickey Mouse balloon seen in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It is implied that Mickey might be of some sort of divine origin. A news reporter on the scene, commenting on Mickey's onslaught mentions that Mickey would afterward return to Valhalla, of Norse mythology, where he would then slumber and feed.

Mickey has once seen again in the "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" duologue series with the celebrities who were suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]; he had a speaking part in "[[201]]" where he is one of the many celebrities and gingers arguing who gets to go into the goo machine and later on fights against the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]].

Mickey reappears in "[[Obama Wins!]]" and is still in control of the Disney Corporation. Thrilled at the redemption of the ''[[List of Star Wars References|Star Wars]]'' franchise, he schemes with [[Eric Cartman]] to get [[Mitt Romney]] elected President of the [[United States]] by making him have a cameo in future ''Star Wars'' movies.

Mickey reappears in "[[Band in China]]" where he scolds major Marvel, Star Wars, and other Disney characters he owns for pissing off the Chinese government as it's their biggest market for income, he even disowns [[Winnie the Pooh]] because the Chinese consider him offensive. He later teams up with [[Randy Marsh]] and fails to convince the Chinese to allow Randy to sell [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] weed in China, even developing a liking towards it. He then states that they need to show the Chinese that they should understand what it means to be made fun of and, presumably, orders Randy to kill Winnie the Pooh, causing the Chinese to allow Randy to sell his weed in China.

Mickey appears in "[[The Pandemic Special]]" where there were more revealed details of what happened with him and Randy in China back in "Band in China" (which includes having sex with a [[bat]] and a [[pangolin]]). During the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, Mickey has problems with stabilizing Disney without failing and getting bankrupt while getting angry at Randy for doing the sexual activity. He sends a live human heart to Randy as a deadly threat after Randy admits that he may have caused the COVID-19 crisis. He plans to have him killed and take his DNA to the vaccines while calling him in a deserted [[Disneyland]] about the threat.

==Appearance==
Mickey is a black mouse with a tan area near his eyes as well as his snout area. He wears his signature outfit with a white "dress" shirt and red tie, pink, gold-buttoned shorts, white gloves, and large, brown shoes.

==Personality==
Although he is portrayed as a good character in "[[Imaginationland]]", he is considered cruel and cold-hearted in "[[The Ring]]". In this episode, Mickey is given a more prominent role, where he is seen as the owner of the Disney Company and boss to the [[Jonas Brothers]]. Mickey is portrayed as an evil money-hungry, a foul-mouthed corporate mogul who is both verbally and physically abusive to his employees; even other Disney characters (including those from Marvel Studios and Star Wars) all fear him in general. For example, when Joe Jonas states that he would quit doing his work about the [[Purity Ring|purity rings]], Mickey punches Joe in the balls and begins kicking his face as he fell, then forcing him to get up and agree to his statement. In the same episode, Mickey appears to be insanely threatening with wanting to kill [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and Jonas Brothers with a chainsaw to prevent them from ruining his concert. Another example is when Thor states that the Chinese government is exploiting their people through labor, Mickey angrily orders Thor to shut up. It should be noted that Mickey says his trademark ''"Ha-ha!"'' chuckle at the end of most of his sentences, which in context, it comes off like a nervous tic since he does this even when he is enraged.
