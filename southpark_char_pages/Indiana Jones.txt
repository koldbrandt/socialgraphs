'''Indiana Jones''' is the protagonist of the films ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and its sequels. The films were written by [[George Lucas]] and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

Indiana Jones appears in the episode, "[[The China Probrem]]", where he is shown being repeatedly raped by Lucas and Spielberg (a result of ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''). This is referenced again in "[[Pandemic]]" when Kyle says he could not go to Peru since "a friend was raped there". A picture of him is seen in [[Bradley Biggle]]'s room in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]".

==Appearance==
Indiana Jones appeared briefly in "[[Free Hat]]". During the premiere of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', he was shown swinging across a chasm, and in another shot retrieving the headpiece treasure.

In "[[The China Probrem]]", he is shown in a brown "cowboy" hat, a nearly half-unbuttoned tan shirt, brown coat, and brownish pants. He also appears to be wearing a sack of some sort as well as a belt. In the episode "[[200]]", he is shown being held against his will in BDSM bondage gear, a ball gag, and a leash, which is held by [[George Lucas]].
