The '''Moorish Fighters''' are an enemy faction in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
In Ancient Zaron, the Moors attempt to take the [[Stick of Truth]] from the humans and elves. After a few men were brought down by [[The New Kid|King Douchebag]], the Moors summoned a [[Moorish Dragon|dragon]], but that was too defeated with the King's ultimate ability. As the King approaches the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]], a small group of fighters, led by [[Kevin Stoley]], were interrogating [[The Bard (Character)|The Bard]] on the whereabouts of the Stick of Truth. This was interrupted by [[Eric Cartman]], who decided to play superheroes instead (appearing as [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]), and instructs the Fighters of Zaron to follow suit. The Moorish fighters who do not have a superhero persona, to begin with, were left out, but not before being called "dorks".

==Appearance==
All Moorish fighters are distinguished by their bicycle helmets, some with spikes attached. A standard warrior holds a small sword and a wooden shield. A bruiser dons a mask with a sharp teeth design and wields a battle-ax that is crafted from a road sign.
