}}
'''Georgie "Firkle" Smith''' is a kindergartener who first appeared in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Raisins]]". He is the youngest member of the [[Goth Kids]].

==Background==
Firkle says that most people are "Nazi conformist cheerleaders", and that he is the biggest non-conformist there is. In "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", Firkle turns on the other goth kids and reveals that he was in on the plot to turn people "emo" with plants. Later, it is discovered that the plants were fake. He was shocked that he betrayed his friends for nothing. He was likely readmitted back into the group; he is still seen with the other Goth Kids in subsequent appearances.

===Criminal Record===
*'''Arson:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", he set fire to the South Park Hot Topic store, burning it to bits and pieces.
*'''Attempted murder:''' Firkle attempts to kill Mysterion in "[[Mysterion Rises]]", but the Cult Leader does so instead.
*'''Attempted murder/kidnapping:''' In "The Ungroundable", he, along with the Goths, kidnaps [[Mike Makowski]], the leader of the South Park Vampire Society, with the intent of murdering him. However, they change their minds after he admits he is not a vampire and ship him off to Scottsdale, Arizona instead.
*'''Drug abuse/underage smoking: '''The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their ages (5-11), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Treason/sedition:''' In the Superhero Arc, the Goths are shown to be part of the Cthulhu cult and supporting the [[Cthulhu|eponymous monster's]] reign of terror. They later leave the cult, though, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome.
*'''Violation of firearm laws/threatening with a deadly weapon''': In [[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]], Firkle threatens Michael, Mike, and Pete with a gun. Because he is no older than six, it is illegal for him to have this weapon.

===Talents===
====Music====
He plays the drums in the Goth Kids' band during the talent show in "[[Erection Day]]".
===Weaponry===
Whenever things do not go his way, he pulls up a weapon at his enemies to fear him. In "[[Mysterion Rises]]", he opens up a blade in front of the [[Mysterion]]. And in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", he pulls up a cocked gun and points it at the Goth Kids and the [[South Park Vampire Society|Vamp Kids]]. It is never shown with Firkle killing anyone on-screen, but he uses his blade for battles in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''.

==Appearance==
[[File:Kid_goth.png|thumb]]
He is referred to as a midget in "[[The Ungroundable]]" by an unknown student when wearing regular clothes. He has short, soft black hair with a long side-swept fringe parted to the right, wears dark purple lipstick and black eyeliner. He wears a black trench coat, black pants, and black shoes.

As a conformist in "[[The Ungroundable]]", he wore a turquoise dress-shirt, khaki pants, and gray shoes with a white stripe each.

During the [[Attack the School]] quest in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', he dresses up as a Viking. He wears a brown Viking helmet (more different than [[Michael|Michael's]] and appears heavy), and a green-silked cape.

When he reveals himself as an actual Emo in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", the hair he had on was just a toupee. He had his actual hair dyed magenta at the ends with a smaller fringe, a dark-gray t-shirt with a gray skull and polka-dots, and some colorful bracelets.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Firkle appears as an adult man, and is radically different from his past form. Firkle seemingly was stopped adding make up to make his skin pale, because it its now the most natural shade of the Goth Kids. In addition he still has a similar hair but with an under buzzcut. He also has tear-like eye shadow, a brow piercing, sunken cheeks, and seemingly has tattoos on his arms.

==Personality==
Like the other goth kids, Firkle is depressed, cynical, nihilistic, wallows in his own self-pity, and is akin to the goth stereotype. In "[[Mysterion Rises]]", Firkle pulls out a switchblade and threatens to murder [[Mysterion]], proving he is fully capable of taking a person's life for the [[Cult of Cthulhu]]. In "Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers", Firkle betrays the other goth kids. His willingness to sacrifice his friends, with no hesitation, and simply for his own benefit, makes him the least "conformist" of all of the Goth Kids.
