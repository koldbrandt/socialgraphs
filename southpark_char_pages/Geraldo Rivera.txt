'''Geraldo Rivera''' was a former talk show host and later news journalist for Fox News. He made his first appearance in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]" and later appears in "[[A Million Little Fibers]]".

==Background==
During his first appearance in "[[Weight Gain 4000]]," Geraldo hosts a talk show ''Geraldo'', [[Eric Cartman]] becomes a guest on his talk show focusing on obesity, after he ate an excessive amount of weight gain powder, resulting in him becoming so fat, that he is unable to leave his home. Geraldo talks to [[Larry King]] live from Afghanistan as a war news correspondent on ''Larry King Live''. He exposes Stephen McTowelie, author of the book ''[[A Million Little Fibers (Book)|A Million Little Fibers]]'', as not being a person, but simply the towel.

==Personality==
He moves and speaks like a gay stereotype, with fluttery movements and flying wrists and an obvious lisp that gay stereotypes have. He is determined to find the answer on any case and does ridiculous poses on camera.

==Appearance==
In his first appearance he wore a light blue shirt, a red bow tie, gray suspenders, and black pants. He had black hair with open bangs and black mustache. His appearance has changed a lot in "[[A Million Little Fibers]]" where he wears a pink shirt under a dark blue suit, dark blue pants, and black shoes. He also had some wrinkles on his face and thick eyebrows and his hair now has a hairstyle.
