'''Paul David Hewson''', better known professionally as '''Bono''', is the lead singer of the Irish rock band [[U2]] and a famous activist for assorted causes. He appears in the episode "[[More Crap]]", where he serves as the main antagonist. After [[Mr. Hankey]] and his family, Bono is the second form of fecal matter capable of talking in ''[[South Park]]''. However, he is the first to take on a human form. 

==Background==
When [[Randy Marsh]] took the "world's biggest crap", the [[European Fecal Standards and Measurements Board]] revealed that Bono was the previous holder of the record. Furious at someone beating him and making him "number 2", he proceeds to take a massive crap of his own, beating out Randy.

When [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] begins investigating Bono's odd behavior, it is revealed that Bono did not take the world's biggest crap, but actually is the world's biggest crap, once taken by a ranking member of the EFSMB. He was transformed from crap into a human being when the board member fed him breast milk from his own chest. This explained why he could do so much good and accomplish so many great things, and still appear to be a piece of crap.

Bono also appears during the [[Britney's New Look|MTV Awards]] to watch [[Britney Spears|Britney's]] performance.

Bono later makes an appearance in "[[200]]", saying that the people of South Park had insulted him by claiming he was made of shit, implicitly denying that this revelation was true. He also appeared in the following episode, "[[201]]," but doesn't have any lines. 

Bono also makes a cameo in "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]" with the rest of the band, U2. They were said to have performed, but they only appeared in the announcement.

==Appearance==
Bono wears black pants, a black dress shirt, and a black coat with red accents. He has combed black hair, a 5 o'clock shadow, and wears red-tinted glasses. He can also be seen wearing a wicker hat and earrings.
