==Personality==
On ''Family Guy'', Peter is a stereotypical blue-collar worker who frequently gets drunk with his neighbors and friends, Cleveland Brown, Joe Swanson, and Glenn Quagmire at "The Drunken Clam," Quahog's local tavern. On ''South Park'', he is portrayed similarly, but may be somewhat more of a slacker who gets involved in foolish and nonsensical acts, mainly parodying Family Guy's infamous cutaway gags.

==Prominence==
*"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" - Appears on the ''Family Guy'' show.
*"[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"
*"[[Canada on Strike]]" - Briefly shows up on the ''Family Guy'' show representing American comedy.

==Trivia==
*Unlike his appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'', Peter has black pants in ''[[South Park]]'' while in ''Family Guy'' his pants are green, nor does he have a tie in ''Family Guy''.
