'''Principal Victoria''' is the former principal of [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Pinkeye]]", and was usually seen with school counselor [[Mr. Mackey]] and shop class teacher [[Richard Adler]]. Sometime prior to the events of [[Season Nineteen]], she was let go from South Park Elementary and replaced by [[PC Principal]]. She is currently voiced by [[April Stewart]] and was previously voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] and [[Eliza Schneider]].

==Background==
Victoria was quite capable of running the school, despite the stupidity and ineptitude of the rest of the school faculty. In "[[Go God Go]]", she informs [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] that she knows too little about evolution to teach it and replaces her with [[Richard Dawkins]]. In early appearances, she has a heavy accent that sounds rather similar to being from Wisconsin or [[Sarah Palin]], though it seems to have diminished over the years and with the changing of voice actors.

In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", she is revealed to be a strong feminine rights activist as she tells [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] that she is a 7-year breast cancer survivor and encourages Wendy to fight for what she believes in no matter what the consequences could be for her. She shows contempt for [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and compares him directly to cancer, referring to him metaphorically as "pure evil", and "a fat little lump that needs to be destroyed". As she was the one who convinced Wendy to fight Cartman regardless of the rules, it's unlikely that she punished Wendy for fighting Cartman.

It is hinted in "[[Toilet Paper]]" by [[Josh Myers|Josh]] that she had an abusive mother who "spanked her thighs with cold cuts and stuck umbrellas up her ass". This has not been confirmed, but because he was able to correctly predict [[Officer Barbrady]]'s own abuse, this is plausible.

Despite her intelligence, she has been shown at times to be quite oblivious to things, such as in "[[Pinkeye]]", where she makes Cartman a "ghost" costume that bore a striking resemblance to a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood.

In "[[Stunning and Brave]]", it was announced that she was fired from [[South Park Elementary]] due to an incident where a student referred to rape as a "Hot Cosby" and got replaced with [[PC Principal]]. In "[[Sponsored Content]]", she reveals she was replaced and the "Hot Cosby" was made up to get her fired. In "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", it is revealed that she got fired because of [[Mr. Mackey]].

===Criminal Record===
*'''Murder''': In "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]", she confessed to having killed a man, despite the fact that the trial in which she made this proclamation had nothing to do with whatever she might be guilty of. However, she explained: "I hit him over the head and cut up the body. I tried to burn it, but it wouldn't burn! I put the legs in the garbage bags and put the torso under the bridge. I had to do it!!", whereupon she then burst into tears.
*'''Attempted Murder''': She and [[Mr. Mackey]], along with [[Richard Adler|Mr. Adler]], attempted to murder [[Eric Cartman]] to cover up their crime of poisoning the students with tainted pizza in "[[Bass to Mouth]]".
*'''Kidnapping''': She, [[Caitlyn Jenner]], and [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] kidnap [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and interrogate him about what has happened to the town since they left ([[Shi Tpa Town]], [[Whole Foods Market]]).

==Personality==
Victoria, unlike the other residents of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], is very intelligent, competent, and rational. In fact, she is one of the few people in the entire show to be recognized as such. She is often objective to immoral or witless ideas that she is certain will end in catastrophe, and will only resort to these actions if she feels there is no other choice. She is also shown to be very motivational, such as in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]".

Despite this, Victoria has, on occasion, shown to have a dark side and be somewhat satirical to many of the characters she encounters. She was seen to have been involved in some assaults and committed second-degree murder.

==Appearance==
Victoria wears a pink shirt and black trousers. She has large eyeglasses and curly hair in a perm style. In addition, she speaks with a thick Minnesotan accent, although as of the later seasons it has diminished.

For special occasions, as seen in the awards ceremony scene in "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", Victoria wears an unusual outfit consisting of a lavender V-neck blouse with white lace trim around the collar, a long flared black skirt which reaches her shoes, and a pastel pink cummerbund.

In "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]", Victoria is said to have a "nice ass" and it is referenced many times by the male characters, even [[Herbert Garrison]].

==Quotes==
*'''Principal Victoria''': "I see. I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?"<br />'''Wendy''': "Ma'am?"<br />'''Principal Victoria''': "I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed. When there is cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you."<br />'''Wendy''': "My... parents said that if I fight-"<br />'''Principal Victoria''': "And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you. You have to be willing to give up everything because cancer will take everything. Do you understand?"<br />'''Wendy''': "Yes, ma'am!"<br />'''Principal Victoria''': "When you have cancer, you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!" from "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"

==Trivia==
*Her name is a pun of actress [[wikipedia:Victoria Principal|Victoria Principal]].
*As revealed in "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", it seems that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has defecated in her purse seven times.
*In "[[Sponsored Content]]", Principal Victoria is seen with a cane. This implies that she received some sort of damage to her knee. Given her replacement by [[PC Principal]] and his well-known fondness for breaking the legs of people he dislikes, it is possible that she was assaulted by him.
*So far, she is one of the few major [[South Park Elementary|South Park Elementary School]] faculty characters, both former and current, to have never joined a cult.
*She pronounces Eric Cartman's first name as "Ee-rick" instead of "Eh-rick".
*She is considered to be attractive by most of the male population of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and this is a recurring topic of conversation by them in some episodes. In one, she is even seen naked in bed with [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]].
*It was revealed in [[Sexual Harassment Panda]] that she has murdered somebody, claiming that she "had to do it".
