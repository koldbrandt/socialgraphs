'''Michelle Obama''' is the former First Lady of the United States of America. She appears in the episode, "[[About Last Night...]]", as [[Barack Obama]]'s wife and conspirator.

==Background==
Michelle and her daughters were revealed to not be truly family to Obama, but rather a cover that was designed to give him a proper 'family' look while running for president. Although she is a loving mother, Michelle is a computer hacking genius hired to help Obama and [[John McCain]] steal the hope diamond.

After succeeding in the heist and faking their deaths, Obama decided to give being president a chance and asks Michelle to be a real family, and be his first lady. Michelle agrees by kissing him passionately after saying ''"Oh...what the fuck?"'' Michelle reappears in a non-speaking role in "[[Sexual Healing]]".

==Appearance==
Michelle has long, black hair as well as a very prominent nose. She wears a red dress, a small, gold necklace, (presumably) diamond earrings, black mascara, red lipstick, and dark red high heels.

==Personality==
She seems to be moral-less, even having no problems with tricking the entirety of the United States in order to procure the Hope Diamond. However, she does seem to care for her daughters, showcased by her initial refusal to start an actual relationship with Obama due to her girls deserving something more than a "world-class diamond thief".

==Prominence==
