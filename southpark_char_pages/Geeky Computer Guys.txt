The '''Geeky Computer Guys''' (also called the '''Star Trek Nerds''') are two male college students who sometimes help out [[the boys]] in times of trouble. They have shown to be useful and talented in both science as well as special effects, but also to get into squabbles with each other over trivial things, such as the number of episodes in ''Star Trek: The Original Series''.

==Background==
They made their first appearance in "[[Fourth Grade]]", where they build two time machines for the boys, in order to return to the third grade. 

They reappeared briefly in "[[Freak Strike]]", where they helped the boys attach a set of prosthetic testes to Butters' chin so he can go on the [[Maury Povich]] show, in exchange for an edited copy of ''Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace''.

They were also seen worshipping with the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] in "[[Mysterion Rises]]".

In "[[Cock Magic]]", they appeared in the background watching the [[Magic: The Gathering (CCG)]] game at the Hobby store.

==Appearance==
Both of the nerds wear sandals and round-framed glasses. The first nerd wears light blue shorts, a navy blue shirt with the words "Resistance is futile!" written in green, and a green coat. He has long blond hair in the style of a ponytail.

The other nerd wears green pants, a black shirt with the words "Yeah, resistance is futile!" written in red, and a black wrist brace. He has short brown hair, which is receding, and has a brown mustache and beard.

==Prominence==
*"[[Fourth Grade]]" - They help the boys build two time machines.
*"[[Freak Strike]]" - They build Butters prosthetic testes to attach to his chin.
*"[[Red Sleigh Down]]" - They are seen in the crowd during the Christmas celebrations.
*"[[Good Times with Weapons]]" - They are looking at knives at the fair.
*"[[Mysterion Rises]]" - They are seen at the Cthulhu cult meeting.
*"[[Cock Magic]]" - They can be seen watching the ''[[Magic: The Gathering (CCG)|Magic: The Gathering]]'' match in the comic book store.

==Trivia==
*According to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], they are college students who live next door to him.
*In the DVD commentary for "[[Fourth Grade]]", [[Matt Stone]] confirms that they are based on the two "systems guys", Sean Laverty and [[J. J. Franzen]]. The blonde is based on Sean, and the brunette on JJ, whose website avatar looks similar.
*In their first appearance, "[[Fourth Grade]]" they make a number of ''Star Trek'' references. Beyond their debut episode, ''Resistance is Futile'', written on both of their shirts, is a phrase used by the [[w:c:memory-alpha:borg|Borg]] from ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and later series, usually when threatening assimilation into the collective.
