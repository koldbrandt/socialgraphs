'''Mr. Gueermo''' is [[Bridon Gueermo]]'s dancing-theater crazed, abusive, and flamboyant metrosexual father who loves to sing and dance. He first appears as the main antagonist in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[Elementary School Musical]]". 

He is part of the men's choir club and usually talks to his family in a sing-song voice. Even in normal conversations, he forces his family to sing with him, otherwise he slaps them.

==Background==
Every move he makes is overly swishy, his hips constantly swaying and his hands are limp at the wrist, and flamboyant. He always speaks with a stereotypical gay lisp no doubt due to his noticeable overbite. He often spends a great deal of time looking at himself in full-length mirrors, either out of a vanity or to examine his dance moves in order to perfect them. He also slaps people when he gets angry and his slaps are also portrayed as being rather flamboyant and loudly threatening. As he is slapping someone he yells, "I'll slap you!". Apparently, he slaps people on a daily basis, when Bridon was about to run away from home, he held up his hand and told him; ''"Go Ahead. Make my day."''

The obvious victims are, of course, his son and his wife, but also members of Child Protective Services, several members of the school staff, such as the basketball coach and [[Mr. Mackey]], and even his own neighbor. Despite the fact that people get mildly hurt when he slaps them, he turns out to be extremely weak and cowardly, as seen when Bridon punches his father straight in the nose out of frustration. Horrified, and confused, at the greater show of physical violence, Mr. Gueermo cowers away, only to be beaten more by his frustrated [[Mrs. Gueermo|wife]].

Despite the fight, Mr. and Mrs. Gueermo remain together, and Mrs. Gueermo makes her husband come with her to attend their son's first basketball game. He is still bitter about Bridon joining basketball but ended up enjoying the cheering aspects of the game, such as singing and stomping when singing "[[We Will Rock You]]".

He also appears briefly in "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]" with other various male characters of South Park as they sing an amendment song to the women of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] allowing them to queef, "[[Queef Free]]".

==Appearance==
Mr. Gueermo wears dark gray pants, black shoes, and a pink collared shirt. He has effeminate wavy brown hair and wears a black necklace with a large orange bead on it. At home, he wears a white tank top and gray underwear.

==Personality==
Mr. Gueermo is an abusive father and husband, who is utterly obsessed with musical theater. He has apparently spent his son's entire life grooming him to be a Broadway performer. He thinks basketball is a "sissy" sport, and refuses to let his son play it, even though most of Bridon's peers think he should let him do it. His stage-parenting is so terrible, that he will 'attack' anyone who questions his actions or methods in any way.

Most of the comedy of Mr. Gueermo comes from his very effeminate personality contrasting with his aggressiveness, and his low opinion of sport compared to music theater is completely opposite to a stereotypical father. A stereotypical father would prefer their son to be engaged in sports, rather than musical theater which would be considered overly feminine.

==Prominence==
*"[[Elementary School Musical]]" - Goes crazy with slapping people when they oppose him and forces Bridon to become a singer until his family gets enough of his abuse.
*"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]" - Sings "[[Queef Free]]" with the other men in the town. Neither [[Mrs. Gueermo|his wife]] nor [[Bridon Gueermo|his son]] appear here.
*"[[201]]" - Seen seeking shelter from [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]] with his family.
*"[[Stunning and Brave]]" - 
*"[[The City Part of Town]]" - Seen at the [[Whole Foods Market]].
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.

===Movies===
*''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'' - Appears in the [[Shady Acres]] retirement home.

==Trivia==
*His name sounds like "Queer Mo", meaning one who acts exaggeratedly gay, because of his flamboyant personality
*Mr. Gueermo's personality is exactly the opposite as opposed to Troy Bolton's father in High School Musical. Unlike Troy's father who wanted his son to play sport, Mr. Gueermo wants his son to engage in Theatre and singing.
