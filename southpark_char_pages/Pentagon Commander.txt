:''For the commander seen in the Imaginational trilogy, see [[General Deckter]].''
The '''Pentagon Commander''' appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode "[[AWESOM-O]]".

==Background==
Upon knowing the existence of a robot named [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]] (an alter-ego of [[Eric Cartman]]), the Pentagon commander plans to use it as a weapon against potential enemies. After retrieving the robot, the commander instructs a scientist to "power it on", only for Cartman to respond as himself. The commander however, immediately thinks that A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000 is a super-robot that was given memories and an identity, ordering the scientist to "erase" all memories and consciousness from the robot.

When the scientist is caught trying to free the robot, the commander gives the order to kill the scientist. Just then, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who has been looking for his robot the whole time, rushes up to A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000, pleading the commander not to kill the robot. The commander is touched by Butters' showing of affection and agrees that there is consciousness in the robot, before realizing the true identity when Cartman farted during his speech.

Following this, Butters plays Cartman's video to the whole town, where he dresses up as [[Britney Spears]] and dances with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cutout. The commander watches the video with laughter, turning to Cartman and calling him "a little faggot".

==Appearance==
The Pentagon Commander sports a gray flat top hair. He wears a dark green military jacket over a white uniform, dark green pants, and black shoes.
