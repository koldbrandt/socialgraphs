==Background==
Joe and Teresa Giudice move to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], Colorado where they become [[Stan Marsh]]'s new neighbors. The Marshes invite the new family to dinner, where Teresa displays her bad temper and attitude, gossiping about the people in South Park and insulting [[Sharon Marsh]]. Every time Teresa becomes angry, her husband Joe tries to calm her down.

Later, while at the beauty salon with her friends Jacqueline, Danielle, and Caroline, Teresa becomes offended when asked to wait ten minutes for another client by the hairdresser. She acts belligerent and nasty towards the customers and staff until [[Sheila Broflovski]], who was once also from New Jersey, slaps Teresa and calls her a "psycho-bitch" and a "trashy whore". This causes Teresa back down and leave the Salon in shock and horror, along with the other housewives.

Teresa has a dark complexion and wears heavy make-up. She is seen wearing a black and purple dress and gold bracelets. She has black hair with brown highlights.

Joe wears black pants, a black shirt, and gold chains. He has short black hair and is shown to be physically strong.
