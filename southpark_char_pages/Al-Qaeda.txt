'''Al-Qaeda''' is the name of a terrorist organization known for being militant and religious extremists. The group appeared in "[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]" and "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]". They save [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from [[United States#New Jersey|New Jersey]].

==Background==
New Jersey is invading every town in the US and will likely spread throughout the world if not stopped. [[Randy Marsh]] and [[Jimbo Kern]] send a video tape to Al-Qaeda showing the debauched way of life of these Jersey-ites, hoping they would come to help with the war in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The Al Qaeda army arrives at the end when it seemed New Jersey would win and using commercial airline jets, they crash it towards the crowd, saving the town and free the people restoring peace once more.

==Appearance==
Al-Qaeda members typically wear the clothing style of the Arab, which consists of robes, turbans, and beards.

==Trivia==
*Their founder and leader was [[Osama bin Laden]], who was killed on ''[[South Park]]'' by the American government at the end of "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]" and, seven months later, in real life.
*Their method of attacking the Jersey-ites is a direct reference to the [[wikipedia:September 11 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]].
