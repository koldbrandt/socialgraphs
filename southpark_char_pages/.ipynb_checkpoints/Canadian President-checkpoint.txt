The '''Canadian President''' appeared in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Where My Country Gone?]]". He was a "brash asshole who just spoke his mind", which the [[Canada|Canadians]] found funny at first. However, they let the joke go on for too long and he was mistakenly elected.

==Background==
Following his election, he made Canada such a horrible place to live that the Canadians fled to the [[United States]]. He later built the [[Canadian Wall]] in order to keep the Americans out. However, [[Herbert Garrison]] managed to bypass the wall.

Mr. Garrison met with the Canadian president and they quickly got into a fight which ended with Mr. Garrison fucking the Canadian president to death. Immediately after learning about the death of the Canadian president, the Canadians returned to Canada with joy.

==Appearance==
His appearance was very similar to [[Donald Trump]]. He had blond hair, bushy eyebrows, and bags under his eyes. He wore a blue suit with a white undershirt, and a light blue tie.

==Personality==
The Canadian president was extremely outspoken, insolent and offensive. He constantly told people to "suck his balls", and was shown to have xenophobia towards the United States. He was also highly selfish and egocentric, only caring for his own well-being and being contemptous of everyone else. 

==Trivia==
*He is a parody of Donald Trump, from his looks to his loud, abrasive demeanor. Trump successfully ran for President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential election.
*In reality, Canada is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, consisting of a prime minister as head of government and a monarch as head of state, as opposed to a president.
*The President of Canada enjoys dancing to "[[The Safety Dance]]" by the Canadian new wave band Men Without Hats.
