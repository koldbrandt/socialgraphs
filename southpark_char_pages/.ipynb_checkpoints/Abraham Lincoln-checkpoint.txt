'''Abraham Lincoln''' was the 16th President of the [[United States]] who first appeared in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[The List]]". 
==Appearance==
Abraham Lincoln can be seen wearing a black top hat, a white, button-up undershirt, a black suit, gray pants, and a black bow-tie. He has a gray beard and an overall "wrinkly" appearance. It was believed, but not yet medically proven, that he had Marfan Syndrome, which causes problems with posture, and as such contributed to an awkward personal appearance.

==Personality==
He appears to children in need of motivation, he appeared to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in "[[The List]]", trying to convince him that being ugly is a good thing, and he then tries to motivate Kyle to work, and not burn down the school, hinting at a particular excess of compassion. With these facts, we can assume he is, morally, a good person. While originally maintaining this calm and compassionate demeanor, he was quick to call Kyle a "fucking asshole" when Kyle refused to listen to his advice. With these facts, we can assume Abraham Lincoln is a compassionate person but can have his limits for patience when people refuse to heed his lessons. However, it is also possible that this version of Lincoln is based on Kyle's personal view of him.

==Interactions==
===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
He was shown to care about Kyle's wellbeing in "[[The List]]", trying to convince him that being ugly was a good thing because he wouldn't be handed things, and therefore, would have to work, which would allow Kyle to excel in life. He uses the example of one of Jamal, [[the Ugly Kids]], by taking Kyle to Jamal's residence. Abraham tells Kyle that Jamal is well aware that because he is an ugly kid, no one is going to stack the deck in his favor. Peeping inside the window, Kyle saw Jamal playing the piano, to which Abraham Lincoln pointed out that Jamal practices long and hard at this, which will one day likely pay off. Kyle continued to wallow in self-pity; Abraham got fed up with this (since his job was to teach a lesson and he did his job), called Kyle a "fucking asshole", and then drove off.

==Quotes==
*Abraham Lincoln: "Well then, you're just a fucking asshole!" from "[[The List]]"

==Trivia==
