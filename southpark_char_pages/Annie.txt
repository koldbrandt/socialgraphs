{{LinkDisambig|Annie (Disambiguation)}}
'''Annie''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. She joined [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' "kissing company" in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", and has since become a background character.

==Background==
Annie debuted in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", where she joined Butters' kissing company later than his first worker [[Sally Darson]]. She did not speak but was shown being trained by Butters and referred by name.

She made her first speaking appearance in "[[Hummels & Heroin]]", telling [[Marcus Preston]] about the death of Peppa Pig.

==Appearance==
Annie has short, curly orange hair with a cyan clip with a yellow flower on it. She wears a light pink-rimmed pink shirt with a yellow flower at its center, a cyan jacket, and blue pants. She has a more detailed appearance than most fourth graders.
