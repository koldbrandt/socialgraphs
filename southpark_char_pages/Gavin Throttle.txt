'''Gavin Throttle''' is the coach for the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]], who appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode "[[Stanley's Cup]]".

==Background==
Gavin is relentless, as seen when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] asks him to lose the game purposely so [[Nelson Brown]] will live, to which Gavin doesn't agree to even though a kid's life is at stake and still plans to beat Stan's team. However, despite his confidence, the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] proves to be just as inexperienced and unable to play as the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]], which suggests that Gavin may be an inexperienced coach.

==Appearance==
Gavin has combed brown hair and wears a white collared shirt with a red tie. On top of that he wears a collared black suit. He also wears grey pants and black shoes. Plus, his facial expression is always one of arrogance and confidence.
