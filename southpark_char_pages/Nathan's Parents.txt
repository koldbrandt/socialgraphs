'''[[Nathan]]'s Parents''' appear at the end of the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Handicar]]".

==Background==
Throughout the whole of "[[Handicar]]", Nathan unsuccessfully tries to sabotage [[Handi Car]] just so that he does not have to attend summer camp. He finds it hard to communicate with his parents and so barely confides in them; he gets angry when [[Mimsy]] suggests that he simply tell them not to send him to camp. Having exhausted all other options at the end of the episode, Nathan finally confesses to his mother that he hates summer camp and does not want to go any more. Nathan's mother pretends not to understand what he says. It turns out that she and her husband are bent on sending him to camp just to ensure their trip to [[Italy]].

==Personality==
They are selfish and do not care about their son, forcing him to go to camp against his will just so that they can go to Italy. Nathan's mother pretends to be loving and ignorant of what her son says, but she is in fact covering up for her and her husband.

==Appearance==
Nathan's father has eyebrows and light brown combed hair, a double chin and large ears and wears a dark green short-sleeved shirt, black belt with a gray buckle, white pants and black shoes. The mother has brown hair and eyebrows and wears a white shirt under a blue jacket, black skirt and black shoes.
