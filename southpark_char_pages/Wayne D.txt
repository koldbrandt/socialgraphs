'''Wayne D''' is a character that appeares in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[T.M.I.]]". His personality is the stereotype of a white guy attempting to act like a stereotypical black guy. He also appeared as one of the Mall security guards in the "[[Black Friday]]" Trilogy.

==Appearance==
Wayne D has a black hat, that says "PLAYA" on it, and a white do-rag. He wears a red LeBron James Miami Heat basketball jersey, with the number 6 on it, and under the jersey, he has a grey shirt over another white shirt. He also wears baggy pants that sag, which cause his underpants to show. He has brown hair.
