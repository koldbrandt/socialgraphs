'''Alec Baldwin''' is an American actor, famous for his extensive film work and comedic roles on ''30 Rock'' and ''Saturday Night Live''.

==Background==
He first appears in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', where he and his brothers meet their end when the [[Canada|Canadian Air force]] bombs their mansion in retaliation to the arrest of comedy team [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the United States. This incident begins the [[American-Canadian War]] over censorship issues.

He then appears in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Let Go, Let Gov]]", where he endorses the social media tool, [[Shitter]]and hosts a talk show on the MSNBC network, called ''Free Pass with Alec Baldwin''.

==Appearance==
Alec Baldwin has combed gray hair and wears a navy business suit, which consists of a white shirt, navy pants, black shoes and a blue tie with light blue stripes. He is also missing both of his thumbs, which he cut off after Tweeting something homophobic.

==Personality==
He seems to be sexually obsessed, as he reveals that he had sex with Kim Basinger and possibly Jennifer Love Hewitt and had threesome with his brother and Daryl Hannah and always wants a "pussy sandwich".

==Trivia==
*Baldwin also appears as a character in Trey Parker and Matt Stone's 2004 film ''Team America: World Police'' as a member of the Film Actors' Guild (F.A.G.), and as in ''Bigger, Longer & Uncut'', he is killed - here, he is shot by [[Kim Jong-il]] until his head explodes.

==Prominence==
*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Killed.
*"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]"
