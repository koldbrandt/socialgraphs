'''Orlich''' was a member of the [[The Burger King Bandits|Burger King Bandits]], who robbed a Burger King in "[[Super Fun Time]]". He was the gang's computer expert. He did not trust [[Franz]] with the loot as he presumed he would flee with it and would never see him again and so demanded his cut early, which was only what seemed to be a measly Burger King kid's meal and three dollar bills. When the police stormed [[Pioneer Village]], Orlich was the first of the thieves to get shot and killed in the ensuing firefight.

==Appearance==
Orlich has short, blond hair. He wears a black shirt, what appears to be a bulletproof vest, and gray pants. He also has on black-framed glasses, what appears to be a bluetooth earpiece, and a watch on his left wrist.

==Personality==
He seems to be extremely narcissistic, even willing to kill children to get what he wants. He also seems intelligent, knowing that [[Franz]] would try to run away with his "cut" in "[[Super Fun Time]]".

==Relationships==
===[[Franz]]===
In "[[Super Fun Time]]" he was shown to be in a group of thieves with Franz, however, their relationship seemed business-only, considering Orlich didn't trust that Franz would give him his "cut" of their stolen goods.
