The '''Pedophile Interviewee''' appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]".

==Background==
As [[the boys]] attempt to build a ladder to Heaven and retrieve [[Lolly's Candy Factory]] ticket from [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], several members of the public were interviewed on whether they believe in a ladder to Heaven. When asked, the pedophile instead visualizes Heaven as "an eight-year-old boy", and the ladder as his penis. As the camera quickly pans away from the man, he follows along and went on with his description, before being disrupted by the studio.

Later, when the man was asked if Heaven should be bombed, he makes a similar reply: this time visualizing [[Saddam Hussein]] as the "eight-year-old boy", and the [[United States]] as his penis. This interview is likewise disrupted by the studio.

==Appearance==
The pedophile is slightly overweight, has a protruding chin, large ears, and sports curled brown hair. He wears a bright green collared shirt and blue pants.
