{{LinkDisambig|Tony (Disambiguation)}}
'''Tony Hayward''' is the president of BP (later DP). He appears in the episodes "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" and "[[Mysterion Rises]]". He is largely responsible for the oil spill in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the subsequent leak of creatures from other dimensions, including [[Cthulhu]].

In response, he creates numerous "apology" videos which become more and more disturbingly erotic in nature.
