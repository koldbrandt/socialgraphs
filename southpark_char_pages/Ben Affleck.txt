'''Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt''', better known as '''Ben Affleck''', is an actor best known for his roles in ''Good Will Hunting'', ''Armageddon'', and ''Pearl Harbor''. He first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]".

==Background==
In "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]", when South Park Dairy post a picture of Kenny's butt on their cartons to help find a missing child, the Thompson family rush to the town believing that its their missing son, who like them suffers from torsonic polarity syndrome" or "TPS". When it is revealed to be a prank, the Thompsons and South Park Dairy search the world until they discover the Thompson's estranged son to be Ben Affleck. Mr. Garrison notes the similarities between the butt-faced parents and their actor son. In this episode, his face is shown to a photo-cut out of the real Ben Affleck.

Affleck appears again in "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", now voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and with a normally animated cartoon appearance. When a new singer going by the name the "Jennifer Lopez" replaces his then-girlfriend, the real [[Jennifer Lopez]], the couple fly to South Park, where Affleck foolishly fell deeply in love with "[[Mitch Conner|Ms. Lopez]]", who in truth was a crude imitation of Jennifer Lopez painted onto [[Eric Cartman]]'s hand in the vein of Senor Wences. Affleck and the hand proceed to share a whirlwind sexual romance (involving Cartman jerking off Affleck on multiple occasions, often without Cartman realizing it). However, when the real Lopez attempts to murder Cartman and the hand-Lopez, it is revealed that the new Jenny is a male con-artist named Mitch Conner, intent on pulling a job against everyone. Oblivious to what has transpired, Affleck is left heartbroken after Mitch "dies".

In the episode "[[Wing]]", he can be seen listening to [[Wing Han Tsang]] at [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s son's wedding.

Affleck and his ex-love Mitch Conner / Jennifer Lopez appear again in "[[200]]", as part of a group of celebrities intent on suing South Park, and also in stealing the anti-ridicule goo of the Muslim Prophet, [[Muhammad]].

In "[[Going Native]]", [[Butters Stotch]] expresses jealousy and rage at Affleck's relationship with Jennifer Lopez once again, only for a Hawaiian man to inform him that Affleck was now dating Jennifer Garner instead. Butters rage subsided and he said that Affleck did not have everything going for him after all.

==Appearance==
Affleck wears a dark gray, short-sleeve, shirt, brown belt, blue pants, and yellow sunglasses. He also has black combed hair.
