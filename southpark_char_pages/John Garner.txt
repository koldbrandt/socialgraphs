He explains what gluten is and where it is found, putting a lump of dough into a washer to extract pure concentrated gluten from it. Having recently gone gluten-free, [[Mr. Mackey]] challenges him to ingest this extract, which he does with initial hesitation. Shortly after, he begins moaning as his body burns and his penis flies off. Upon witnessing this, the audience flees the community center in horror.
