==Personality==
Due to her relatively short speaking role, little is known about her personality. In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", she was seen at [[Bebe Stevens]]' party, rubbing her hand on [[Token Black]] in a hot tub and later chasing [[Kyle Broflovski]]. However, since she was participating in the "Stupid Spoiled Whore" fad, we cannot interpret any accurate personality traits from these facts.
