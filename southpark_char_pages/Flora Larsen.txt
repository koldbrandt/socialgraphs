'''Flora Larsen''' is a [[Kindergartners|kindergartner]] girl. She made her first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Trapper Keeper]]". In the elections for kindergarten class she was undecided on who to vote for class president, but ultimately chose [[Ike Broflovski]] against [[Filmore Anderson]].

==Appearance==
Flora has short blonde hair with 2 bows in it and she has black eyes. She has fair skin. She also wears a light pink shirt, along with pink pants and black shoes. In some episodes, her shirt has a purple heart on it. 

In "[[Funnybot]]", she was seen in a dress that was the same color of her pants that she usually wears at the "[[1st Annual Comedy Awards]]". Later in the episode, she was seen in her normal clothes.

==Background==
Her name is likely a play on "Florida", as the state was undecided in the presidential election a few days before "[[Trapper Keeper]]" aired.

In "[[Royal Pudding]]", Flora was shown to be talented with the piano as she was shown playing it in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s play on "Tooth Decay".

In "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]", she had a cameo appearance, where she was shown on one of the [[Toilet Safety Administration|TSA's]] bathroom monitors sitting on a toilet.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
She appears as one of the six kindergarteners who hides in [[Hide 'n' Seek]]. After the player finds her, she befriends them. Her appearance changes a little as she is seen with a red heart on her shirt.

==Relationships==
===Family===
In the episode "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", it reveals that her sister is 4th grader [[Millie Larsen]] and they are seen with their mother [[Mrs. Larsen]]. They were at the zoo and Flora was seen in a stroller.

===Friends===
Flora has a possible friendship with [[Jenny (kindergartener)|Jenny]] and Filmore as she is seen hanging out with them in "[[Trapper Keeper]]", "[[Toilet Paper]]", "[[Butt Out]]", “[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", and "[[Tonsil Trouble]]".

==Personality==
Flora is a sweet and well-meaning but horribly indecisive little girl in the Kindergarten class. She has trouble making any kind of decision, whether it's a class presidential race or where to hide while playing hide and seek. Like her sister, she enjoys musical talents and likes to play the piano.
