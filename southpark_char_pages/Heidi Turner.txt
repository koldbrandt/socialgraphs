:''For the title of Simply Heidi, see ([[Simply Heidi]]).''
'''Heidi Turner''' is a student at [[South Park Elementary]]. Heidi is portrayed as one of the "popular girls" in the [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade]]. She is usually seen with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Annie Knitts|Annie]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], [[Lola]], and many other [[List of Female 4th Graders|4th grade girls]]. She hosted a sleepover in "[[Marjorine]]", at which most of the "popular girls" attended, once again illustrating her popularity. She has been shown with different parents in four separate instances, most likely continuity errors. She serves as the primary [[:Category:Female characters|female character]] in [[Season Twenty]] and [[Season Twenty-One|Twenty-One]].

==Background==
===Character Development===
Heidi went from being a minor background character that was introduced in [[Season Three]] to a much larger presence in ''[[South Park]]''. Like other characters used mostly in the background of the early seasons, her model would be used to fill in space and was occasionally given color swaps.

Later, as the series progressed, Heidi was given a permanent color scheme and eventually a name, making her more usable for recurring roles. She obtained further establishment in the episode "[[Marjorine]]", where she was shown more prominently, hosting a slumber party. In the episode, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] shows the male 4th graders a recording in which the girls, including Heidi, are seen using a "fortune-telling device". During Cartman's meeting, Heidi's full name is revealed for the first time. Cartman tells the boys that Heidi will be hosting a slumber party which will be a perfect opportunity for them to take the "fortune-telling device" from the girls, as well as learn out how to use it. The boys decide to set up [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' fake death and send him to the party disguised as a girl. After Butters' fake death, he arrives at [[South Park Elementary]] dressed as a girl and introduces himself to the class as [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]]. Heidi is seen in [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]]'s class for the first time.

[[File:Marjorine38.png|thumb|left|Heidi makes preparations for the slumber party.]]
[[Nancy Turner]] tells her that she also invited Marjorine to the party, much to Heidi's anger. At the party, all the girls pick on Marjorine for being ugly and flat with Heidi telling her that nobody wants her at the party and that she should leave. After the girls hear Marjorine crying in the bathroom, they apologize and decide to give her a makeover. Heidi gives Marjorine the "fortune-telling device" and teaches her how to use it, but after [[Thomas Turner]] revealed that there is a boy at the party. Marjorine takes the device and leaves.

Since then, she has kept her place in the girls' clique throughout the series. Her role had seemed to be gradually growing, but had not dropped off until "[[The Hobbit]]". Heidi became a key character in [[Season Twenty]], as she was forced off of social media by the internet troll [[Skankhunt42]], and eventually became Eric Cartman's girlfriend, joining with him to end the gender war engulfing the school.

In "[[Member Berries]]", before the volleyball game, she sits down during the American National Anthem and plays with the team. After the game, she asks [[PC Principal]] what he will do about Cartman, assuming he is lying about [[Skankhunt42]] and requests that PC Principal checks Cartman's phone. 

[[File:SkankHunt00005.png|thumb|Heidi tosses her phone into the river.]]
She quits social media in a dramatic way, by tossing her phone into the river in "[[Skank Hunt]]". The next day, she walks down the hallway with her head down as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] tells [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that she has quit Twitter for good. Heidi can be seen sitting in the library during [[Mr. Mackey]]'s Twitter funeral for her. When the girls are talking about taking action against Skankhunt42 on the playground, Heidi is standing with them. 

During "[[The Damned]]", when Cartman is walking alone in the hallway, Heidi calls to him and leads him to the park where she and other people who do not use Twitter go. There, she comforts him about his broken electronics after showing him the park. Later, she apologizes for accusing Cartman of being Skankhunt42, talks with him about his assembly, and becomes his friend. The next day, Heidi talks with Cartman about her lack of followers. At [[M Burgers]], Cartman and Heidi eat together. When he asks her if girls have balls, she offers to show him her vagina. 

She is seen in a relationship with Cartman during "[[Wieners Out]]", bringing him chocolate milk and receiving a necklace from him. At [[Sizzler]], Cartman and Heidi hold hands while talking with Kyle about the gains of women and Butters needing to be stopped. Cartman becomes defensive of her when Kyle says "we need the old Cartman back", thinking that he has an issue with his relationship with her. Heidi tells Kyle that the two of them are "out of it now" after leaving social media behind. 

[[File:DoucheAndADanish00005.png|thumb|left|Heidi and Cartman interrupt the fight between Nelly and Butters.]]
In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", Heidi delays the fight between [[Nelly]] and Butters with Cartman, giving him a kiss. She holds an assembly with Cartman to propose the idea of a school fundraiser for [[TrollTrace.com]] to stop the cyberbullying issues in South Park and the rest of the world. She talks about her school fundraiser, Danishes for Denmark, in [[Mrs. Nelson]]'s class before Mr. Garrison tries to teach the class, pretending that he is not running for president. While the students help with Danishes for Denmark, Heidi and Cartman sing "[[Let's Come Together As a School]]" together. Due to the [[List of Internet Trolls]] attacking [[Denmark]], nobody wants to buy danishes from Heidi's school fundraiser. Heidi runs away and cries when she realized her plan failed, resulting in Cartman comforting her. Later, she and Cartman send a VHS to Denmark in which she believes to know the source of the troll attack. 

At M Burgers, Heidi goes on a date with Cartman and talks with him about Kyle, worried about his relationship with Cartman and the rest of the boys during the events of "[[Fort Collins]]". Heidi and Cartman talk with Kyle in his bathroom about their plans with Denmark. She invites Kyle to her house, revealing her plan to identify Skankhunt42 using "Emoji Analysis", telling Cartman and Kyle she thinks Skankhunt42 is a student's parent. A Danish worker mentions her and her Emoji Analysis, helping the Danish locate the source of the troll attack. Heidi is mentioned when Kyle tells Cartman about the possibility of her finding out about his internet history. Cartman later lies to her to keep his internet history secret, and she believes him. 

During "[[Oh, Jeez]]", Heidi and Cartman sit on their park bench and talk about the results of the election. Cartman says he is scared for the future and Heidi agrees. Cartman talks with Heidi in her room and convinces her that going to Mars is the only way to save themselves from mankind's destruction. She says that she trusts him with everything she has and agrees to come along. She joins Cartman on his quest to go to Mars by walking to [[SpaceX]]'s headquarters, unaware of his plan to avoid getting his internet history being exposed. 

[[File:Heidi Emoji Analysis.png|thumb|Heidi's Emoji Analysis.]]
In "[[Members Only]]", Heidi and Cartman ask the SpaceX receptionist if they can go to Mars, but they end up having to wait in line. Heidi tells Cartman that she will miss everyone on Earth if they leave, reluctant to follow through with his plan. Cartman becomes defensive of Heidi when Butters claims to be feminist and asks her to tell him a joke. When the tour ends, Butters tells Elon Musk that Heidi might be able to help get to Mars sooner because she is really smart and really funny. When Kyle confronts Ike about Skankhunt42, he remembers Heidi's Emoji Analysis and figures out who the real troll is, realizing that Ike is not Skankhunt42. 

When Gerald FaceTime calls Ike, Kyle mentions that Heidi figured out Gerald was Skankhunt42 by using her Emoji Analysis in "[[Not Funny]]". Heidi admits that she does not know what the problem is with Elon's rocket science. Cartman reassures Elon that she is the funniest, smartest girl on Earth and gets mad at Butters when he compliments her. When Cartman tells Butters to back off because Heidi is everything to him, Butters tells him that girlfriends only want to make guys sad, but Cartman does not believe him. While Heidi is attempting to solve the problem, Cartman talks to Butters again, he tells Butters that Heidi is the smartest, funniest person he has ever met, not believing Butters about the girls' "hatred" for men. She uses Emoji Analysis to solve the rocket science problem, all while Cartman is trying to convince himself that she is still funny, not only smart. 

In Season Twenty's final episode, "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]", she admires the new energy source she helped create. Elon Musk walks away with her while Cartman's distrust in her grows even more. Heidi waves at Cartman through the window as Cartman attempts to convince Elon that women will take over the operation. Cartman mentions Heidi when talking to Butters, saying that he cannot live without her but does not want to be enslaved on Mars. Heidi tells Cartman that he seems distant, to which he apologizes and distracts her from the energy source being re-routed. Heidi thinks she is acting needy and Cartman agrees to be honest with her, even if it hurts her feelings. Heidi and Cartman watch SpaceX explode after the energy source was re-routed to the internet. Later, Heidi walks home with Cartman, leaving him with a kiss, only for him to wipe it off his face with a bitter expression. 

[[File:WPRH66.PNG|thumb|left|Heidi tells Cartman that "relationships are 50/50."]]
The first episode of Season 21, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]", explores the negative side of Heidi and Cartman's relationship. While Cartman and his friends are making [[Alexa]] say profanities, Heidi enters his house resulting in Cartman acting passive-aggressively towards her, annoying Heidi. Heidi then leaves his house, angry that he would not communicate his feelings. Later that night, Heidi calls Cartman and notes that he said "mobile phones are the devil", despite him using his phone regularly. He hangs up, annoyed, after wishing her a goodnight. Cartman mentions her to the guys when telling them that she changes like "Jekyll and Hyde" and "mentally abuses" him, claiming that she needs help, even though his claims are not true. Heidi is crying at her dining room table when Cartman comes and admits that he was wrong. When Heidi tells him that "relationships are 50/50", he becomes annoyed and tries to end their conversation quickly, mocking her on his way out when she says "I love you too". When he walks down the street, Heidi appears in his mind, expressing how she wants more communication in their relationship. Heidi later goes to Cartman's house and asks Liane to tell him that she wants to make him happy and she was wrong to say that "relationships are 50/50", they are "100/100", and she will put in one-hundred percent each day, that she will try harder. She wants Cartman to know that it is okay to be sad because "the sun will come out again". Cartman breaks up with her for not submitting herself to him, telling her that she is messed up and he cannot fix her. This leaves Heidi confused as he happily walks away. 

During the events of "[[Put It Down]]", when Cartman is giving Craig relationship advice, Heidi walks up to Cartman and asks him if they will spend time together at recess. Then, the boys ask him about their relationship, he claims that he took her back because she threatened suicide, even though she is still "mentally abusive", which is false. Heidi talks with Stan about Cartman because she is worried about him, telling him that after she and Cartman broke up, he said he was going to kill himself. She sends Cartman's voicemail to Stan, worried about Cartman's mental state. Cartman becomes angry about this and decides to make an anti-suicide campaign for himself. She helps Cartman raise his suicide awareness by holding a boombox while he sings [[Give Life A Try]]. In his song, he claims that his relationship with Heidi is like "livin' in quicksand" and she was messed up. When Cartman is trying to spread his suicide awareness outside the grocery store, Heidi helps pass out fliers. Later, Heidi tells Cartman that his website is becoming popular with others who need help, Cartman blames her for making him want to commit suicide. When Cartman tries to make his suicide prevention event bigger than the memorial service by the [[Distracted Driving Awareness|Distracted Driving Awareness Group]], Heidi tells him that "people need help sorting out their emotions sometimes", resulting in Cartman threatening to kill himself and running away. During Cartman's solo in "[[Put It Down (Song)|Put It Down]]", Heidi can be seen standing next to him when rapping about her making him crazy. 

[[File:SPFP48.png|thumb|Heidi asks Cartman what he was up to.]]
Although Heidi has a very small role in "[[Franchise Prequel]]", her relationship with Cartman becomes even more strained. While [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] gives his friends a motivational speech, she walks up to him and asks what he was up to, resulting in Cartman deflating. She then asks Cartman if he still wants to go to the park with her, cancelling the plans and leaving when Cartman acts passive-aggressively towards her. 

In "[[Hummels & Heroin]]", Heidi can be seen supporting [[Marcus Preston]] and his cause. Even though she only appears briefly, she does want something done about the opioid issue in South Park. 

Season 21's Halloween special, "[[Sons A Witches]]" explores the rising toxicity in Heidi and Cartman's relationship even more. Heidi takes a long time getting ready for their trip to the pumpkin patch, resulting in Cartman getting upset with her. Heidi, noticing that he is upset, asks if something is bothering him. When they are about to leave her house, Heidi asks for a picture, resulting in Cartman getting frustrated when she runs back inside to get her bracelet. When they do get to the pumpkin patch, they show up too late, making Cartman angrier. When [[Chip Duncan]] attacks the pumpkin patch, Heidi and Cartman are forced to leave, requiring Heidi to pull Cartman away from the pumpkin patch to get to safety. When they boys are talking about last night's witch attacks, Cartman glares at Heidi, angry about what happened the night before. She waves to him and he waves back, not breaking his gaze until Butters says "we've got to do something to get rid of her". Assuming they were talking about Heidi, he agrees with Butters. Later, he shows Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny his plan to kill Heidi. Kyle gets angry because they want to get rid of the witch, not Heidi. Cartman says that Heidi makes his life "a living hell" and Kyle tells him to break up with her because "Heidi's a nice girl", astonished how Cartman can treat her so badly. Cartman says that she has "no time-management skills whatsoever" and angrily leaves. When Mayor McDaniels holds an assembly about the issues the witch has caused in South Park, Cartman comes up with the idea of getting Heidi captured by the witch. Cartman tricks Heidi into coming with him to a "costume party" during school. Dressed as Hansel and Gretel, they walk through the forest. Heidi remembers that Cartman was angry she took so long getting ready for pumpkin patch, starting an argument. As revenge, Cartman leaves her alone and she gets captured by the witch. She is later rescued when President Garrison's orbital cannon kills Chip, taking extra time to leave the witch's bag. On Halloween, Cartman is waiting for Heidi to get ready for Trick-or-Treating and she takes her time, resulting in Cartman becoming annoyed once again. 
[[File:Sp-2107-press-art-image-01.jpg|thumb|left|Cartman introduces Heidi to "Beyond KFC"]]
In "[[Doubling Down]]", Cartman manipulates Heidi even more, further increasing the toxicity of their relationship. Heidi gets a call from Cartman and becomes annoyed when he cries into the phone, begging her to take him back. Heidi says that he called her a whore and tried pushing her in front of a car, so he blames it on his poor diet. Heidi tells him that he can not be mean to her and keep blaming it on his diet, so he blames his mother and yells at her. Heidi suggests a vegan diet, so he agrees to become vegan to get back with her. Cartman gets angry when Heidi packs his vegan lunch, calling her a "manipulative whore". Kyle gets mad at Cartman for calling Heidi such terrible things, confused why she still wants to be with him and Heidi walks up, offering to eat with Cartman and explain what she packed in his lunch. After school, Kyle talks to Heidi about her relationship with Cartman. She gets defensive when Kyle asks her why she is still with Cartman. At Heidi's house, Cartman tricks her into eating "Beyond KFC", ruining her vegan lifestyle with meat. In the hallway, Kyle thinks he knows why Heidi would not admit Cartman is a bad boyfriend. Butters thinks that Heidi could be telling the truth when Cartman asks if they have seen her recently. Cartman tells them that the have been trying new foods and Heidi has been gaining weight and she says that the "Beyond Arby's" might have made her feel sick. He makes weight jokes about her when she talks about leaving school. Kyle says that they need to help her after seeing what Cartman has been doing to her. Kyle talks with the girls about making Heidi feel bad about being with Cartman because she will double down, trying harder to prove that she did not make a bad decision. Butters thinks that Kyle was right before and that the boys should help Heidi break up, but Kyle tells him that they should stay out of it. Kyle then talks to Cartman about his relationship with Heidi, but he pulls out a drum and starts making fun of her weight. Kyle sees Heidi sitting alone in the school gym and talks to her about Cartman. She tells him that she keeps thinking Cartman will change, but Kyle tells her that people like Cartman always see themselves as the victims. He says that Cartman will always find someone to blame for his flaws and he will never change. She tells Kyle the circumstances she was in when she started dating Cartman. She then tells Kyle why she started dating Cartman, asking if that makes her a bad person. Kyle assures her that good people make bad decisions everyday. Heidi then has a montage with ''[[Unfaithful]]'' where she looks through a scrapbook of pictures she and Cartman took, she notices Kyle looking at her at school, she and Cartman are talking at the park bench and she leaves him, but he grabs onto her leg to slow her down, then Kyle gets a letter from Heidi and smiles after reading it, then Cartman bangs on the window to a restaurant Heidi and her parents are eating at, begging her to take him back. Kyle and Heidi talk with each other on the playground's swings. At [[Token Black|Token]]'s family dinner, Cartman finds out that Heidi has been dating Kyle. He then imagines Kyle as a giant, attempting to ruin his relationship with her. The next day, Cartman fights Kyle at school because he is dating Heidi, but goes down in one punch. Heidi eats at [[Buca De Faggoncini]] with the girls, but they continue to make her feel bad about dating Cartman so she decides to meet him at the park. Cartman takes her back and twists her beliefs, causing her to inadvertently call Kyle a "dirty Jew" and break up with him.    

[[File:SPMP - 00180.png|thumb|Heidi speaking at the podium.]]
"[[Moss Piglets]]" shows how her toxic relationship with Cartman has changed her life for the worst. She now resembles Cartman and acts similarly to him. At lunch,  [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] notes that "you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi". She then sits down with the girls and asks them what they are talking about. When they do not tell her, she accuses them of being "judgemental bitches". When Wendy tries to talk with her about her appearance, Heidi becomes aggressive towards her. After [[Theresa]] intervenes, Heidi mocks her. [[Mr. Mackey]] meets with her in his office to talk with her about judging the Special Ed Science Fair. At the bus stop, Heidi is standing with Wendy, [[Isla]], and Theresa. She rants about the science fair and claims to "know how it feels" to be a slave. Theresa gets annoyed so Heidi makes fun of her "tiny home", calling her house a "trailer" and her block a "trailer park". Wendy tells Theresa to ignore Heidi, resulting in Heidi saying she'd try, but Theresa is "such a bitch". Isla gets upset and Heidi mocks her, only for Cartman to walk up to her and ask what is up. Heidi deflates and acts annoyed when he comes over, similar to how he reacted to her earlier in the season. Heidi and Cartman walk down the hallway to talk with Butters about judging the school science fair. Butters says he cannot because he was going to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s birthday. Kyle says "some of their projects are pretty cool", resulting in Heidi and Cartman yelling "shut up Kyle!" at the same time. Then, they say "samesies!" and kiss each other. After she says that the science fair is not going to "contribute to society", Jerry Jones arrives in a helicopter and talks with [[PC Principal]] about the science fair. During recess, Heidi walks around Cartman, upset that the Special Ed kids are getting "all the support". Heidi then speaks at the podium for a school assembly about the school administration overfunding special education students, saying that everyone could end up as poor as Theresa. After arguing with Cartman about his support, Heidi says that if the school administration does not cancel the Special Ed Science Fair, she will have them all fired. This results in Mr. Mackey telling PC Principal "she's kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through." Heidi then gets PC Principal and Mr. Mackey to talk with Jerry Jones about cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair, but they hold everyone inside hostage. Heidi yells at Cartman for not being a supportive boyfriend and he calls her a bitch, resulting in her intimidating him into standing down, showing her newly acquired dominance in their relationship. Heidi steals the [[Water Bears]] and runs through the school, attempting to escape with them. When she is cornered, she drinks the water bears so she does not have to judge the fair. Later, she and Cartman watch TV at his house, where he is surprised that she drank the water bears. She demands he snuggles with her, to which Cartman reluctantly complies.

"[[SUPER HARD PCness]]" shows how both Heidi and Cartman enjoy being terrible together, antagonizing Kyle many times throughout the episode. She and Cartman physically fight in the school hallway over their plans for the evening, so Kyle breaks up the fight and tries to convince everyone that they have all been being mean to each other for too long, resulting in Heidi comparing him to his mother. Later that night, Heidi and Cartman go to Stan's house to watch the new Terrance and Phillip show. Upon seeing Kyle, she calls him his mother, surprising Kyle. When Kyle says that he feels bad for the person being farted on, Heidi says "Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off", resulting in everyone laughing at Kyle. Cartman and Heidi use the PA system to tell "Mrs. Broflovski" that "her" tampons are at the front desk, angering Kyle. The combination of Heidi and Cartman's actions inadvertently lead to Canada being nuked.

[[File:SPST - 00093.png|left|thumb|Heidi recognizes the victim mentality she has created in her relationship with Cartman.]]
Heidi and Cartman's relationship ends at the end of "[[Splatty Tomato]]". Tweek, Craig, Kyle, and Stan talk about seeing President Garrison, Heidi and Cartman join them. When the group decides to help Kyle look for Ike, Heidi gets mad with Cartman because it is supposed to be their date night. When Kyle says that he does not need anyone to come with him, she accuses Kyle of not wanting her around because he had “the hots” for her, but Kyle says that he would “never have the hots” for the person she is now, leaving her hurt. She walks with the group until they make it to the bridge where she threw her phone, reflecting on how different she was when she decided to throw her phone. She gets angry with Cartman when he tries to tell her to keep going, reminding him the bridge is where their whole relationship started. When group then makes it to the cabin, Heidi remembers that Cartman brought her there, telling her how his friends destroyed his electronics. She also remembers when they used to talk in the park for hours, asking why they would not do so anymore. When Cartman gets annoyed, she mentions how he used to be nice to her, resulting in him saying the same thing to her. She tells him she tried, but he always rolled his eyes at her, resulting in him doing just that. After Kyle finds Ike's toy binoculars, she realizes that they are in the same place Cartman took her on Halloween. She realized that Cartman tried getting her killed, yelling at her imaginary past-self. After Mr. Garrison is captured and brought to the Community Center, Heidi steals Bob White's pistol. She holds Cartman at gunpoint, blaming him for the person she has become, but realizes that she has been participating in self-victimization and breaks up with him for the last time. Cartman takes the gun and tries to threaten suicide, but Heidi sees through his trick, knowing his manipulative tactics, so as a result, the suicide attempt failed.

=== Criminal Record ===
Heidi has committed the following crimes during the series:
*'''Civil Unrest/Rioting:''' Participant in the South Park Elementary gender war during "[[Proper Condom Use]]". 
*'''Graft/Corruption:''' She, along with numerous other girls on the [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]], altered [[The List|the list of cutest boys]] so that [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] would be on the top, in order to get free shoes from him. This is graft because Heidi abused her authority for personal gain.
*'''Assault: '''Got in a fight with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] at the beginning of "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"
*'''Violation of Firearm Laws/Threatening with a deadly weapon:''' At the end of "[[Splatty Tomato]]", Heidi took the gun from [[Bob White|Mr. White's]] hands and points it at Cartman's head, blaming him for the person she became.
*'''Theft: '''In "[[Moss Piglets]]" Heidi steals [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy's]] Water Bears in order to make the school and the NFL cancel the Special Ed. Science Fair so she does not have to present herself as a judge.
*'''Sexual harassment:''' She is one of the many girls participating in Bebe's sex party in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", making unwanted sexual advancements to the male attendants.
*'''Property Damage:''' In "[[Moss Piglets]]", Heidi attempts to destroy Jimmy and Timmy's [[Water Bears]] by drinking them. They survive, but that does not justify the fact that she intentionally tried to get rid of someone else's property.
*'''Sedition:''' In [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the&nbsp;movie]], she was a member of La Resistance, a group with the goal of stopping the execution of [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the government. However, she did it to save the world from being ruled by [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Satan]], so it can be justified.

===Voice Acting===
She has had four voice actors throughout the series. Heidi is currently voiced by Jessica Mackinson, who has been voicing her since 2005. She was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', which was her first speaking role. From 2000 to 2001, she was voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]. [[Eliza J. Schneider]] voiced her from 2001 to 2005. In older seasons, her voice is similar to [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s voice.

==Appearance==
Heidi has light, ash-brown hair. Since "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", she wears a lime green jacket with a red collar, black trousers, and red gloves. In her initial appearance in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", she had black hair (though it was shown as its later brown shade in various shots) and wore an orange sweater when she was not in her choir uniform. She was also depicted with her former appearance in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', with her black hair and orange sweater.

When she was dressed like a whore in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", she wore a white crop-top and matching skirt, very similar to [[Sally Turner|Sally]]'s. When dressed for bed, she wears lavender plaid pajamas with a pink collar and pockets, as seen in "[[Marjorine]]".

She looks similar to [[Linda Triscotti]] and [[Karen McCormick]], who both wear the same clothes as Heidi. The only differences are their hairstyles, Heidi's lack of a hairclip, and differently colored hair.

In "[[Skank Hunt]]", she gains a red hat with pink, white, and purple accents; a purple flower is also attached to it.

Heidi starts to gain weight in "[[Doubling Down]]", following her discovery of "Beyond KFC". Her weight increases in "[[Moss Piglets]]", where she ends up being almost as fat as her boyfriend, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. She also appears to have developed facial acne while fat, with pimple clusters on her left cheek and above her right eye.

In "[[The Problem with a Poo]]", she had lost all the weight and facial acne looking like her normal self again, though she is still shown wearing her hat. In "[[Board Girls]]", she is no longer seen wearing her hat when the girls celebrate Heather Swanson's defeat. In "[[Bike Parade]]", Heidi can be seen riding in the bike parade wearing her hat with a flower pinned to it. However, in "[[The Pandemic Special]]", she is seen wearing her hat again with a pink mask.

{{GallerySubPage|name=Heidi Turner}}

==Personality==
Heidi is often sweet and socially friendly, although in earlier seasons she proved to sometimes be unkind to the point of cruelty. In "[[Marjorine]]", she initially displayed a dislike of the 'new girl' [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]], openly mocking her, despite later comforting her and offering her a makeover as an apology for their teasing. She is a "popular girl" among the 4th graders, and she was shown participating in the girls' meeting in "[[The List]]", discussing which girl's purse was the cutest. Since the major developmental growth of her character, and her promotion to a significant character in recent seasons, Heidi is always portrayed as a genial, thoughtful, cute, and sweet girl. Since [[Season Twenty]], she has been shown to be one of the nicest and most socially sensitive girls in [[South Park Elementary|South Park]], quitting social media after being horrendously bullied by a [[Skankhunt42|troll]].

In "[[Sons A Witches]]", it is shown that Heidi cares a lot about her appearance, and as a result, it takes her longer than usual to get ready for special events. According to Cartman, she has "no time management skills, whatsoever."

A negative attribute to her personality is that she is very prideful. This is the reason why she is willing to tolerate Cartman's abuse, as it was revealed in "[[Doubling Down]]" that she refuses to admit to her friends she made a bad decision by hooking up with Cartman, and when she does break up to with him, her friends mock her for ever dating him in the first place. This resulted in her getting back together with Cartman and allowing him to manipulate her emotions. In the following episode, "[[Moss Piglets]]", Heidi became menacing, wicked, and dejected.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, "[[Splatty Tomato]]", Heidi hits her breaking point and was prepared to kill Cartman, blaming him for her negative personality change. She would soon come to realize that Cartman was not the one who caused it but her own victim mentality. She decides to abandon the victim mentality and break up with Cartman.

As she appeared as her old self prior to her weight gain in "[[The Problem with a Poo]]", it can be assumed that she has also reclaimed her kind and caring personality as well.

==Family==
===Parents===
[[File:Heidi and her parents.png|thumb|Heidi hugs her parents before leaving in "[[Sons A Witches]]".]]
Heidi and her parents were first seen in the story arc "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" and "[[Probably]]". When [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] founded his church and the parents were trying to convince their kids to come back, Heidi went inside. Her dad told her to come back, but then a beam from the roof of Cartman's poorly made church landed on him, killing him after she stated she did not want to go to Hell. Although her father was dead, he was later shown alive in "[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]", telling his wife that he regrets cheating on her with another woman. She has a different set of parents in "[[Marjorine]]". Further, in "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" she was shown yet again with a different set of parents and [[Boy with Blond Hair|a possible sibling]]. Her latest, again different, parents were shown at the end of "[[Proper Condom Use]]", and in "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]". All of these are likely continuity errors.

===Pet===
[[File:HeidiCry.png|thumb|right|Heidi crying next to Robby.]]
After [[Timmy]] sends [[Gobbles]] away during "[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]", Heidi is seen crying and screaming, "No, [[Robby]]! No!" over a dog's body, that appears to have been run over by a car. It is likely that Robby was her pet.

==Relationships==
===[[Eric Cartman]]===
[[File:DoucheAndADanish00015.png|thumb|Heidi and Eric holding hands.]]
Their relationship goes all the way back to [[Season Four]]'s "[[Probably]]", where her parents arrived to pick her up from Cartman's church. Cartman convinced them to let her stay, for selfish reasons, so she can be "saved". Here, she was named "Marcy".

They were paired together in "[[Follow That Egg!]]". Heidi was displeased when she was paired with him. Cartman, however, did show remorse for breaking the egg and asked [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] to let her pass and have him fail. However, this was done for a selfish reason, as Cartman figured an A and an F would average out to a C-. Since that episode, Heidi and Cartman did not interact with each other, until in "[[Stunning and Brave]]". In that episode, Cartman calls Heidi ‘clitty litter’, which may suggest that even Heidi does not get along with him.

However, Heidi and Cartman developed a relationship starting in "[[The Damned]]", where she goes on to show Cartman a life outside of social media. In "[[Wieners Out]]", the two are confirmed to be a couple, and in a "[[Douche and a Danish]]", they surprised their classmates by kissing. The couple worked together to help Denmark get [[TrollTrace.com]] up and running. They even sing a song named [[Let's Come Together As a School]] with each other when the children were making danishes for the fundraiser.

In "[[Fort Collins]]", Cartman is unable to tell Heidi about his bigotry in the past and lies to her about an incident with Jimmy. Their relationship becomes strained in "[[Not Funny]]" when Heidi is focusing all her attention on solving the rocket problem. However, at the end of [[Season Twenty]], Heidi and Cartman are still together.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]", their relationship becomes strained. Cartman begins to be annoyed with Heidi for not being submissive to him. He blames her for his unhappiness in their relationship, accusing her of being mentally abusive. Heidi grows confused, and cries, as she cannot figure out why Cartman has been acting so indifferent towards her. At the end of the episode, Cartman breaks up with Heidi and leaves her heartbroken.

In the following episode, "[[Put It Down]]", Cartman leaves Heidi a voicemail, threatening her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back. Worried about him, Heidi accepts this, and they get back together.

The toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Sons A Witches]]". In the episode, Cartman grows frustrated with Heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together. Instead of telling her how he felt, he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt he'd feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that “Heidi is a nice girl”, and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly. Cartman dismisses this, and later he convinces Heidi to dress up as Gretel while dressing himself up as Hansel. Immediately after he takes Heidi into the woods with him at night, and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die, and gets her kidnapped by a witch.

It was revealed in the episode, "[[Doubling Down]]", that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are directly influenced by the other girls, who laugh at her and tease her for ever dating him, albeit playfully. They also expressed concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. Kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. After breaking up with Cartman the girls take Heidi out for dinner at Buca De Faggoncini, where they again chastise Heidi repeatedly for dating Cartman (all except Lola, who notes that Heidi already admitted she made a mistake). It soon comes to light that Heidi has become Kyle's girlfriend, angering Cartman. Cartman recognizes Heidi's confusion about what she wants and uses this to manipulate Heidi into taking him back while making her unintentionally prejudiced against Jews.

In the episode, "[[Moss Piglets]]", we see the result of the toxicity of Cartman and Heidi's relationship. Heidi begins to inherit several of Cartman's traits including his obesity, accent, and attitude, but even lazier, louder, and more obnoxious than he is. Heidi had now become practically a female version of Cartman, turning into an emotionally damaged bully with really aggressive tendencies, so much to the point that Cartman himself is at times intimidated by her. Despite Cartman being clearly unhappy with what he turned Heidi into, he was desperate to keep Heidi all to himself no matter how demeaning and selfish Heidi became since he will be lonely all over again without her. Cartman and Heidi switched attitudes in their relationship, and Heidi grew irritated with Cartman, while Cartman became more compassionate, acting much nicer to her. Eventually, Cartman has enough of Heidi's antics and begs her to go back to being the sweet girl she once was, only for Heidi to refuse.

In "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]", Eric and Heidi enjoy being awful together, getting into a fistfight, and watching the premiere of [[Terrance and Phillip]] on ''Netflix''. This parallels their early relationship from [[Season Twenty]] and proves that their dynamic is healthiest when they were both either at their best or at their worst.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, "[[Splatty Tomato]]", Heidi battles with her inner conscience over her relationship with Eric. While walking with the boys through the forest, they pass landmarks from the previous season, including the bridge Heidi threw her phone into when she quit social media. She recounts and reassesses the events that lead her to meet Eric Cartman, and what made her fall for him.  She later recognized the place where she was kidnapped by the witch from Halloween and Cartman had her dress up as Gretel realizing Cartman tried to have her killed. She then held Cartman at gunpoint blaming him for the person she became, but soon realized she has been engaging in self-victimization ever since she has been seeing Cartman.  She decides to abandon the victim mentality and break up with Cartman. Cartman tries to get Heidi to take him back by threatening suicide but the attempt failed as Heidi is now fully aware of Cartman's manipulative nature and simply leaves him.

The two have not had any onscreen interactions since then, but it can be assumed that they are currently on bad terms since their final break-up. Heidi is shown sitting far from Cartman in her two appearances in "[[The Problem with a Poo]]" implying that she is intentionally trying to avoid him. In "[[Basic Cable]]", [[Scott Malkinson]] asks Cartman for love advice mentioning how he and Heidi were together a long time and Cartman tells Scott that girls and relationships are "diabetes times ten" showing that Cartman is still bitter about the break-up.

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
[[File:SPDD - 00099.png|thumb|Heidi and Kyle in "[[Doubling Down]]".]]
Kyle first becomes concerned for Heidi in "[[Sons A Witches]]", when Cartman devises plans to kill her off right in front of him. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that "Heidi is a nice girl", and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly.

They briefly dated in the episode, "[[Doubling Down]]", after Kyle convinced Heidi to break up with Cartman, and they develop mutual feelings for each other. However Heidi breaks up with Kyle, inadvertently calling him a "dirty Jew", shocking him. She walks away with Cartman, who manipulated her into taking him back.

In "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]", Heidi teases Kyle by comparing him to his mother. 

In "[[Splatty Tomato]]", Heidi accuses Kyle of not wanting her around because he had a crush on her and she rejected him. In response, Kyle says he'd never be interested in who she is now, leaving her hurt. This implies that she felt remorseful for how horrible she had become, thanks to Cartman's manipulative influence on her. 

In "[[The Problem with a Poo]]", Heidi returns to her old self and sits behind Kyle in the music room with the two showing no hostility, implying that they are now on amicable terms. However, it is unclear if they still have feelings for each other or not as they have not interacted with each other since then.

=== [[Bebe Stevens]] ===
[[File:Sp-2002-news-episode-announcement.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Bebe and another girl cry about Heidi quitting Twitter.]]
Bebe appears to be very close to Heidi, possibly best friends. They usually are seen talking together and eating lunch with each other on multiple occasions.

In "[[Marjorine]]", Bebe and the popular girls were invited to Heidi's sleepover.

In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Bebe and another girl can be seen crying in the hallway after Heidi quits Twitter. Later, Bebe breaks down and starts crying while [[Mr. Mackey]] holds a memorial service for Heidi on [[Twitter]].

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", Bebe is so shocked to see that Heidi is in a relationship with Cartman that she vomits.

===[[Butters Stotch]]===
In "[[Marjorine]]", she was angry that Marjorine, who was Butters in disguise, was coming to her sleepover. Heidi was the one that insulted Marjorine in the first place, although after seeing how much she had upset "her", she felt guilty and tried to cheer "her" up.

In "[[Members Only]]", Butters appears to get along with Heidi very well after he starts copying Cartman's behavior around her, much to Cartman's annoyance.

In "[[Moss Piglets]]", she tries to burden Butters into taking her role in judging the Special Ed Science Fair, despite Clyde stating that he invited Butters to his birthday party.

==="[[Getting Gay With Kids]]"===
Her earliest appearance in the show was in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", as part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, though her first appearance as a South Park resident was in the background in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", watching their fight and in Home Economics.

===The Girls===
[[File:DoublingDownGirls.JPG|thumb|The girls take Heidi to dinner at Buca De Faggoncini.]]
Heidi seems to be in good relations with all members of the popular girls' clique. She is often paired up with one of the other girls either talking with them in the background or playing with them in the schoolyard, mainly [[Esther]]. She is usually eating with them during lunch time. When she hosted a slumber party at her house, she invited nearly all the girls in her clique.

In "[[The List]]", Heidi is a member of the girls' [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]].

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", the girls are all shocked to see that Heidi is in a relationship with Cartman, [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] faints and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] vomits.

In the episode, "[[Doubling Down]]", Kyle discovers that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are later revealed to be directly influenced by the girls, who laugh at her and tease her for dating him, albeit playfully. Not intentionally trying to hurt her feelings. They also express concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. They later all treat her and take her out for lunch, trying to make her feel better which ultimately falls apart when Cartman is mentioned. All the girls rip on him, resulting in Heidi going back to Cartman and "doubling down".

In the episode, "[[Moss Piglets]]", the girls notice how Heidi has changed, and express their concern for her as they watch her evolve into an entirely different person. Heidi's relationship with Cartman caused her to become deeply and emotionally deterred. Her attitude changed and all throughout the episode she acts savagely toward the girls, ripping into them, and teasing them. This is obviously meant to parallel Cartman's treatment of the boys, except with clearer roots.

In the episode "[[Splatty Tomato]]", she returns to them after she breaks up with Cartman.

In the episode, "[[The Problem with a Poo]]", she appears to be back on good terms with the girls as she is shown sitting with them during a school assembly.

In the episode "[[Board Girls]]", she is seen celebrating [[Heather Swanson]]'s defeat with the other members of the Board Girls Gaming Club.

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
Heidi Turner appears in the girls' secret base, The [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]]. After "[[Pose as Bebe's Boyfriend]]", it is revealed that she did not make the Facebook post mentioning that the [[New Kid]] is Bebe's boyfriend, so the girls suspect she is the "two-faced bitch". During "[[Unplanned Parenthood]]" the New Kid takes a picture of the abortion records and takes them back to get girls. The New Kid heads to Canada in "[[Heading North]]" and then finds the [[Minister of Montreal]] at the end of "[[O Canada (Quest)|O Canada]]". Heidi is revealed to be the two-faced bitch when the translated abortion records reveal that her mother had been to the abortion clinic. However, the girls soon forgive her since she said she was really sorry. She can then comment that the New Kid should stay as a girl, since it would be "so much better". During "[[Beat Up Clyde]]", Heidi and the rest of the New Kid's allies storm Clyde's fortress. Inside the fortress, Heidi is fighting Clyde's troops with the other factions the New Kid brought in the attack.

== ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]'' ==
Heidi messages the New Kid after they get the Indian Tunic, suggesting that they try it on. She teaches the New Kid how to change their clothes and how to change the coloring of their clothes.
