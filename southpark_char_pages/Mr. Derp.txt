'''Mr. Derp''' is a chef who first appears in "[[The Succubus]]". He was a temporary replacement for [[Chef]] when he left due to his impending marriage. Chef later took his job back, however, due to Chef's death in "[[The Return of Chef]]", Mr. Derp may have resumed his duty as [[South Park Elementary]]'s chef.

==Background==
===Role===
In "[[The Succubus]]", he temporarily replaced [[Chef]] as the school's cafeteria worker. When [[The Boys|the boys]] ask what happened to Chef, Mr. Derp informs them that Chef quit, but if they liked Chef, they're going to "love Mr. Derp". Mr. Derp is of course replaced, but continued to make brief cameos. In "[[Timmy 2000]]", he's seen in charge of the lemonade stand at the concert. He's seen in the foreground of the amusement park in both "[[Cartmanland]]" and "[[Professor Chaos]]". Later, he is briefly seen in Jimmy's dream in "[[Erection Day]]" and running out of the school in "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]". After "[[The Return of Chef]]", he may be his replacement as he was seen in the background in "[[Eek, A Penis!]]", running out of the school in "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]". In "[[Crème Fraiche]]", [[Randy Marsh]] was seen as the school chef and it is unknown if Mr. Derp still holds a position as part of [[South Park Elementary]]'s faculty.

===Name===
His name, according to the commentary on the episode, comes from a word invented by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] themselves, which they say means "an obvious joke" or is said when they do something dumb.

==Appearance==
He has facial wrinkles, a large nose, short brown hair, thick, brown eyebrows, and a thick, brown mustache. He wears a black hairnet, a small, white chef hat, and a dark, dull green, long-sleeve shirt. He also wears an orange apron which reads, "Come an' get it!".
