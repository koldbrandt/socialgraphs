'''Dr. Gauche''' is a medical doctor who works in [[Hell's Pass Hospital]]. He appears throughout the series as a minor character. He replaced [[Dr. Doctor]] in recent episodes.

The poster near his office state that he also works for Saint Penmar Department of Medicine, as seen in "[[Shots|Shots!!!]]".

==Background==
He was first seen in "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]", treating [[PC Principal]] who had been hearing Hootie and the Blowfish in his mind since he fell in love with [[Strong Woman]].

In "[[Shots|Shots!!!]]", it is revealed that he is trying to help [[Liane Cartman]] vaccinate her son, [[Eric Cartman]], on a weekly basis, failing each-time, while Eric gets off with a toy from the toy chest. After [[Big Mesquite Murph]] also fails in the task, this doctor is shown as one of the sponsors of the [[South Park (Location)|town]]'s vaccination rodeo, appearing on larges Pro-Vaccination signs throughout the ring.

In "[[Turd Burglars]]", he explains to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Ike Broflovski]] that [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] has a bacterial infection and will be treated with a fecal transplant. Later on, he explains to [[Harrison Yates]] that half of South Park has a bacterial disease. He explains this is due to the moms using a turkey baster for DIY fecal transplants since the turkey basters haven't been used for a year and therefore are teeming with bacteria.

==Appearance==
Dr. Gauche has gray hair and glasses. He wears standard doctors' clothing and has his stethoscope around his neck. He is also visibly aged.

==Trivia==
*The diploma on his office's wall states that he is a graduate of the [[University of the Mountains]].
