'''Caitlyn Marie Jenner''', formerly '''Bruce Jenner''', is a retired American athlete and is currently the 48th Vice President of the United States under [[Herbert Garrison]]. She transitioned into a female because of how she felt throughout her life as a man. The main focus of the episode "[[Stunning and Brave]]" is how [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] does not believe she is a hero for coming out as transgender.

==Background==
In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", a man who read [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' book ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]],'' murders the [[Kardashians]], including Bruce Jenner. The book was written by Butters himself and went on to critical acclaim as well as controversy.

Caitlyn Jenner was first mentioned in "[[Stunning and Brave]]" when [[PC Principal]] reprimands and sends Kyle to detention for saying she is not a hero. Later on in the episode, Kyle takes back this statement in desperation to stop [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] attack on the [[PC Delta|PC house]] and to stop being targeted by PC Principal and [[Randy Marsh]].

In "[[Where My Country Gone?]]", Kyle meets Jenner during a speech given by [[Barack Obama|Obama]] celebrating Kyle's newfound tolerance speech. Obama surprises Kyle during the speech, saying that he'll get to ride back to South Park "by his hero." As they leave the [[White House]], Jenner carelessly runs over and kills a pedestrian. At the end of the episode, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] announces his candidacy for president, and announces Caitlyn Jenner as his running mate, meaning that Caitlyn Jenner was a Mr. Garrison supporter. Much like before, she and Garrison drive away, only for her to hit and kill a pedestrian as they leave.

Caitlyn reappears in "[[Sponsored Content]]" where she aids Mr. Garrison in his debate against [[Hillary Clinton]]. She steps in during the debate to say that Hillary looks like a donkey took a shit on her face. After hearing about the conspiracy in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], she later drives Mr. Garrison and [[Principal Victoria]] back to South Park. Much like before, she winds hitting and killing a pedestrian along the way. This time, she runs over an entire crowd of people.

In "[[Truth and Advertising]]", they are shocked to see what has happened to the town since they left. She assists Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria in an attack against the [[PC Bros]].

==Appearance==
Jenner is shown to have severely deformed facial features, in reference to her real-life facial feminization surgery.
