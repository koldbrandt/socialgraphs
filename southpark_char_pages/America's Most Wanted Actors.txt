The '''America's Most Wanted actors''' appear in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", where they were re-enacting the attempted assassination of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]].

==Background==
Continued from "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] used the $3,000 won from [[America's Stupidest Home Videos]] to hire genetic scientist [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] in order to test the DNA of everyone in town. This test would have, hopefully, revealed who Cartman's father was. An assassin, who later is revealed to be Dr. Mephesto's brother, shot Dr. Mephesto before the secret was revealed.

The America's Most Wanted television show came to do a re-enactment of the shooting and hired several actors, to try to solve the mystery of who Dr. Mephesto's assailant could be. With the help of public participation, using a 1-800 number, they hoped to gather clues and evidence from the show's viewers.

When the power was knocked out at the studio, and the group of people were snowed in, the civilians and America's Most Wanted employees began to cannibalize each other to stay alive. In the end, only [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Ned Gerblansky]], [[Herbert Garrison]], [[Mayor McDaniels]], [[Officer Barbrady]], the camera man, and the boom mike holder from the America's Most Wanted team, come out of the studio, leaving the actors' fates unknown.

All of the real people tried out for parts to play themselves only to be replaced by local actors for the roles of Dr. Mephesto, [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]], [[Officer Barbrady]], and well known actor, [[Eric Roberts]] to portray Dr. Mephesto's mutant clone assistant, [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto#Kevin Mephesto|Kevin]].

==Appearance==
The actors are dressed in similar attire to Mr. Garrison, Dr. Mephesto, Chef, Mr. Hat, and Kevin. Rather than being proportional in stature and weight to the actual characters, such as with Mr. Hat and Kevin, the actors are all fully grown adults with average weight.
