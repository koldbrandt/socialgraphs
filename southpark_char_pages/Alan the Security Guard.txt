'''Alan''' is a security guard, often partnered with [[Mark the Security Guard|Mark]] seen in "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]" and "[[Trapper Keeper]]".

==Background==
In "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]", he and Mark are watchmen at [[Mt. Peaceful Cemetery]]. They warn [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] about [[Cleo Broflovski]]'s stolen corpse. They say that it had been stolen for the purpose of having sex with it. Unbeknownst to them, [[the boys]] had dug it up to scare [[The 6th Graders|the 5th graders]]. In addition to warning the townsfolk about the stolen body, they also go into graphic detail of what necrophilia is and how it is performed.

In "[[Trapper Keeper]]", he and Mark are stationed at [[Cheyenne Mountain]]'s military base. Alan and many other people cannot tell [[Rosie O'Donnell]] apart from the [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]/[[Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura S 2000|Trapper Keeper]] blob. He survives the disaster.

==Appearance==
Alan has blond hair and wears square black-framed glasses. He wears a dark blue security guard's uniform compromising a collared shirt, a black tie, a black belt with a gold buckle, pants, and black shoes.

==Personality==
He appears to be of relatively low intelligence, not realizing how dangerous the Cartman/Trapper Keeper hybrid was despite its grotesque, ominous appearance.
