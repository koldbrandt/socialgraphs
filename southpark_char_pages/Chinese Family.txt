The '''Chinese Family''' is a family who first appears in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[The China Probrem]]".

==Background==
The Chinese family dines at [[P.F. Chang's]], when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who were in stereotypical Chinese costumes, try to talk to them to find out the "Chinese plan". The father of the family, who knew how to speak English and that Cartman and Butters were not Chinese, gets annoyed and calls the waitress to have the two leave them alone. When the waitress is about to expel the two, Cartman and Butters then keep everyone in the restaurant hostage with Butters holding a gun.

The mother has long black hair and wears mascara, pink lipstick, and small white earrings on both ears. She wears a gray sports shirt with white stripes on the sides, darker gray sports pants that also have white stripes on the sides, and black shoes.

The youngest son has a tuft of black hair and wears a light blue button-down shirt and brown pants. He seems to be in kindergarten.
