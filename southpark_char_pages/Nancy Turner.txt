:''For the 4th grader that appeared in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]", see [[Nancy]].''
'''Nancy Turner''' is [[Heidi Turner]]'s mother, as Heidi has been seen with three sets of parents. She was first shown in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[Marjorine]]", at Heidi's slumber party. Heidi's other mothers, seen in "[[Probably]]" and "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", were likely the result of her character model not being finalized, as she is normally a background character.

Her name was revealed in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', during the quests to recruit the girls.
