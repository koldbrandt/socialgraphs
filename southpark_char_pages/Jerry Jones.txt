After [[Dan Snyder]] loses the rights to the Washington Redskins name, he calls a meeting of the [[NFL_Owners_and_Presidents|NFL owners]] and asks for help. During the meeting he states that Jerry Jones' eyes are "too far apart", which Jones disputes. Later in the episode, Jones is seen recieving a blowjob from an unnamed woman with his eyes (which are definitely too far apart) bulging out and pointing in different directions.

He is seen again in "[[Moss Piglets]]" holding special needs children hostage.
