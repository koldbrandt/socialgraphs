The '''Alien Pilots''' are [[Visitors]] fought in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

==Background==
In [[Alien Abduction]], the Alien Pilot and the Alien Co-Pilot serve as commanders of the alien spaceship that abducted [[The New Kid]]. The New Kid manages to break free and made his way to the cockpit, where he encounters the pilots. When the Alien Pilot reaches a low amount of HP, he runs away leaving his hat behind, causing the Alien Cockpilot to put on the hat and activate an attack named 'So Be It'. When they are defeated, the U.F.O. loses control and crashes to Earth, causing the green goo to leak out of it and into the drains of South Park.
