The '''Quadriplegic Swiss Man on a Pony''' is a [[Channel 4 News]] reporter who appears in the episode "[[Mecha-Streisand]]". 

His appearance lives up to his name, continuing a running joke of reporters with strange names or quirks, such as [[Midget Wearing a Bikini]], [[Tom Pusslicker]], [[Sandy Cervix]], and [[Chris Swollenballs]].

==Appearance==
The Quadriplegic Swiss Man on a Pony has no limbs and is strapped to a brown pony, as his name suggests. He wears green pants, a white shirt, black suspenders, and a green hat with a red feather in it, in what is intended to be a stereotypical Swedish outfit. He also wears a Channel 4 News badge on his shirt.
