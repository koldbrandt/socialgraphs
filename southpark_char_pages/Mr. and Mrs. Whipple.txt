'''Brian Whipple and Mrs. Whipple''' appear in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]". They took in [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who was playing as Mantequilla, in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s game, [[Texans vs. Mexicans]].

==Background==
In "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", Butters got lost when he got separated from the others during a game of [[Texans vs. Mexicans]]. The Whipples hit Butters with their car while he was trying to find his way back to [[Eric Cartman]]'s house. They took him in, gave him a place to stay, taught him how to clean, and taught him how to do laundry. After Butters expressed his wishes to return to his family, the Whipples dropped him off at an [[El Pollo Loco]].

The Whipples appear to be religious, due to the many Christian icons and slogans decorating their walls.

==Appearance==
Brian Whipple wears a light blue-gray shirt, a gray coat, khaki slacks and a red belt. He also wears black dress shoes and has combed brown hair.

Mrs. Whipple wears black high-heeled shoes, a black skirt, a pink blouse, and a blue undershirt. She has short, blonde hair and wears a conservative amount of makeup.

==Personality==
The Whipples were very nice to Butters, although they seem condescending and naive to who he actually is. They treat him like a servant, they teach him to wash the windows a bottle of glass cleaner and have him wash the dishes. Brian Whipple even bought him a gas powered leaf blower as a "gift" and taught him how to use it. Not realizing that Butters is actually an American boy, they ignorantly take him to an El Pollo Loco restaurant to "be with his own kind".
