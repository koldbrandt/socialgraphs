}}
'''Lil' Kim''' is a rapper and singer. She appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[You Got F'd in the A]]".

==Background==
She was one of the judges of the dance fight in the True-Value parking lot between [[Stan Marsh]]'s team and [[The Orange County Crew]], for the winner to make an appearance in her music video.

==Appearance==
Lil' Kim wears a gold bikini and short jeans, bracelets, and sunglasses. She also wears a gold chain with her name near her huge silicone breasts. She has long black hair and wears a lot of makeup.

Ironically, despite her voice for her rap songs, she has an exaggerated high pitched voice, the creators took the rapper's stage name to the extreme, creating her in a dwarf-like version called "Little Kim".
