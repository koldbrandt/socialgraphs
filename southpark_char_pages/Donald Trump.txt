'''Donald John Trump''' is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who appears in the [[Season Five]] episode "[[The Entity]]".

In real-life, he was the 45th President of the United States. However, he is not directly portrayed as such in the show, he is instead parodied by having [[Mr. Garrison]] becoming the President. In the 2020 Presidential Election, major news organizations have projected that Trump lost his bid for re-election.

==Background==
Mr. Garrison, tired of the airline check-ins, designed a new way of transport, known as [[IT]]. He invites a group of rich and famous people to view IT. Trump is shown to be impressed with it.

==Appearance==
Donald Trump wears a black jacket and a white shirt. He is shown to have wrinkles.

==Trivia==
*There have been many parodies of Donald Trump in the series.
**In "[[Where My Country Gone?]]", a [[Canadian President|Canadian version]] of Donald Trump appeared. He built a wall to keep all the Americans out. Mr. Garrison traveled to [[Canada]] and fucked him to death.
**In [[Season Twenty]], due to the [[Canadian President|Canadian version]] being killed off, Mr. Garrison replaced Donald Trump in the 2016 election. He realized he does not know what he is doing and tried to get people to vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] but eventually, due to the [[Memberberries]], became president, like Trump in real life.
