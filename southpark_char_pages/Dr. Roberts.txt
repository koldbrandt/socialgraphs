'''Dr. Roberts''' is [[Eric Cartman]]'s dentist, who appears in the [[Season Four]] episode "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]". 

==Background==
[[Liane Cartman]] called Dr. Roberts after some concern that Cartman had lost 112 baby teeth. Cartman used the teeth in order to receive Tooth Fairy money to save for a [[List of Video Game References#Sega Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]]. Dr. Roberts was unable to provide advice to Liane due to the American Dental Association convention.

At the convention he spoke to the audience about reports of missing teeth. He provided a farfetched reason, that everyone in the audience, except [[Tom Foley]] took as truth, as to who the culprit of the missing teeth was. He described a giant half-chicken/half-squirrel with a "mild understanding of algebra". He also stated that the creature would steal either the money or the teeth from children to build a nest for its dangerous offspring.

==Appearance==
Dr. Roberts wears a light-teal dentist lab coat over a red vest with yellow buttons, which is also over white button shirt with a thin black tie. He is bald, wrinkles on his forehead and chin, and black eyebrows. Roberts' coat has a tag that says ADA, which stands for the [[American Dental Association]]. Roberts also has a dental tool in his coat pocket.
