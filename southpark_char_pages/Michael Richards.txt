==Personality==
He seemed to be intelligent, even being able to devise a plan to get the word "n****r-guy" banned. He also appears to be easily offended, though, as the only reason he wanted "n****r-guy" banned was that people were using it to discriminate against him.

==Trivia==
*Richards is known for his infamous racist remarks made during the 2006 Laugh Factory incident where he angrily uses the n-word in his stand-up show and after an African American audience heckled him. This incident brought about the idea of producing "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]".
