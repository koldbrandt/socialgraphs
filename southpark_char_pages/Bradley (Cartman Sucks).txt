'''Bradley''' was [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' "Acountabilibuddy" at [[Camp New Grace]] in "[[Cartman Sucks]]". He got himself and Butters in trouble by having a men's underwear catalog in his room. After Butters, not getting what he meant, said he 'like-liked' him, he admitted having "bad thoughts" about their friendship. Bradley tried to commit suicide by attempting to jump off a bridge later in the episode, saying he was incapable of being cured. After Butters gives his speech, he gets down safely.

During the [[Season Seventeen]] intro, Bradley can be seen fishing off the bridge with the counselor from Camp New Grace as the school bus passes.
