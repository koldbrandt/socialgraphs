The '''[[Medicinal Fried Chicken (Location)|Medicinal Fried Chicken]] Clerk''' appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]".

==Background==
[[The Boys]] discover that their local [[Kentucky Fried Chicken|KFC]] restaurant has been replaced with a medicinal marijuana store. When [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] visits the store, the clerk informs him that pot is now legal, much to the joy of Randy.

Randy gives himself testicular cancer that made his balls grow into huge proportions, such as he could obtain marijuana legally. His balls eventually grew so large that he could not fit through the door of the marijuana store, with the clerk asserting that he is not permitted to sell marijuana outside of the store.

This eventually led to a protest involving other men with huge testicles. The clerk watches the men protest outside the store, commenting that many people are abusing the medicinal system, and that pot should have been made legal altogether.

==Appearance==
The Medicinal Fried Chicken clerk has balding brown hair. He wears a lab coat over a pink shirt with gray patterns, and blue pants.
