{{LinkDisambig|Christopher (Disambiguation)}}
'''Chris''' is the father of [[The New Kid]], who appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Chris, along with [[Kelly (Mom)|Kelly]] and the New Kid, moves to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] at the start of the game. Chris demands the New Kid go out and makes some new friends. He then doesn't do much for the first 2 days besides grounding the New Kid when they get lost in the forest or don't come home at night. Unlike Kelly, Chris will not allow his child to friend him until they already have at least 50 friends, claiming that only then will he "be impressed."

====Defeat the [[Underpants Gnomes]]====
When the New Kid is chasing the Gnomes, they find Chris and Kelly speaking to each other, worried about them. The two then make love, which can be heard throughout the walls. The New Kid meets up with the Warlock leader and a boss fight then commences upon the bed Chris and Kelly are making love on. The fight is often interrupted when Chris's testicles come swinging by.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Chris and Kelly play bigger parts in the second game.

====Origins====
At many points in the game, the New Kid will have to meet up with [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], who will allow them to choose an additional superhero class and then revise their "origin story." Regardless of how the backstory is altered, the New Kid will always find that Chris has "fucked" Kelly. The Coon fails to understand this is a common thing that happens to all people and considers this the New Kid's "tragic" backstory.

====Homeward Bound====
Each day ends with the New Kid coming home to find their parents arguing with each other. Chris berates Kelly for giving information to [[Mr. Mackey|the School Councillor]] and [[PC Principal|the School Principal]] about the New Kid's gender and race after the talks. Chris is angry because he wants to keep the New Kid's real backstory secret. They attempt to hide their fighting when they notice their child is watching, and go into the bedroom to fight.

====[[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]]====
When traveling through Mephesto's lab, the New Kid finds a room, where both Chris and Kelly are locked up. To proceed to the next room, the New Kid needs DNA from one of their parents. This involves either cutting off Chris's head or tearing off Kelly's arm, either of which will result in the victim dying. The New Kid then puts the head/arm in the scanner and can continue.

====Explanation====
In "[[Farts of Future Past]]", the New Kid inadvertently farts themself back in time to their origin story. They enter their parents' bedroom, where, after seeing 2 versions of his child, Chris reveals the New Kid's true backstory. He explains that, when he was younger, he created a [[Facebook]] page, and managed to make over 2 million friends in under 3 hours. Scientists kidnapped him and Kelly, running experiments to discover the source of their powers. The two then fell in love and conceived the New Kid. They had to run away, moving from town to town, until they got to South Park. After telling the New Kids and the Coon this, they feel better and decide to live happily.

During the explanation, his Facebook profile shows his relationship status as "married [https://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/File:Cris_Facebook_pre_Experiments.png]", showing he was married before he met Kelly.

==Appearance==
The skin color and hair color of Chris depends on the skin and hair color of the new kid. Chris wears a white shirt and grey trousers with a black belt.

==Personality==
Chris seems to be the more strict of the two parents. He kicks the New Kid out of the house at the start of Stick of Truth. He is also the one who criticizes the New Kid and grounds them when they are not home on time.

However, he had an extreme change of heart in The Fractured But Whole, he no longer encourages the New Kid to socialize, but instead tries to prevent them from catching much attention. He also seems to be more intolerant towards the New Kid's farts, even expressing hatred for the child themself for it in his dreams.

==Relationships==
===[[The New Kid]]===
Chris is a concerned father to the New Kid, but often is the one to tell the New Kid off. He seems to get irritated by the New Kid's silent nature, hardly ever speaking in the games. Chris is protective over his child, worried that people will find out about their background and eventually lock them up again.

===[[Kelly (Mom)|Kelly]]===
The two's relationship was not majorly featured, but it's still demonstrated as loving each other. They also had a long sex scene throughout the quest "[[Defeat the Underpants Gnomes]]", further proving their love for one another.

In The Fractured But Whole, Kelly and Chris are seen fighting each other. When Mr. Mackey speaks to Kelly for clarification about the New Kid's gender identity, Chris berates her, worried people will find out the truth. This then continues until they argue all the time, not caring whether the New Kid sees or not. Even in [[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]], when the New Kid has to make a decision of who to kill, the two yell at each other from across the room and each tries to persuade the New Kid to kill the other. In the later plot where they were visited by the New Kid from the future, they tell their child the truth, the two feel better and make up with each other. And as a result, they make out with each other in the post-credit scene.
