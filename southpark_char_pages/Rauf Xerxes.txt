'''Rauf Xerxes''' is the owner of [[Club Persh]] in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She tried to shut down the [[Les Bos]] bar but was stopped by [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]. She appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[D-Yikes!]]".

==Appearance==
Xerxes wears a nearly half-unbuttoned, spotted white shirt, and blue jeans. She also wears several items of jewelry. Her right ear, nose, and right eyebrow are pierced. She also has been seen wearing a Bluetooth headset on her left ear. Despite attempting to masquerade as a man, she seems to have very "worked on" eyebrows.

==Personality==
Xerxes has a compromise-type personality, originally willing to reason with the girls who were preventing them from taking over [[Les Bos]]. She also seems to have a lust for power, even going as far as masquerading as a man so she could become the leader of South Park's Persian club.

==Relationships==
===[[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]===
In "[[D-Yikes!]]", she is seen scissoring with Mrs. Garrison, with this, we can presume that they may have had a short relationship (Although, it could've just been a one-night stand). Mrs. Garrison has since "changed back" into a man, and since Xerxes is a lesbian, we can assume that their relationship is over.

==Trivia==
*Her name, as well as her appearance, is a parody of how the movie ''[[wikipedia:300 (film)|300]]'' portrayed the legendary Persian king, Xerxes.
*In reality, [[wikipedia:Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] was a male king, who ruled Persia from 485 to 465 BC.
*Despite being female, her voice is extremely deep.

==Prominence==
*"[[D-Yikes!]]"
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the [[COVID-19|pandemic]].
