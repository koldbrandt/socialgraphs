'''Jared Scott Fogle''' appears in the [[Season Six]] episode "[[Jared Has Aides]]", in which he encourages the people of ''[[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'' to lose weight. He claimed that this was the result of a diet where he only ate Subway sandwiches but later admitted that he actually had help from his assistants, who he referred to as his 'aides'.

==Background==
He later appeared in "[[200]]" as one of the celebrities suing the town. He and [[Phil Collins]] were sent by [[Tom Cruise]] to pick up [[Muhammad]], but they are killed when their limo is blown up by [[Ginger Separatist Movement|Ginger Kids]].

Jared made a cameo appearance in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Stunning and Brave]]". He was seen trying to catch [[Syrian refugee children]] at the [[PC Delta]] fraternity house, satirizing the controversy over his outing as a child sex offender, and losing his sponsorship at Subway.

==Appearance==
Jared wears a blue, striped shirt, brown pants, and a brown belt with a golden colored belt buckle. He has brown hair and thick, brown eyebrows, and wears glasses.

Later in "[[Stunning and Brave]]", his appearance basically stays the same, but now with an aggressive and predatory smile on his face, and always holding out his hands, ready to catch his "prey". This appearance is added to The Fractured But Whole, where he also has Subway footlong sandwiches in his hands.

He also appears as a boss in Fractured But Whole.

==Personality==
Whilst he was initially portrayed as a well-intentioned and honest individual, he is in reality an evil and predatory [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] who enjoys vulnerable chasing down Syrian refugee children, with the intention of molesting them, showing him to have no qualms about harming young children.

==Trivia==
*Jared is killed in "[[200]]", yet he appears alive and well in "[[Stunning and Brave]]", with a new design. It is possible that [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] intended to keep him dead until he was discovered to be a pedophile in 2015.
