The '''Crab People''' are a group of sentient crab-like creatures that appear in the [[Season Seven]] episode "[[South Park is Gay!]]". They ran a show called ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' disguised as homosexual men. They are often heard chanting ''"Crab people, Crab people. Taste like crab, talk like people."''

==Background==
In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", their plans of taking over the world, by making everyone metrosexual, are revealed to [[Kyle Broflovski]]. Their goal was to make all the men weak, so an invasion would be easy, due to them being small and weak themselves. If they are unable to force people to be metrosexual, they dress them up in typical Crab People garb, claiming that this makes them one of them. The TV producers said they did it before on the ''Jeffersons''.

In "[[Quest for Ratings]]", [[Eric Cartman]] suggested Crab People while brainstorming ideas for a news show.

They were also mentioned at the end of "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", where they were blamed for destroying the [[Beaverton]] dam.

In "[[Basic Cable]]", they made a brief appearance with their own show during the random streaming series scene.

==Appearance==
Crab People are anthropomorphic crabs, vaguely resembling anthropomorphized coconut crabs in appearance. They vary in color and have biological crab features, such as antennae, claws, and crab shells. In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", they take on human disguises, disguising themselves as the cast of '''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy''', which they do with using highly realistic skin and bodysuits

==Personality==
The Crab people are evil creatures whose intention is world domination, which they seek through the manipulation and corruption of mankind. They are also a highly intelligent and advanced species, being able to cunningly trick humans into believing their various schemes and fads, allowing them to destroy societies. They are also rather elaborate and extravagant in nature, often enjoying ritualistic chanting and taking great pleasure and enjoyment in the sly art of impersonating humans and their behaviors.

===''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''===
Crab People appear as villains on several levels. They are most easily defeated with the Firey-Works tower, making them rather weak and easy to defeat, but they make up for this in numbers and speed, often moving to the end of the level quickly.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Their lair can be found through the sewers. Chanting is heard throughout the cavern. During the beta, Crab People were originally meant to have their own boss fight but were scrapped for unknown reasons.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Crab people are first encountered during the quest [[(You Can) Call on Me]], where [[the New Kid]] and [[Call Girl]] discover that they have taken over the [[D-Mobile]] store. They attempt to pass themselves off as normal human employees, but Call Girl quickly sees through their charade and engages them in combat, eventually killing the manager, King Crab, forcing the remaining crab people to flee the store. After their defeat, they reappear fighting alongside the other enemies the New Kid has made throughout the game ambushing the New Kid during the quest [[To Catch a Coon]] as they leave [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse|Tweek Bros. Coffee]]. They can later be found and fought near [[Stark's Pond]] and [[South Park Church]]. In ''[[Bring the Crunch]]'' DLC, [[The New Kid]] will encounter him by any chance during a fishing minigame at [[Lake Tardicaca]].
