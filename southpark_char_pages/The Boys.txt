'''The Boys''', also known as the '''Broship''', are a group consisting of the four main characters [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Kenny McCormick]], and [[Eric Cartman]]. Earlier episodes usually opened with an establishing shot of the boys standing at the [[Bus Stop]]. They were also referred to as "Children" by [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]].

After [[Kenny Dies|Kenny's death]], Stan, Kyle, and Cartman first replaced him with [[Butters Stotch]] for the first five episodes of [[Season Six]]. In "[[Professor Chaos]]", the boys hold a contest spoofing ''The Bachelor'', and settle on replacing him with [[Tweek Tweak]] until "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]". Kenny permanently reappears in "[[Red Sleigh Down]]". Other students in the 4th Grade (or the 3rd Grade, in the first three seasons) are usually included as part of the extended gang.

Cartman, Stan, and Kyle agreed to disband the group in "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" after [[COVID-19]] had led to straining relationships with each other, with the only established connections being who gets to keep [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] using the 2-2-3 system. They kept this information secret from Kenny - until the end of the episode, when Kenny finds out about Cartman's wishes for the group to disband when he reveals his [[Cartman's New Bros|"new" clique]]. Cartman's new friends invite him to [[Casa Bonita]] over the weekend, but he storms off in frustration when he realizes that it is the weekend where Cartman is with Kenny, with the latter being left totally confused. 

As Kenny had no consent in the matter, whether the disbandment is upheld in the future remains to be seen.

He has black hair. For a time between  [[Season Twenty-Two]] and [[Season Twenty-Three]], he wore a brown T-shirt made of 100% hemp to promote his father [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]â€™s marijuana business, [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]].

==Personalities==
===Stan Marsh===
{{main|Stan Marsh#Personality{{!}}Stan Marsh}}

Stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys. Stan has shown various positive traits; heroism, empathy, altruism, and various other positive traits. He is usually the one who is unaffected by the many scams, cults, and mass influences that South Park has been subjected to, and has a knack for seeing through falsely glorified practices and celebrities. Stan has been shown to have an overwhelmingly clear understanding of scams and corporate corruption than anyone else in South Park and has an especially good grasp of the dangers of cults. It is notable that he has a tendency to ridicule, make enemies out of, and/or bring shame to a very large number of celebrities that are shown in a poor light within the show.

===Kyle Broflovski===
{{main|Kyle Broflovski#Personality{{!}}Kyle Broflovski}}

Originally, Kyle's personality was extremely similar to Stan's - he had firm morals and generally was the "good boy" of the group, often being the one to deliver the "I learned something today" speech at the end of the episodes. After the abandoned plan to kill Kyle off in [[Season Five]] (that honor went, predictably, to Kenny) his personality was changed - most notably, his temper shortened considerably. Kyle has extremely strong beliefs, and when forced to question them, he becomes very upset and has somewhat of a short temper, (especially when it comes to Cartman. This has caused a lot of fights between the two boys). For the most part, Kyle bases his decisions on both his emotions and beliefs; therefore, he is easily coaxed into fights and manipulated by his feelings. Kyle also gets mad at Cartman's excessive anti-semitic statements.

===Kenny McCormick===
{{main|Kenny McCormick#Personality{{!}}Kenny McCormick}}

Kenny is the most sexually knowledgeable and experienced in the group. In earlier episodes, when an unknown term is introduced to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman, Kenny will be called upon by his friends to clarify, although Kenny sometimes does not know the meaning of the term himself. His muffled responses are often met with laughter or further confusion. Most of the time, the boys understand Kenny perfectly. He has also shown positive traits such as loyalty and heroism. Many of his deaths were sacrifices for his friends and even the whole world.

===Eric Cartman===
{{main|Eric Cartman#Personality{{!}}Eric Cartman}}

Cartman is described in various terms; in short, he is an evil, vicious, angry, selfish, greedy, spoiled, and insane child. He is the most foul-mouthed character in the show. He is also racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees. The very dark, usually disturbing undertones to his personality often hint at an extreme mental imbalance. Apart from being portrayed as having a general lack of moral responsibility or social conscience, he also seems to take pleasure from others' misfortune and is generally unable to show empathy. Cartman enjoys delivering hate speech, especially to people of the Jewish religion. He speaks in a breathy Southern accent.

===Butters Stotch===
{{main|Butters Stotch}}
Butters is seen frequently seen with The Boys and ever since Kenny's temporary death in [[Season Six]], he has become more and more popular. Over time, his role in the show has grown and has become a fan favorite.

==Trivia==
*The boys have the four main hair colors: black ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]]), red ([[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]), blonde ([[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]), and brown ([[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]). Even when [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] or [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] replace Kenny, this remains the case.
*Each boy and their respective father is voiced by the same person.
*2 of the boys' names both start with the same letter. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] both start with 'K'.
*The Boys have Afghan counterparts known as [[The Afghan Boys]].
*According to the commentary for "[[Professor Chaos]]", they planned on changing the fourth friend every run, but after Tweek, they ultimately decided to bring back Kenny.
*Although there seems to be an ongoing rivalry between the Boys and [[Craig's Gang]] (as seen in the episodes "[[South Park is Gay!]]", "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", and "[[Quest for Ratings]]"), the two groups often put aside their differences and coalesce into one group to pursue a greater cause ("[[Free Willzyx]]", "[[Marjorine]]", and "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", among others). In later seasons, Jimmy, Token, Clyde, and Craig are frequently seen hanging out with the Boys and Butters.
*[[Season Seventeen]] marks the first season in which The Boys were never seen functioning as a quartet. Every episode generally focused on 1 or 2 of the boys, the kids as a whole, or supporting characters.
**On another note, [[Season Twenty]] is the first season where the boys are never shown together as a whole.
*All of the boys' homes are different shades of green.
