The '''Harry Potter Kids''' are a group of students roleplaying as characters from the ''Harry Potter'' universe. They appear in the [[Season Six]] episode "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]".

==Background==
As [[the boys]] were playing ''Lord of the Rings'', they were tasked to return [[Back Door Sluts 9|a pornographic tape]] to the [[Two Towers Video Store|video store]]. Along the way, they encounter a group of kids playing ''Harry Potter'' and casting spells on one another, with [[Eric Cartman]] taunting them for being "fags".

As the boys were being chased by the [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]], Cartman suggested to cross a nearby river as he claims that "6th graders can't stand water". [[Craig Tucker]] opposed to this and decided to join the Harry Potter kids instead.

==Appearance==
