'''[[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s Sister''' is mentioned in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]".

==Background==
She is mentioned by her mother, [[Betsy Donovan]], who was trapped in the toilet due to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] leaving the seat up. Betsy tells Clyde to always lower the toilet seat for his sister's sake. During Betsy's funeral, where several relatives of Clyde are shown, a young woman can be seen sitting on the right side of Clyde and his [[Roger Donovan|father]]. It is possible that this is Clyde's sister. In a deleted scene from the episode, a girl is seen singing at Betsy's funeral; it is also possible that this could be Clyde's sister.

==Appearance==
Clyde's first possible sister has curly brown hair, brown eyebrows, and red lipstick. She was spotted wearing a long-sleeved black shirt and gray skirt at the funeral. His second possible sister has short brown hair and brown eyebrows. She wears a pink shirt, a black skirt, black shoes, and glasses.
