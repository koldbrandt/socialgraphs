'''Saddam Hussein''' was the former president and dictator of [[Iraq]] between July 1979 and April 2003. He first appeared in ''[[South Park]]'' in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]". Shortly before the [[American-Canadian War]], he was killed by a pack of wild boars and became [[Satan]]'s jealous, emotionally abusive, and manipulative ex-boyfriend. He was a recurring character in ''South Park'', and the main antagonist of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

==Background==
Hussein first made a very brief cameo in "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]", in an image shown by some Iraqis to the third grade class as evidence of [[Ms. Ellen]] being Hussein's mistress. He does not have the Canadian look in the photograph nor does he have a real life photo of his face. Her connection to him is a significant plot point that results in Ms. Ellen's ultimate death.

Hussein first appeared in "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", in which he kidnapped [[Celine Dion]] and tried to take over [[Canada]]. He launched an assault on Canada, sneaking his troops through the air lines, with the Canadians not noticing the large numbers of Saddam's troops moving in. By the end of the episode, he managed to take over most of Canada, although he was killed when all the Canadians farted, and later becomes a very visible resident of [[Hell]].

In "[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]", Hussein is briefly seen with Satan welcoming [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' television producer to Hell. This is where it is first hinted he has a relationship with Satan, as he is seen holding hands with him.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he is the secondary, later true main antagonist. Hussein continues his romantic relationship with Satan as he plans to conquer the world by taking advantage of Satan's power as ruler. Also, in the film, it was stated at the start that he got killed by a pack of wild boars six weeks earlier. That was an error because boars never killed him in the show, as he died in "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" due to a "mass fart". He uses his position of power over Satan to launch an invasion of earth after the American-Canadian war made it possible for him to enter, and his demons briefly manage to take over the world. US soldiers tried to shoot him, but he was shown to be immune to their weaponry. He is defeated after Cartman hits him with several powerful electrical shocks from his rewired V-chip (Cartman generates the electricity by swearing), and when Satan, tired of his abuse, throws the weakened Saddam off a cliff and back into Hell, where he lands on a large stalagmite and is impaled. He is later seen briefly singing [[Mountain Town (Reprise)]] while still impaled on the stalagmite.

In "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]", Saddam returns to Hell, having nowhere else to go after his death, and tries to move in with Satan. He constantly murders Satan's new boyfriend, [[Chris]], however he keeps coming back since they are already in hell.

In "[[Probably]]", Satan deals with his decision to choose his current boyfriend over Saddam. He ends up choosing neither, and as punishment for Saddam's abusive, manipulative actions, banishes him to heaven to live with Mormons. He finds their kindness unbearable.

Hussein also appears briefly in "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]" when he is suspected by the US government of building a chemical weapons plant in [[Heaven]]. Being the manipulative character that he embodies in ''South Park'', he even convinces [[God]] that he could not possibly be building chemical weapons in Heaven, despite the fact that he himself admits his cover up for the plant, a chocolate chip factory, is easily see-through.

In "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", pictures of Saddam are seen on some buildings when [[Santa Claus]] is flying around Iraq.

He is also one of the forms the alien [[Najix]] takes in "[[Cancelled]]".

He also appeared in "[[Krazy Kripples]]", in which [[Christopher Reeve]] called the attention of all the bad guys in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], including Hussein, [[David Blaine]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], his sidekick [[General Disarray]] and others. He recommends "killing all the infidels" as opposed to getting rid of [[Gene Hackman]]. Although it is unknown how he returned to Earth from Heaven, God may have discovered his cookie factory was a cover for weapons of mass destruction exiled him to Earth.

In "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", Hussein appears as the man in a shallow alcove behind a curtain controlling the Prime Minister of Canada, in a dual reference to the Great Oz of ''The Wizard of Oz'' and his real life hiding from the US infantry in a pit under a tent. He makes many new, unnecessarily hateful and eccentric laws, including one that forced Ike to leave the US and move to Canada. The boys travel to Canada to get Ike back, coming across several other people who were affected by Saddam's laws. When they finally reach Saddam, he kills Kenny with lasers, and refuses to give Ike back to his brother. When Kyle asks "What the hell is wrong with you? What kind of Prime Minister bases all his decisions on hatred?" he is unveiled as the Prime Minister of Canada, and is promptly arrested by Canadian soldiers. He is last seen being paraded through a city on a float, with the Canadians celebrating his capture similar to how Iraqi's spontaneously took to the streets after his real life capture.

If you look very carefully in "[[A Million Little Fibers]]" when it shows the reporter from the Middle East, you can see a portrait of Hussein in the background.

==Appearance==
Saddam Hussein appears as any other Canadian character except his head is a cut out of the real person. He has a floppy head, a high-pitched voice and wears dark gray pants, a dark brown military jacket, and black shoes.

In the episode "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", his face is picture of him, with damaged skin and messy hair and beard, after he was dragged from a hidey-hole some days before the episode aired.

==Personality==
Saddam Hussein on ''South Park'' has mannerisms that differ from the real Saddam. Firstly, he speaks English only, secondly, he talks in a whiny, high pitched voice, and thirdly, he is homosexual. He also is shown to be very manipulative, often accomplishing his tasks fairly easily due to the stupidity of nearly everyone around him, even God and Satan at times.

He often creates diabolical schemes to take over the world. Most prominently in the film, where he manipulated his boyfriend Satan into invading earth, just so Saddam could push him aside and assume control of the world himself. He also organizes a gambit to invade Canada, sneaking his soldiers through the airlines in "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]" and apparently built a chemical weapons plant to take over the world in "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]".

His most recent plot was to become the Prime Minister of Canada by tricking the Canadians. He becomes the Prime Minister for a short time, but is defeated when the boys find out who he really is, and Canadian soldiers arrest him.

Saddam appears to be very sadistic, as evidenced by his torture of Kenny in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he is heavily implied to have a sexual fetish for it. Similarly, Saddam appears to be very sex-crazed. He satisfies both his lust for power and his sex cravings by being in a homosexual relationship with Satan, whom he is very abusive towards.

As shown in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" and "[[Probably]]" his first instinct when his relationship with Satan is threatened when Satan finds a new, much kinder [[Chris|boyfriend]] is to murder said boyfriend, and his first reaction after Satan breaks up with him is to constantly stalk him.

He is a self-proclaimed psychopath, as evidenced in his song "[[I Can Change]]", which contained the following lyrics:
''"I like to kill I like to maim but its OK because I can change!"'', during which he kills a dancer by breaking her back. He also apparently had abusive parents, as evidenced by other lyrics from the same song:

''"Its not my fault, that I'm, so evil its society. society. You see my parents were sometimes abusive, and it made a prick of me."'' During these lyrics caricatures of Saddam's parents are seen physically abusing their infant son.

Saddam also is depicted as very power hungry, greedy, and dishonest. On one occasion, he is shown to be a religious extremist, as evidenced by his line in "[[Krazy Kripples]]", where he recommends "Death to the infidels" as opposed to getting rid of [[Gene Hackman]].

==Quotes==
*"Heeeeeeyyyyy! Relax, guy!"
*"Where was I gonna go, Detroit?"

U.S. Government Representative: Mr. Hussein, the U.S. government is becoming worried.

Saddam: Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off! Relax!

Representative: You seem to be taking over Canada.

Saddam: Taking over Canada? Me? Hey, you need a rest, fella! I'm not hiding any bombs!

Representative: We didn't say anything about bombs.

Saddam: Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax!

==Trivia==
*It is rumored by some U.S. Soldiers that the real Saddam Hussein was shown the film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' while on trial for genocide/crimes against humanity as a form of torture.
*He is voiced by Matt Stone but in the end credits it says he was voiced by himself.
*Saddam was the second celebrity whose head was used on the body of an animated South Park character, right after David Hasselhoff.
*In the episode "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", he pronounces about as "aboot". This, combined with his Canadian style head and his habit of saying "relax guy/friend" when people suspect him, implies that he is Canadian in some way. However, in other episodes, he pronounces about as "about", and does not have a Canadian accent.
*The cause for Saddam's death changes every time it is mentioned in the series - the film states he was killed by a pack wild boars while in "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]" and George Bush claims U.S. assassins took him out. He also was claimed to have died from a chemical gas attack by the Canadians in "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]". However, this episode is shown as a fictional show-within-a-show in the episodes "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]" and "[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]".
*Saddam was described by Satan once as "fucking crazy." Considering this ''is'' Satan, this is fairly ironic, although Satan has been shown as considerably nicer and more sensitive than he is depicted in other media.
*When Saddam Hussein first appeared on South Park, he was still the dictator of Iraq, making his appearance as Satan's boyfriend rather surreal, especially the first time they aired.
*Although Saddam is South Park's biggest and most dangerous villain and a real person and celebrity, he does not appear in "[[200]]" or "[[201]]".
*Saddam is referenced a few times as the Iraqi Dictator instead of Satan's boyfriend:
**In "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", an image of Hussein is seen in the room where [[Santa Claus]] is being tortured by the Iraqis.
**The pro-war guy sings a song about America's need to fight Saddam Hussein in "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]".
**In "[[Erection Day]]", [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] tells a joke about how Saddam fell, but the price of gas did not.
*In the commentary track for ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'''s Blu-ray release, [[Trey Parker]] mentions that they had an idea to bring back Saddam in [[Season Thirteen]], however, this never came to fruition.
*Saddam initially started out as the film's secondary antagonist and Satan's henchman.  However, this is no longer true, because Satan has reformed later on, leaving Saddam to usurp him and become the true main villain in the long run.
*Saddam was found in a pit beneath a tent hovel on December 13, 2003 in the town of ad-Dawr, Iraq, near Tikrit as the conclusion of the US military Operation "Red Dawn".  His face in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]" is from the images circulating in the news and added to the final cut 4 days before airtime. The plot elements of him hiding behind a curtain and people parading after his capture are from real life.<ref>http://innatheday.blogspot.com/2011/12/december-132003-former-iraqi-president.html</ref><ref>http://storiesofourboys.com/2018/02/25/saddam-hole-december-2003/</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3317637.stm</ref>
*Saddam Hussein died in real life about a month after "[[Stanley's Cup]]" aired, meaning that "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]" could be Saddam's last appearance.
