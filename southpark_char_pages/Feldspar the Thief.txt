'''Feldspar''' is a noble thief in the land of Zaron. He first served as a lieutenant in the PlayStation 4 Army under Ranger Stan Marshwalker and [[Princess Kenny]]. He is the alter-ego of [[Craig Tucker]]. He appears throughout [[Season Seventeen]]'s Black Friday trilogy, in "[[Black Friday]]", "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]", and "[[Titties and Dragons]]".

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
In the game, Feldspar is a member of the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]] as one of the [[Grand Wizard King]]'s three bravest warriors (the others being [[Tweek Tweak]] the Barbarian and [[Token Black]] the Healer), serving as an elite thief. He is broken out of detention by [[The New Kid|Douchebag]], and from that point assists Kupa Keep in the battle of the Giggling Donkey. However, Feldspar ends up betraying Kupa Keep and joined [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde Donovan's]] [[Clyde's Army of Darkness|Army of Darkness]] as his lieutenant, on the grounds that Cartman had no authority following Clyde's theft of the [[Stick of Truth]]. He attempts to defend Clyde's base from an attack arranged by the alliance of the Grand Wizard and The High Elf but is defeated by Douchebag. He is not seen afterward.
