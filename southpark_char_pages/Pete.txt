}}{{LinkDisambig|Pete (Disambiguation)}}
'''Pete Thelman''' is a 4th-grader who first appears in "[[Raisins]]". He is one of the four main members of the [[Goth Kids]] along with [[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]], [[Michael]], and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]]. He is not be confused with the [[Pete Thelman|backround character]] who apparently has the same name. 

==Background==
Pete first appears in "[[Raisins]]" when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] tries to join their group after being dumped by [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]]. Up until [[Season Seventeen]]'s "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", Pete was referred to only as "Hair Flip".

In "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", he appears as one of the main characters with [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]] to save [[Michael]] and Henrietta from becoming emos. They recruit the [[South Park Vampire Society|Vamp Kids]] to get some help and summoned [[Edgar Allan Poe]], Poe instead leaves them and tries to call for him in Poe's coffee in the reflection. 

===Criminal Record===
Pete has engaged in numerous criminal offenses, mainly along with the other Goth Kids.
*'''Arson:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", he, along with the other Goth Kids, sets fire to the South Park [[Hot Topic]] store, burning it to the ground.
*'''Attempted Murder/Kidnapping:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", he, with the Goth Kids, kidnap [[Mike Makowski]] with the intent of murdering him.
*'''Drug Abuse/Underage Smoking: '''The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their ages (5 to 10), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Grand Theft Auto/Driving Without a License:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", the Goth Kids steal Henrietta's mother's car without her permission, even though they are too young to have a license. In "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", Pete drives a car perfectly, it is unknown how did he got the car himself.
*'''Treason/Sedition:''' In the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superhero Saga]], the Goth Kids are shown to be part of the Cthulhu cult and supporting [[Cthulhu]]'s reign of terror.

===Talents===
====Music====
He plays the bass guitar in the Goth Kids' band. Their only known song was "[[Talent Shows are for Fags]]" played ironically at the elementary school talent show in the episode "Erection Day". 
====Magic====
Pete is shown to have some magical abilities, as he talks with the ghost of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] through the reflection of his coffee in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]".
====Driving====
In "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", he is shown knowing how to drive a car, despite being 10 years old. 

==Appearance==
He wears an untucked dark-gray dress shirt, black pants, purple buckled winklepickers, and a silver bolo tie with a red jewel in the center. He has black teased hair that is parted on the right and shaved around the bottom half and is dyed red near the roots on top. He also has a long fringe, which he is constantly seen flipping out of the way when it gets on his eyes. Apparently, this long fringe of hair has caused him acne problems, resulting in apparent pockmarks as mentioned by a student in "[[The Ungroundable]]". He even wears eyeliner.

From a single scene in "[[The Ungroundable]]", he wore a light-blue and dark-blue trimmed shirt with a red sailboat in the center, gray pants, and black shoes.

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', he wore earmuffs with brown fur and a dark-brown fur cape on his outfit.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', an adult version of him makes a cameo, showing him visably aged and wearing a grey shirt with a black sweater. His hair is also notably disheveled and reddish-brown, suggesting either his natural hair is brown, or he dyed it similar to Henrietta dying her hair blue.

==Personality==
He seems to be one of the most sympathetic of the goth kids, and in "[[Mysterion Rises]]" he is a little worried about the situation he and the other goth kids are in when they are trying to kill [[Mysterion]]. Though he did not want to kill anyone, he ended up walking with the rest of the goths because Michael said, "''killing is expected when you're a servant of Cthulhu.''" He cared about his friends too, and in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]" he and [[Michael]] try to help [[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]] after she turns into emo, they even risked their lives to get her back to normal. At the end of the episode, Pete tells Henrietta that they burned down the emo factory's leadership to avoid the embarrassment of her admitting that she was not forced into the emo, but out of her own free will.
