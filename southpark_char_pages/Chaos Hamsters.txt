'''Chaos Hamsters''' are [[Butters Stotch]]'s pets and serve as [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]'s minions.
==Background==
While Butters was dressing up the hamsters, he received an anonymous note, telling him to meet at the [[South Park Docks]]. There, he finds the person who sent the note, [[Dougie O'Connell]], and released two hamsters, only for them to run away.

==Appearance==
The Chaos Hamsters are brown hamsters who have a tiny tin foil helmet and green cape attached to them.
==Prominence==
*"[[Professor Chaos]]"
*"[[The Coon]]" - Professor Chaos keeps a hamster in his base at [[U-STOR-IT]].
*"[[Oh, Jeez]]" - Seen in Butters' bedroom.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Two Chaos Hamsters are kept in Butters' room. If the player has Butters as their active combat buddy while approaching the cage, Butters will explain, "Those are my minions. They help me punish society."

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
In [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]] mission, Professor Chaos released multiple Chaos Hamsters to try take down the [[Coon and Friends]]. The hamsters instead scattered away, not doing anything to the superheroes.

During [[The Chaos Gambit]] mission, [[The New Kid]] and Professor Chaos were grounded by [[Stephen Stotch]]. The New Kid then takes a hamster and a few other components, crafting it into a "Flying Minion" to help them escape Butters' room. This unlocks the Haywire Buddy Power, where Professor Chaos sticks a hamster onto the New Kid's butthole.
