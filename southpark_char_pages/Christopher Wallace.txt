{{LinkDisambig|Christopher (Disambiguation)}}
'''Christopher Wallace''', also known by his stage name, '''The Notorious B.I.G.''', or '''Biggie Smalls''', was a rapper who appeared in the episode "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", as a resident of [[Hell]]. As shown numerous times by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], he can be summoned by looking into a mirror and repeating his stage name three times in a similar manner to the Bloody Mary folklore.

==Background==
When [[Butters Stotch]] summoned Biggie out of curiosity, he was infuriated because he could not attend [[Satan]]'s Halloween party in [[Los Angeles]]. Furthermore, it is stated by Biggie that he had to deal with his summoning on every Halloween much to his discontent. As a result, he forced Butters to take him to the party at gunpoint. While on a plane to Satan's party with Butters, however, he was delayed to the party again when [[the boys]] summoned him. The boys take Biggie to the airport to resume his flight to the party but only to be suddenly summoned by [[Stan Marsh]]'s father [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]. He angrily chased Randy around his home until Butters (now outside the party) borrows a make-up mirror and summons him. At first, Biggie was irritated but got so thankful that Butters had summoned him there that he invites Butters to the party. Butters obliges Biggie's invitation, saying "oh, what the heck I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well."

==Appearance==
Christopher Wallace wore black pants, a white shirt, a brown vest, and a black coat. He has an elongated head with short black hair and can typically be seen wielding a pistol.

==Trivia==
*When he was summoned by Butters, it took about 2 seconds longer for him to be summoned to his room. This is most likely due to the fact that Butters was the first one to summon him.
*The summoning of Biggie is also a reference to the ''[[Wikipedia:Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' film and character.
