'''Craig Tucker''' is a member of [[The Boys|the boys]]' fourth grade class. Craig's most distinguishing physical feature is his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball. One of his traits is his compulsive tendency to flip people off, usually for no discernible reason. He leads the group known as [[Craig's Gang]] (aka Craig and those guys). He is one of the two children (along with Tweek Tweak) who are openly gay.

While eight years old in the first three seasons, he was nine years old by "[[Fourth Grade]]", and as of the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", he is ten years old, according to the candles on his birthday cake. He also speaks with a rather deep voice, which is unusual for a child at his age.

==Appearance==
Craig wears a blue jacket and a matching blue [[wikipedia:Chullo|chullo]] hat with a yellow puffball on top. He wore yellow mittens in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]". In the early seasons of the series, he wore blue jeans, but in more recent seasons, he wears high-waisted black pants. His legs are longer than those of the other children, a fact which is clearly visible in "[[South Park is Gay!]]", in which he and three other boys from his class wear identical clothes, because Craig's pants appear much longer than the others.

In "[[T.M.I.]]", he is listed to have grown the most in height out of all the boys, along with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], all three gaining 2.4 inches. This implies that he may be one of the tallest (if not the tallest) boys in the class, especially since he appeared to be taller than the others even before his growth. One of the reasons he may be tall is that both his parents are shown to be the tallest adults in the town.

In "[[The List]]" it's mentioned that to place Clyde 1st in the list, they had to move Craig to 12th place. Therefore, in the [http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:The_%27Real_List%27 real list], Craig was chosen as the "cutest boy" in class.

Craig's hair is usually shown to be black, although it appeared to be brown in "[[The Losing Edge]]" and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. In "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", Craig's eyes are shown to be blue. It is revealed in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]" that he is fairly thin. His nasal voice is similar to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] but was originally higher in pitch. However, in later seasons (most noticeable since "[[Pandemic]]"), his voice has been lowered to a similar pitch to Clyde.

A few times in the early seasons, he is seen wearing a green hat in the background. This has been corrected in later airings. An example that is still visible is in the episode "[[Fat Camp]]", in which he appears in the lunch line his hat turns green for a few seconds as the camera moves. A green-attired Craig can also be seen in "[[Ass Burgers]]", though some believe that this may be a different character entirely.

{{GallerySubPage|name=Craig Tucker}}

==Personality==
[[File:Craig.jpg|200px|thumb|Craig's image on the official site, portraying him giving the middle finger.]]
Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], having a more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his deeper-than-average voice. He has been described as pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers, typically being the one to call them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring very few but simple interests. In the making of [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], it was written on a whiteboard that he only cares about his [[Stripe|guinea pig]], and his boyfriend, [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]].

Craig is implied to have bad behavior, and is referred to as "the biggest trouble-maker" in his class by [[Eric Cartman]] in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]". Craig has a habit of flipping people off, sometimes to express irritation, anger, or disdain towards them, sometimes as a reflex. This is a trait the official ''South Park'' website states is learned from his family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/353176|title=FAQ - South Park Studios|publisher=southparkstudios.com}}</ref> who are all seen flipping each other off in "Tweek vs. Craig". His habit of flipping people off has been shown much less in later episodes, although a later incident regarding flipping off the principal of school ended up with him in detention, and it's part of one of his abilities in ''South Park: The Fractured But Whole''.

The last time in the main series where he is seen making the gesture is "[[Fun with Veal]]", where he and his parents are filmed by a cameraman, who gives them an interview. His parents are worried and talk about a serious event that occurs in town, as Craig just remains blank-faced and flips off the people who watch them on TV.

Due to his bad behavior, he is frequently sent to [[Mr. Mackey]]'s office. Scenes involving a character visiting [[Mr. Mackey]]'s office will often show Craig sitting in the waiting seats outside the door. Craig's most notable interview with [[Mr. Mackey]] was in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", where he flipped [[Mr. Mackey]] off several times and was sent to wait outside the office again.

In earlier episodes, Craig normally has a blank face - even when flipping people off. This is seen most predominantly in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]" when he randomly flips off his entire family while remaining a completely straight face. If his face isn't blank, he is frowning for one reason or another.

Although all the kids are violent, to an extent, Craig is shown to be the second most violent, after [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], due to the fact that he seems to be the primary initiator of several of the more severe incidents of bullying that occurred at the school (e.g. [[Mark Cotswolds]]' duct-taping).

Craig is also shown to be one of the most skilled fighters in the class, shown beating up [[Mark Cotswolds]], attacking Kyle when Kyle chooses not to dress like a metrosexual, attacking Kenny when Cartman frames him for having lice, and beating up several Ginger Kids after Cartman's speech. Contrarily, in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", he appears to have no idea how to fight at all and has to take lessons in sumo wrestling. He wields a katana in "[[Good Times with Weapons]]" as well. And in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", he manages to knock both Token and Butters unconscious before being knocked out by Stan, when he uses a bone as a club to strike him.

Later, his negative traits are subdued, as he is inclined to remain passive and stoical to everything that happens around him. An early expression of this is displayed in "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]", in which he approaches his classmates in the bathroom and asks what's going on. They tell him they're waiting for Cartman to defecate through his mouth. He only answers "Oh" and leaves immediately.

During the "[[Pandemic]]" episodes, he makes remarks about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny and their habit of getting into trouble - he even walks away from them when they want to go deeper into an Inca temple. However, at the end of the episode after he accidentally walks on the platform and stopped the "Guinea Pirate", he simply lets out a deep sigh and accepts his fate. Craig never once registers shock or any emotion whatsoever during this - he always says things flatly and monotonously, even when he says "Okay. Now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."

Craig has notable leadership skills, as he is the leader of a gang who is social rivals with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], Cartman, and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. The first appearance of the group is in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", and they are first acknowledged by the main characters in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]". The main characters are first shown viewing Craig's gang as rivals in "[[South Park is Gay!]]". Cartman frequently refers to the gang as [[Craig's Gang|"Craig and those guys"]]. The group usually consists of Craig, Clyde, Token, and sometimes Tweek, Jimmy, or Jason. Craig and Clyde seem to share/alternate in the leadership of their group, although, given their designation, Craig is the primary leader.

Another example of Craig's abilities in leadership occurs in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" when he leads the male students in their plan to harm [[Mark Cotswolds]]. The episode also shows that his assertiveness can also lead to bullying.

Craig competes more with the main characters than even the rest of his gang (see below). In "[[Quest for Ratings]]", he opens a television show in the school entitled "[[Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens]]", which rivals their news show. However, he seems quite eager to help them at other times, as in "[[Free Willzyx]]", in which he is one of the boys trying to get the orca back to its "home" on the moon. Nonetheless, he rarely hangs out with the boys by himself, he's only seen with them when the rest of Craig's gang is there.

In the episode "[[Pandemic]]", Stan and Kyle's parents decide that they do not want Craig to hang around with them since they had gone missing shortly after him joining the usual quartet. They deem him a "troublemaker", although the Peruvian flute band was actually the others' idea, and Craig refused to join them until he was told, "don't be an asshole."

In the episode "[[Quest for Ratings]]", Craig starts his own show and causes the main characters' news show to be canceled because he takes all their "ratings" (hence the title). By the end of the episode, Craig isn't just upset that "[[Sexy Action School News]]" got more ratings than his shows; the teacher also instructs that Craig's testicles be removed (although this was never shown or referenced again).

In the episode "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", it is shown that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] think that Craig is the biggest troublemaker and make a bet that Craig could easily beat Tweek Tweak. Both end up in the hospital. Despite trying to rest and give up fighting, both break out again when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] says to Tweek, "...then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."

Despite his past behavior, in recent episodes, he appears to have matured, possibly due to his relationship with Tweek.<ref>"[[Tweek x Craig]]"</ref> In "[[Put It Down]]", Craig is shown to be Tweek's voice of reason, using logic in an attempt to convince him that they wouldn't be attacked by North Korea, although he is unsuccessful. Craig is seen calmly assisting Tweek and tolerating his paranoia while keeping his usual monotone expression. After being inspired by Heidi, Craig takes a new approach to help Tweek and talks through his emotions with him. He also helps Kyle search for Ike after President Garrison nukes Canada in "[[Splatty Tomato]]".

Apart from his apathy, Craig has been shown to be a very rational thinker, such as when he tries to use logic to reason with Tweek's paranoia. In the game ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', Craig is seen getting increasingly more annoyed at Mephesto for his ridiculous and wasteful use of resources in trying to attach as many butts to things as possible as well as his absurdly illogical decisions and disregard for basic safety.

==Criminal Record==
*'''Assault:''' In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", Craig and Tweek are dared to fight each other by the boys. The duo inflicts many harmful physical attacks on one another, preceding their hospitalization. In "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", Craig knocks Butters and Token unconscious while engaging in a jealousy-filled with the rest of the boys. In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", he and the other boys bully and beat up Kyle at school just for not joining in on the metrosexual fad, to the point where he walked home visibly bleeding and having a black eye. In"[[Tweek x Craig]]", he got in a fight with Tweek again.
*'''False Imprisonment:''' In "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]", Craig and his gang torment [[Mark Cotswolds]] by taping him to a bench.
*'''Property Damage:''' In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Craig and the other boys destroy Cartman's electronics out of suspicion that he is the notorious internet troll [[Skankhunt42]].

==Family==
=== [[Grandma Tucker|Craig's Grandmother]] ===
Craig's grandmother, who appears in flashbacks in "Pandemic 2: The Startling", gave Craig $100 for his birthday. She is yet to have any speaking lines as she appears only in a still picture. She appears to be a very loving grandmother.

===Parents [[Thomas Tucker|Thomas]] and [[Laura Tucker|Laura]]===
In "[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]", as [[Token Black|Token]] is walking around South Park, looking sorrowfully at the others, he walks past the [[Wikipedia:Welfare|Welfare office]]. Craig and his parents are shown stepping out of the office at the same time. While Token may have been exaggerating in his thoughts about how poor everyone else in town is, this might imply that Craig's parents are jobless, or that their jobs don't provide enough income for them to get by on it alone.

It is hinted in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]" that he does not have a good relationship with his parents when Cartman says that he helped Craig get revenge on his parents for an unknown reason. He also states in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]" and "[[The Poor Kid]]" that he does not care if his mother is insulted. At the same time, his parents are shown to love him deeply, as they are each openly concerned when Craig is kidnapped in "[[Pandemic]]", and are delighted to have him back at the end of "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]". 

Not much is known of Craig's relationship with his mom but she is shown to be a caring mother. She scolded her husband when he responded to Craig's school fight with an apathetic "oh". She was shown to be neutral at the start of his relationship with Tweek in "[[Tweek x Craig]]" and in The Fractured But Whole encourages the player to get them back together.

The relationship between Craig and [[Thomas Tucker|his dad]] was explored briefly in "[[Tweek x Craig]]" where he originally was shown to have a slightly strained relationship with Thomas Tucker who was shown to be traditionally conservative and unhappy with rumors of his son being gay. Thomas later comes to accept Craig as he was and encourages his son to do what makes him happy and that he was proud of him. This was what led Craig to make the decision of rekindling his relationship with Tweek but this time for himself instead of for the town.

===[[Tricia Tucker]]===
The relationship between her and Craig is difficult to decipher. She shares the family behavior of flipping people off with her middle finger. She appears to be fond of Tweek, calling Craig a fuckboy and asking [[The New Kid]] to help get Tweek and her brother back together after they had a falling out. She has also stated that if Tweek and Craig ever had a kid she would be a cool aunt.

===[[Stripe]]===
Stripe is Craig’s pet guinea pig. His first on-screen appearance is in [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]. Craig has a very strong love for his guinea pig(s) and does not like it when Stripe is insulted. It was stated in a relationship chart done during the making of ''The Fractured But Whole'' that his guinea pig and Tweek are the only two things Craig cares about. Based on Craig's dialogue in ''The Fractured But Whole'', the current Stripe is Stripe #4, who was purchased by Tweek and they share ownership of. It is also known that Stripe #1 died after his mom accidentally stepped on it, breaking it's back and Stripe #3 might have been poisoned by [[Thomas Tucker|his dad]] after it pooped in the dining room.

==Interactions==
===[[Tweek Tweak]]===
[[File:304 laid-up.gif|thumb|Craig in the hospital after fighting [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]].]]
In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", [[The Boys|the main boys]], on account of a bet they had made, claim to Tweek and Craig that each had insulted the other, and convince them to fight. When it turns out neither of them knows how to fight, they have them trained for it. Craig is trained in Sumo wrestling by Cartman. After the fight, both boys are hospitalized, but the kids fool them into fighting again. It is possible, however, that this fight brought the two boys closer together, as they are seen together on very many occurrences in later episodes.  

In later seasons, Tweek and Craig can be seen standing side by side in various episodes including "[[Ginger Kids]]", where they are trapped in a cage together, and in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", where they are on the same side of the town. 

In the episode "[[Tweek x Craig]]", the new female Asian students draw Yaoi pictures of Tweek and Craig in love, despite the two not being together. To stop the drawings, the two-stage a "breakup" in front of the school to stop the pictures, but Tweek goes too far in his role and makes Craig out to be a cheater by inventing a "Michael" that Craig cheated on for dramatic effect. This crushes the town's spirits, so the two reconcile in order to appease the town. The two are now in a genuine relationship.    

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Put It Down]]", Tweek stresses over the nuclear bomb threats made by North Korea. Craig suggests that he make cupcakes for them, and this works until President Garrison insists that Tweek had pooped in the cupcake batter. Craig tries his best to make Tweek feel better. He gives him fidget spinners to fix his anxiety and gives him logical answers to his problem, which only makes things worse. But after hearing Heidi's speech about grieving, he comforts Tweek and talks with him about how he's feeling, helping him truly feel better.

Although their initial relationship appeared only to be in order to keep the town happy, following the events of "Tweek x Craig", the two have grown closer. In "[[Put It Down]]", Craig calls Tweek the affectionate pet names "babe" and "honey", even when no one is around, implying their relationship is now genuine. They are also often seen holding hands ("[[Put It Down]]", "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]", and "[[Splatty Tomato]]").

===[[Token Black]]===
Token has always been a member of [[Craig's Gang]] (even when Clyde isn't present) and the two are often seen next to each other. They do not have many onscreen interactions and have only been seen talking to each other in "[[Jewpacabra]]" and "[[Raising the Bar]]". It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Token and Clyde.

===[[Clyde Donovan]]===
[[File:Untitled-1 copy.jpg|thumb|Craig, and Clyde in "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]".]]
Clyde is a member of Craig's gang. Clyde sometimes leads the group, which suggests that he and Craig share the spot of the leader, but the position has been confirmed to be Craig's as the group is collectively named "Craig and those guys". The two are sometimes seen standing beside each other in the background, which indicates that the two may be best friends. It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Clyde.

[[File:Craig&Clyde.png|left|thumb|Craig and Clyde in the future device in "[[Marjorine]]".]] 
Clyde and Craig are seen together in a number of episodes, whether they are sitting next to each other or just talking to each other. In "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]", they are seen working together for Cartman to look for [[Slash]]. In "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", they play [[Texans vs. Mexicans]] on Cartman's side to prevent "Mexicans" from passing their border (which they, unfortunately, fail in doing). In [[Elementary School Musical]], they eat together in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]]. In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", they are cheer while watching Cartman and Wendy's fight.  In "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", Clyde hugs Craig when the rekindle their friendship. In "[[Lice Capades]]", Craig tells Clyde to bring a bar of soap and a sock to beat Kenny up. Because of this, many fans see them as best friends like Stan and Kyle.

Their names are sometimes mixed up, as shown in "[[Super Fun Time]]", and they have nearly identical nasally voices, which Cartman tells Craig in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth|The Stick of Truth]]'', but Craig disagrees with. Craig is usually the straight man to Clyde's funny man personality.

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
[[File:Screen shot 2010-09-11 at 11.45.11 AM.png|thumb|Stan, and Craig talking to a Mexican.]]
Stan and Craig are somewhat rivals in episodes "[[Pandemic]]", "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", as they are both fighting because Craig is upset that they took his $100. In the episode "[[South Park is Gay!]]", they both argue that Craig is gayer than [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. Stan and Craig generally do not hang out. Furthermore, Stan's parents and Kyle's parents agree on preventing their kids from associating with Craig because Craig is seen as a big troublemaker and having a bad influence on Stan and Kyle in "Pandemic". Despite the rough points, they seem to be on better terms later in the series as seen in "[[You're Getting Old]]", where Craig is attending Stan's birthday party and is seen smiling while there.

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
[[File:Pandemic012.png|thumb|Convincing Craig to join the boys' Peruvian flute band]]
Although Craig and Kyle do not really hang out with each other, they can often be seen sitting at the same table for lunch. The two have ended up on opposite sides of the field many times, though - they argue (with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny backing Kyle up) over the Peruvian pan flute band in "[[Pandemic]]" and "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]". In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", Craig leads the school in beating Kyle up for not being metrosexual, and in "[[Quest for Ratings]]", Craig's show is in direct competition with a show Kyle is involved in. In "[[Raising the Bar]]", Craig tells Token he should tell Kyle the truth about exploiting Cartman for TV. Kyle can be seen walking with Craig and Timmy in "[[Cartman Finds Love]]". In "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]" Kyle says that he thinks that Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler. In "[[Splatty Tomato]]", when Kyle says he is going to look for his missing brother, Craig himself volunteers to help Kyle, showing that he considers him enough of a friend to help in difficult times.

===[[Kenny McCormick]]===
[[File:Screen shot 2010-09-11 at 11.33.23 AM.png|thumb|Craig and Kenny holding hands in "[[Super Fun Time]]".]]
Craig and Kenny seem to have formed a sort of friendship. In "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]" Kenny says muffled: "I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt". Kenny helps Craig with his show in "[[Quest for Ratings]]" (although it was induced by Cartman saying that Kenny couldn't join the school news team due to his poverty), and the two are partners in "[[Super Fun Time]]". The two have also been seen sitting next to each other, for example in "[[The List]]", and standing near each other on several occasions, this may however just be a coincidence. They are not otherwise shown as being close friends. In the episode "[[Lice Capades]]", Craig accuses Kenny of having lice. In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", Kenny is heard saying, "''I fucking hate Craig!''" at the end (this could have been because of how Craig reacted to the situation in that episode and "[[Pandemic]]", or that Craig had just refused to fund another of their music bands).

===[[Eric Cartman]]===
Cartman appears to view Craig as a rival, trying to prove to him that his gang is cooler than his, like in "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", in which he is the one that proposes the idea of showing off his weapons to Craig. A similar thing happens in "[[South Park is Gay!]]", in which he wants to prove that he and his friends are gayer than Craig's gang.

Cartman has declared his hate for Craig more than once, but despite that, he says "I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool" in "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]".

Craig actually hates Cartman, but he has been seen with him as a right-hand man when Cartman assembles a group of boys for his cause, like in "[[Lice Capades]]" or "[[Marjorine]]". He is also on Cartman's side of town in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", and works for his business in "[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]", along with Clyde, Butters, and later Kyle.

Craig is often the main rival of Cartman and the other boys but has sometimes seemed to accept Stan, Kyle and Kenny in episodes such as "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", in which he declares that he also wants to ignore Cartman since he hates him. Furthermore, he is the only boy who doesn't apologize to Cartman after he saves the hostages in the Red Cross.

Also, in the episode "[[Tsst]]", Cartman confronts Craig and asks him if he can stay at his place for a while; Craig refuses and blatantly says, "''But I hate you''". This hatred isn't always against Cartman. In the episode "[[South Park is Gay!]]", Craig and his gang seem to be rivals with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman. Craig is aware of Cartman's assertive, selfish, and manipulative nature, as well as the fact that Cartman will always get what he wants in one way or another. This is shown in "[[Fishsticks]]", in which he argues with Jimmy that "You should consider yourself lucky that he (Cartman) is only asking for half." and tell him to "Just give him half." This is also shown in "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]", in which he tells Mr. Nelson that trying to teach Cartman a lesson is "not a good idea". 

Craig is shown to be close enough to Cartman to sleep over his house for a slumber party.

They are also seen both laughing at the idea of girl's volleyball in "[[Cock Magic]]".

Craig joins Kyle, Stan, Butters, Token, Jimmy, and Clyde to smash Cartman's electronics when they think that he is [[Skankhunt42]] in "[[Skank Hunt]]".

===[[Jimmy Valmer]]===
Jimmy has been Craig's friend on a few occasions and can be seen at times along with [[Craig's Gang]]. He has been seen hanging around Craig in the background for other episodes as well. In "[[Fishsticks]]", Craig claims that he likes Jimmy and tries to reason with him in order to help him out. In "[[Ginger Kids]]", Jimmy is seen along with Clyde, Token, and Craig bullying a ginger kid out of the school cafeteria. In "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", Jimmy rivals Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny as ninjas along with Craig, Clyde, and Token. Quite often, they are seen sitting near each other in the canteen.

===[[Timmy Burch]]===
[[File:Capture4.PNG|thumb|137x137px]]
Timmy can be seen sitting beside Craig on numerous occasions, most notably in class in "[[Dances with Smurfs]]", and at [[Whistlin' Willy's]] in "[[Margaritaville]]". In "Cartman Finds Love", Timmy can be seen talking and hanging out with Craig for a fair portion of the episode, suggesting a close friendship.

===[[Jason]]===
Jason has been in Craig's Gang on one occasion, but has not been seen with Craig since "[[South Park is Gay!]]".

===[[Thomas]]===
[[File:SPLPT5.jpg|thumb|right|Craig, and Thomas.]]
In "[[Le Petit Tourette]]", Craig meets Thomas at the end and asks if he can hang out with him and "do his laundry". However, it is unknown if the two are even friends as Thomas hasn't been seen since this episode and the two haven't been seen together on screen.

===[[Annie Knitts]]===
Craig and Annie can be seen walking together in a couple of episodes, like the episode "[[Poor and Stupid]]". At the beginning of the episode, they are walking together in the background when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is seen crying. The two can also be seen walking in the background of [[South Park Elementary]].

===[[Red McArthur]]===
Craig and Red are paired together in "[[Follow That Egg!]]" where the two appear to enjoy each other's company. They can be seen talking to each other and walking away together in "[[Funnybot]]" and are in the children's choir together in "[[The City Part of Town]]". Craig and Red can be seen together throughout "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]" and sit next to each other on the bus in "[[Basic Cable]]". They can also often be seen sitting next to each other in class.

===[[Butters Stotch]]===
Craig and Butters seemed to have been friends at one time in the earlier seasons. In "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]" they bully [[Mark Cotswolds]] together throughout the episode. In "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", they are at the gas station together when the couple arrives; Butters is the mechanic and Craig is playing spaceman. In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight [[Wendy Testaburger]]. However, later in the series, their friendship seems to have vanished; in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tetherball while the latter is tied to the tetherball pole. 

Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] was present at dinner in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", noting, "Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.", which is ironic considering the fact that Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character. However, a benevolent situation occurs in "[[Bass to Mouth]]", in which Butters is looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan. Furthermore, in "[[Going Native]]", Craig seemed alarmed when he learned of Butters' change in behavior by Cartman and followed the others outside the boys' bathroom and in "[[Obama Wins!]]" when Butters' caused an allergic reaction to himself, both of which are unusual for his indifferent personality. This may show he considers Butters' as something of a friend.

=== Unknown relationship ===
Craig probably had a girlfriend before and during [[South Park: The Stick of Truth|The Stick of Truth]]. However, the player will see that Craig posted on his Facebook, saying that he broke up. He also pointed out that thieves work alone and she was holding him back.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''===
Craig plays a small role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and appears at the end of the "Stark's Pond" level to inform the player the Sixth Graders' Lair, the stage for the next level, is where they should go next. The boys who told this, which Craig claims he doesn't know, with Cartman angrily noting he sounds like [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], before Craig leaves them, telling them to suck his balls. In gameplay, he is of the same "Sniper" class as [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Pip Pirrip]] and [[Professor Chaos]], moving slowly but dealing heavy damage and with a wide range. His special ability slows down all enemies for several seconds.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Craig appears in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' as a supporting character and later an antagonist.

Craig first appears as a member of Kupa Keep, but is in detention. The player has to break him out so he can help retrieve the Stick of Truth. Afterwards, Craig can be seen in various locations at Kupa Keep between missions. Craig joins the other members of Kupa Keep in their infiltration of the Inn of the Giggling Donkey. When the player is trapped in the basement, he comes to the rescue by helping to clear the elves and unlocks the door. He briefly becomes the vendor at the Kupa Keep shop, commenting that Cartman gave him the spot because he sounds like Clyde.

Later on, Craig betrays the other kids and joins Clyde because Cartman "doesn't have authority anymore". He becomes Clyde's second-in-command and, while fighting through Clyde's fortress, fights the player with the help of Nazi Zombie Cows. Once he is defeated, he does not reappear anymore during the game.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
His superhero persona [[Super Craig]] is a member of [[Coon and Friends]]. He and [[Wonder Tweek]] have a side plot together consisting of them having broken up due to Craig refusing to follow Tweek when the latter defected to the [[Freedom Pals]]. The missions focusing on said side plot are [[Ghost Reconciler]], in which Tweek demands custody of their guinea pig Stripe, much to Craig's annoyance, and [[Therapy Wars]], in which they go to a couple counseling session on the advice of [[Richard Tweak]], and eventually end up patching up their relationship and getting back together.

Aside from this side plot, Craig's main prominence is in the mission [[The Chains of Super Craig]], in which the player has to help him find Stripe to get him as a combat buddy, and during the mission [[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]], in which he gets more and more angry at Dr. Mephesto's unpractical decisions and bad safety protocols.

==Reception==
In his review on the ''South Park'' episode "[[Fishsticks]]", Sean O'Neal of the A.V. club refers to the character Craig as a "[[Wikipedia:Pragmatism (non-technical usage)|pragmatist]]", for advising [[Jimmy Valmer]] to let [[Eric Cartman]] have half the credit for the [[Fishsticks Joke]].<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/fishsticks,26396/ ''South Park'': Season 13, episode 5, "Fishsticks".] Sean O'Neal, A.V. Club. Retrieved on June 30th, 2009.</ref> DC Perry of 411mania.com approved of Craig "letting the air out of the usual 'Crazy Crap Just Happens to Us' formula" used in most of the ''South Park'' storylines, throughout the episodes "[[Pandemic]]" and "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]". Perry was also pleased that the character "got to shine for more than random flip-offs" and "didn't even have to try".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081102044806/http://www.411mania.com/movies/dvd_reviews/89107/South-Park-10.29.08:-Pandemic-2---The-Startling.htm South Park 10.29.08: Pandemic 2 - The Startling.] DC Perry, 411mania.com.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Quest for Ratings]]", when Craig's school program is canceled, the teacher orders him to be [[wikipedia:Castration|castrated]]. It is never specified whether this was actually carried out.
*Craig likes a show called ''Red Racer''. This is a play on the show ''Speed Racer''.
*Craig can be seen rioting with the children at the Nebraska mall in "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"
*In "[[Le Petit Tourette]]" Craig is jealous of Cartman and expresses it by saying "If I could say (whatever Cartman said before) to (whoever Cartman said it to), I would be ''soooooooo'' happy." In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling|Pandemic 2]]", Craig says "Last week was my Birthday. My grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars. I was ''soooooooo'' happy." Later on in that episode, he says "...as for me, I was returned home by homeland security. My parents were ''soooooooo'' happy." This could be a minor catchphrase of his.
*Craig is also a fan of ''Lord of the Rings'' as seen in the season 6 episode "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]", in which he takes the role of Boromir from the movie. When Cartman says that the sixth graders can't stand water, Craig thinks it's stupid and decides to go back to the ''Harry Potter'' kids instead to play with them (along with the kindergartner [[Filmore]], who takes the role of Gimli the Dwarf).
*Craig's alter-ego in "[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]", [[Feldspar the Thief]], is a reference to the character "Craig Feldspar" from the show ''[[wikipedia:Malcolm in the Middle|Malcolm in the Middle]]''.
*Craig is one of the only two kids who has three different Fantasy incarnations, the other one being Clyde, who has different costumes for different incarnations. However, Craig's costume remains the same, likely due to the same reason that he has a rather simple costume in The Fractured But Whole.
*Craig might have a cat because his sister can be seen holding one in "[[Major Boobage]]".
*In the episode "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", one of several children playing FBI refers to himself as Agent Tucker.
*In the episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]", Craig actually dies in Cartman's dream. When the bus tilts, he can't hang on and falls out, screaming. He survives in real life.
*Craig's birthday was in the episode "[[Pandemic]]" and "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]".
*Craig's yellow poof on top of his hat is the same as Cartman's.
*Craig's tendency to flip off people is shown to stem from his family, who constantly flip each other off during dinner in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]". 
*Many fans believed that Craig was possibly related to [[Red]] due to the resemblance between Thomas Tucker and [[Skeeter]], who was thought to be Red's father. It was speculated that due to the similarities in their fathers, that he and Red were cousins and that Red's surname may be Tucker. This theory was disproved in "[[The Pandemic Special]]" which showed that Red had different parents.
*There is a green version of Craig waiting in line at [[Cartman Burger]] in "[[Ass Burgers]]". It's possible that it's Craig wearing another set of clothes or just another character. However, it is widely believed that this is not, in fact, Craig, as a normally-dressed Craig is shown in the previous scene. The "green Craig" is also seen eating lunch all the way back in the [[Season One]] episode "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]" at the South Park Elementary cafeteria.
*Craig weighs 45&nbsp;lbs (20.4&nbsp;kg), as revealed in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".
*Craig has spoken in every season since his first speaking role in [[Season Three]].
*Craig, along with Tweek, is the first child character in the series to be in a same-sex relationship.
*Craig is a fan of ''[[w:c:memory-alpha:Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', as seen by the poster of the [[w:c:memory-alpha:USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)]] in his room in "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]".
*According to Cartman in the episode "[[The List]]," Craig has "fucked up" teeth.
