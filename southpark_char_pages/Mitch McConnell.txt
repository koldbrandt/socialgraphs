'''Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.''' is an American politician and the senior Senator from Kentucky. He has acted as the Republican Senate leader since 2006. He appears in [[Season Twenty-One]] episode "[[Doubling Down]]".

==Background==
McConnell, [[Paul Ryan]], and [[Mike Pence]] enter the Oval Office where [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] is conversing with another world leader on the phone. When he hangs up they inform him about right pronunciation of an African country Niger and about a worker with ties to Russia was found "raped and executed". McConnell then questioned the president over his oath of office, and how he could put a positive spin to it. In response Garrison remotely closes the door behind them and tells them: "Hope you brought some condoms."

Later he is seen with Ryan and Pence wearing blankets over their suits discussing their chances of survival. As the trio were discussing the president's approval ratings, President Garrison walks in and asks them what they are doing. They all quickly responded nothing.

At Garrison's first anniversary in the office, the trio brought him a cake and sang the song "Happy Anniversary to you". After the president had blown the candles, McConnell commented that more years of the same are to come. However, Garrison responded that he does not think so, walking out from behind his desk with a giant dildo strapped to his genitals and adding that next three years are gonna be even better. All of them laugh in response, but soon begin to cry, as they know what that dildo means.

==Appearance==
McConnell wears a black suit with a navy blue tie and a pair of brown-framed glasses. He has gray hair with some blushes on his cheeks. After being raped by Garrison, he covers himself with a dark green towel.
