'''John Dickinson''' was an American lawyer and politician from Philadelphia and appeared in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]". He served as a Congressman, for Pennsylvania, and served a second term for Delaware.

==Background==
While in his self-induced flashback to 1776, Eric Cartman meets the Continental Congress and sees them argue and insult each other in a similar way the adults of his time do. John Dickinson is against the war of independence and wants to use peaceful diplomacy. [[John Adams]] believes war is inevitable and is the only way to be free from England and become a sovereign nation.

==Appearance==
John Dickinson is dressed in the typical clothes of the 18th century, with a gray wig, red waistcoat, black outer coat. His animated persona was stylistically more realistic than the normal round type used regularly.

==Quotes==
*"Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want!"
*"But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy."
*"We cannot found a country based on war! Right."
*"If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it."
