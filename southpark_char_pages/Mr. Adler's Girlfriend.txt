'''Mr. Adler's Girlfriend''' is a woman and pilot who was engaged to [[Richard Adler]], the shop class teacher at [[South Park Elementary]], until her passing. She appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".

==Background==
She had training as a pilot and seemed confident in her abilities with an airplane. She died in a skywriting accident while trying to write "I Love U Richard" in the sky. Richard was heartbroken and still mourning her death for much of the events of "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", and he had several flashbacks to his memories with her. These flashbacks are notable for being depicted in live-action and from a first-person perspective.

A picture of her appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as an item, but the picture was in the normal South Park animation instead of live-action.

==Appearance==
She is seen wearing lots of different clothes and outfits. She is seen in her pilot's uniform, a long white flowery dress, a brown patterned cardigan, and also a pink shirt and red lipstick. She has long wavy brown hair and wears earrings.

==Trivia==
*This is the first live-action ''South Park'' character to be part of the series canon.
*Even though she died in a plane crash, blood can be seen and is shot at her while she is still flying the plane.
**When she is in the water later, the blood from her face is completely gone.
