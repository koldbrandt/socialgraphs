'''Nichole Daniels''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. She makes her first appearance in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Cartman Finds Love]]". Starting with [[Season Seventeen]], she has made numerous appearances since.

==Background==
Nichole is the new girl at South Park Elementary, much to the happiness of the [[List of Male 4th Graders|male students]], especially [[Eric Cartman]]. Seeing this as an opportunity for [[Token Black]] to have a girlfriend, Cartman begins a plan to have the two brought together.

Nichole, initially showing interest in [[Kyle Broflovski]], eventually started to like Token, after being locked in the boy's locker room with him for several hours. With aid from Cartman, Nichole and Token formed a strong relationship, until she read the engraving Cartman had put on the tag of one of the stuffed bears from Token. Unbeknownst to Token, the engraving read, "'Cuz Blacks Belong Together", which caused Nichole to break up with him, believing they were not on the "same page".

Realizing that Nichole was now "available", Kyle begins a relationship with her, taking her to a basketball game featuring the Denver Nuggets against the L.A. Clippers. At the game, Cartman sings "[[I Swear]]" to Kyle, much to his embarrassment. This causes Kyle to reveal to Nichole that Cartman was the one that set up her and Token. After hearing this, Nichole runs into Token at the game, they reconcile their relationship, and decide to get back together.

==Appearance==
Nichole wears black shoes, magenta pants, a white shirt, and a yellow jacket. She has black hair, styled into two buns, and wears two yellow barrettes with pink flowers on them. Sometimes, when she is outside, she wears a pair of pink mittens. According to Wendy, she has minor periorbital puffiness in her eyes.

Nichole is on the [[List of South Park Cows Sports Teams#Cheerleading Squad|cheerleading squad]]; she wears the typical South Park Cows cheerleading attire, which consists of a black and white dress with the word "cows" embroidered in the front. While cheerleading, she also wears yellow and pink barrettes, although occasionally she wears two ribbons instead.

{{GallerySubPage|name=Nichole Daniels}}

==Personality==
Nichole is shown to be nice, amiable and sympathetic. She understands Cartman's claims that he and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] were in a relationship in "[[Cartman Finds Love]]", and despite having a crush on the latter, offers them support. She has also shown to be discreet, being careful in her words and actions not to offend anyone. This is shown when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], posing as a homosexual, asks her not to touch him in the same episode, believing that sexuality influences platonic interactions.

She is also determined, following through with the girls plan to break up with their boyfriends in "[[Skank Hunt]]", to get back at them for [[Skankhunt42]]'s wrongdoings. She helps [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] convince [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] to do the same, further stating that without all the girls committing, their plan is meaningless.

She may be among the most well behaved children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], as she has yet to swear (up until "[[Board Girls]]"), lie, cheat, break a law, or any other form of bad behavior, willingly, so far in the series. She did take part in sighing in an exasperated way at [[Lisa Berger]] in "[[The Hobbit]]".

She is romantic. She has had romantic interests for, and has been the love interest for, many of the boys in the school, before and after photoshopping herself in "[[The Hobbit]]".

She has also demonstrated a level of insecurity in her skin color. While PhotoShopping herself in "[[The Hobbit]]", she lightened her skin. She also has a poster of a blonde Caucasian fairy above her bed.

==Interactions==
===[[Token Black]]===
[[File:TokenNichole1.png|200px|thumb|Nichole and [[Token Black|Token]] meeting in the boys locker room.]]
Nichole and Token began their relationship with each other after being locked inside of the boys locker room for hours. The two's relationship grew stronger, as they were both seen on several dates and visiting amusement parks together. Their relationship was later disrupted by a racist remark and, after learning that Cartman was behind it, Nichole and Token reconciled their relationship.

In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Nichole breaks up with Token due to the actions of internet troll [[Skankhunt42]]; the girls believed that his actions spoke for all the boys.

In "[[Dead Kids]]", Nichole tells Cartman that she and Token are trying to make their relationship work again.

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===
Nichole and Kyle both formed a mutual attraction to one another shortly after she arrived at school. However, when Cartman told her he and Kyle were in a homosexual relationship, she chose to back off out of respect; despite this, she still attempted to befriend Kyle. After she briefly ended her relationship with Token, Kyle took her to a basketball game, but any chance of a potential relationship brewing was once again thwarted due to Cartman's intervention. She and Kyle have scarcely interacted afterwards, but it can be presumed they are on friendly terms.

Nichole has occasionally shown an interest in getting Kyle to be more open about his feelings; in her debut episode, she encourages Kyle to talk to her if he feels alone, and in "[[Doubling Down]], she is the first to inquire that Kyle may have feelings for [[Heidi Turner]].

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
In "[[Board Girls]]" Nichole is revealed to be a big board game buff, along with Stan and minor characters [[Tammy Nelson]] and [[Kelly Pinkerton-Tinfurter]]. While she and Stan never interacted much on screen besides their brief fangirling over BBG, Stan thinks she is cool to play with.

===[[Tammy Nelson]]===
When Nichole and Tammy join the boys' board game club, they have prepared characters for dungeons and dragons together beforehand. This indicates a friendship between the two girls.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
[[File:StickofTruthCows.jpeg|right|220px]]
Although she did not officially appear in the game, her appearance was planned. She can be seen in promotional artwork for the game. From the promotional artwork, it can be assumed that she would have played a relatively larger role as a cheerleader, along with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], possibly in a battle against [[Red]], and the stupid Spoiled whores. Her prominence in the game could have been further confirming her permanent role as a part of the series' cast. The reason for her exclusion from the game's final draft is unknown.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Nichole can be found in her bedroom with [[Red McArthur|Red]] on the first day of gameplay, where they are playing cards and talking about  boys. [[The New Kid]] is able to follow her on [[Coonstagram]] and obtain a selfie. Her [[William Daniels|dad]] is falsely accused of being a "drug dealer" by [[Harrison Yates]] and arrested during the [[Operation: Just 'Cause]] mission, but after the game's storyline is finished, she and her dad can be found playing cards at the dining room table.
