The '''Frog King''' (sometimes mistakenly '''Frog Prince''') is an animal ghost that first appeared in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]".

==Background==
Frog King is a spirit animal that lives in [[Mr. Slave]]'s digestive system along with two other spirit animals, [[Sparrow Prince]] and [[Catatafish]]. He helps Lemmiwinks get out of Mr. Slave's body at the end by escaping through his mouth.

In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", the Frog King appears to Paris Hilton after [[Mr. Slave]] traps her in his digestive system by stuffing her up his buttocks.

In "[[Bass to Mouth]]", the Frog King appeared to [[Lemmiwinks]] to warn the rodent that his brother [[Wikileaks]]' mischief at [[South Park Elementary]]. He trains Lemmiwinks to fight his evil gossiping brother and leads the children to the fight between the two rats.

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', the Frog King appeared to guide [[The New Kid]] to navigate inside Mr. Slave's rectum on a quest to disarm the Snuke to save South Park from being destroyed by a nuclear blast.

==Appearance==
The Frog King wears a king's crown and a unisex robe, and carries a royal scepter.

*"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"
*"[[Bass to Mouth]]"

==Trivia==
*Sparrow Prince claims that he had been stuck in Mr. Slave's body for years prior Lemmiwinks meeting him there, meaning it could be that he alongside the Frog King and Catatafish were also once inserted as normal animals (whose skeletons can be seen near his anus area) into Mr. Slave's ass before dying there.
