The '''Midget Wearing a Bikini''' (sometimes simply '''Midget in a Bikini''') is a news reporter for the [[Channel 4 News]]. He first appears in "[[Pinkeye]]", and reappears in the film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', as well as in the video games ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
Midget Wearing a Bikini is similar to the other reporters, who also have unusual and bizarre names, such as [[Creamy Goodness]], [[Quadriplegic Swiss Man on a Pony]], [[Tom Pusslicker]], [[Chris Swollenballs]], and "[[A 34-Year-Old Asian Man Who Looks Strikingly Similar to Ricardo Montalbán]]".

==Appearance==
As his name suggests, he is a midget wearing a pink bikini. He has short black hair, a black mustache, and short, hairy legs.

==Prominence==
*"[[Pinkeye]]" - Reports the Pinkeye epidemic that is spreading throughout the town.
===''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''===
Reports the effects [[Terrance and Phillip]] have on the [[The 4th Grade|children]] of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Reports a [[Visitors|UFO]] crash, while reassuring the public that there is nothing to fret.
===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Reports the disturbances made by an unknown public vigilante; the [[Douchebag|new kid]].

==Trivia==
*He has only ever appeared in a single episode of the main series, despite being the main news reporter in spinoff material for years afterward.
*He has the second most appearances on any on-site news reporter character after [[Chris Swollenballs]], though he has fewer than [[Bill Keegan]]
