'''Roy''' was [[Sharon Marsh]]'s boyfriend in [[Season Two]] episode "[[Clubhouses]]".

==Background==
Immediately after Sharon and [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] get divorced, Roy moves into the [[Marsh Residence|Marsh's house]]. Roy tries to get [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to accept and love him as his new father. He initially acts nice and caring towards Stan, but when Stan does not accept him immediately, he gets upset and lashes out at him. Fed up with him, Stan gets the idea to set up a rope trap on him.

At the end of the episode, Roy is seen still hanging from the rope, yelling for help and saying he is hungry.

==Appearance==
Roy wears a brown sweater, blue jeans, black shoes and also wears a pair of black circle-shaped glasses. He had a rather small round head with brown hair and a gray, short, stubbly beard.

==Personality==
He is shown to be emotionally unstable, as shown by his volatile temper. He acts nice and caring at first, but gets angry within a few seconds, sometimes over very minor things.

==Interactions==
===[[Sharon Marsh]]===
Roy was Sharon's new boyfriend after she divorced Randy. She stayed with him until she dared Randy to have sex with her and they made up. After meeting Stan, Roy immediately tried to take on the role of his father.

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
Roy was Stan's stepfather. He was initially nice and caring towards Stan, but after Stan simply shrugs it off, he overreacts and yells at him. Roy often tells Stan to chop firewood after these incidents, so much that Stan stated they had enough for twelve years.
