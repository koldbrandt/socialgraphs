'''John Warsog''' is the head of [[Cartoon Central]] who appears in the [[Season One]] episode "[[Death]]".

==Background==
When [[Sheila Broflovski]] tries to rally up the townspeople to protest getting [[Terrance and Phillip]] off the air, John Warsog comes out of the building to give a statement, however his statement is him simply saying "fuck you" and mooning the crowd.

By the end of the episode, the protest gets too out of hand, so John agrees to take Terrance and Phillip of the air and instead replace it with She's the Sheriff.

==Appearance==
John wears a black business suit, a white undershirt, a black tie, gray pants, and black shoes. He has brown poofy hair and brown eyebrows.
