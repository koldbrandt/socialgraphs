{{Featured Winner|June 2010}}
'''Visitors''' are the aliens who came to Earth and gave [[Eric Cartman]] an [[Anal Probe]] in the pilot episode, "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]". They also kidnapped [[Ike Broflovski]] later in the same episode. After observing Planet Earth, Visitors came to the conclusion that cows were the most intelligent species on earth.

==Background==
''[[South Park|South Park's]]'' animators have "hidden" visitors in many episodes, although the frequency has decreased as the series has progressed. They poke fun at this practice in "[[Cancelled]]" when the receptionist at the proctologists office is a Visitor disguised only in a wig. Then to the sound of percussive music, this Visitor dramatically removes his / her wig. In later seasons, it was a contest for viewers to find where they were hidden.

==Appearance==
Visitors are typical looking aliens (like Roswell) with gray skin. They are tall and skinny with tear drop shaped heads. They have tall skinny eyes and no noses. They do not wear clothing and do not have any addition distinguishing features.

==Trivia==
*Carl is the only named Visitor. He is one of the Visitors that gave Eric Cartman an anal probe. He was new and was accidentally turning cows inside out.
*The hidden Visitor in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]" on the 'Our Pets' board is also named Carl.
*The Visitors' language consists of only one word, "Moo". This is likely because they studied cows, and learned to imitate their language.

==Prominence==
In the show, there is a long running gag of Visitors appearing, hidden in many episodes of the show.

*"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" - First Appearance, kidnapped Cartman and Ike; believed cows were smartest life forms on Earth.
