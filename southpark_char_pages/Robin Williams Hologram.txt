The '''Robin Williams Hologram''' was featured in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]". He was modeled after the famous comedian whose tragic and shocking death happened months before this episode. He was the only celebrity hologram to only have a cameo appearance.

==Background==
Robin Williams Hologram is a computer program designed by [[Syntech Hologram Company]]. It was said to perform at the "''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]"'', but was only seen in the opening.

===Real===
The real Robin Williams was a huge fan of South Park. He performed Stone and Parker's song [[Blame Canada]] at the 1999 Oscars. Ironically, the original choice to sing it, [[Mary Kay Bergman]], the female's voice actress fell into a depression and committed suicide just like Robin.

==Appearance==
When Robin appeared as a hologram, he wore reindeer antlers and a red Rudolph nose, which may be a reference to ''Patch Adams''.
