The Special Olympics Volunteers are tasked with several duties, ranging from manning the registration booth, to officiating the various sport events. When [[Eric Cartman]] attempts to register for the Special Olympics, [[Liane Cartman|his mother]] was not sure of his condition when asked by a volunteer, instead replying that he is "retarded".
