==Personality==
Peter Mullen is seen as a stereotypical geek/nerd. He has interests that are seen as odd to others, displays a high sense of intelligence, and is socially awkward. His most impactful contribution to the show is his presentation on "murder porn" in "[[Informative Murder Porn]]", where he convinces the student body that it was a bad thing. Despite these characteristics, it appears that the girls of [[South Park Elementary]] like him, as they ranked him [[The List/Trivia#The "Real" List|sixth on the real attractiveness list]].

==Trivia==
*In "[[T.M.I.]]", he was listed by the school as Leroy Jenkins, a reference to the famous internet meme featuring a ''World of Warcraft'' character of the same name.
*In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', his name is given as '''Leroy Mullens''', combining his original and later names. He can be seen in detention and perched above the News Office. He calls himself a goblin waiting to steal gold.
