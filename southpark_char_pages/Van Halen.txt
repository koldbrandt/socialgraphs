'''Van Halen''' were an American hard rock band formed in the mid 1970s and was active until 2020. They appeared in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Ginger Cow]]".

==Background==
The band performed in Jerusalem at the unification rally of the three Abrahamic faiths; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Before a packed stadium of all three adherents, the symbols of each faith melded together on a projected screen to form the Van Halen "VH" band logo. The rock group then launched into their most successful song "[[Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love]]" from their debut album ''Van Halen'' (1978). A CNN reporter on a rooftop proclaimed a ten-year peace party between the faiths as the concert proceeded behind him. Later, the band performed "[[Hot for Teacher]]" from their sixth album ''MCMLXXXIV'' or popularly known as ''1984''.
