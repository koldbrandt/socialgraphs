'''Sidney Poitier''' is an American actor  who appears in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", in which he assists the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in defeating [[Barbra Streisand]] by transforming into a Japanese ''kaiju'' form. Although both he and [[Leonard Maltin]] fail in their efforts, [[Robert Smith]] manages to destroy Streisand in the end.

==Background==
In "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", Poitier transforms into a [[w:c:godzilla:Gamera|Gamera]]-like monster in order to fight Mecha-Streisand. He is tossed into a mountain by her and has yet to make another appearance. Although he helps defeat Mecha Streisand, Poitier did in fact seem pretty villainous when he heard that she had the diamond, he probably planning on using it for his own purposes.

==Appearance==

Before he transformed, Sidney wore green pants, a white shirt with a black tie, and a brown coat. He has black hair but has graying sideburns. 

After he transformed, he appears similar to Gamera, a creature from the Gamera series. His transformation looks like a giant tortoise with large muscles with a human head.
