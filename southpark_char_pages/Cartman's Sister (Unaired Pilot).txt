'''[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s Sister''' is a deleted character who appears in the unreleased pilot episode, "[[The Unaired Pilot]]". She was seen in the scene where the Cartman family is having dinner in the dining room but does not move or speak during the scene.

==Appearance==

She has light brown hair with a ponytail and bangs. She was seen wearing a dark pink coat, light blue pants, and black shoes. In the family portrait, she was wearing a pale green sweater, a black shirt, and dark blue pants.

==Changes==
According to [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], the creators of ''[[South Park]]'', Cartman's family was originally going to be larger consisting of four members (Cartman, [[Liane Cartman|Liane]], [[Cartman's Father (Unaired Pilot)|Cartman's Father]], and Cartman's Sister). However, shortly after [[Comedy Central]] adopted the series in 1997, they decided to downgrade Cartman's family to consist of only Eric and Liane because Cartman did not need a large family and thus Cartman's Sister (along with their father) were cut from the series.{{Cite}}
