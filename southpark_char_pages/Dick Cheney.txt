'''Richard "Dick" Bruce Cheney''' was the Forty-Sixth Vice President of the United States, serving under [[George Bush]] from 2001 until 2009. He was succeeded as vice president by Joe Biden. Cheney was also White House Chief of Staff under [[Gerald Ford]] and the Secretary of Defense under the elder Bush. Cheney has also become well remembered for an incident in which he accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a Texas attorney and friend, while hunting. This has been widely parodied in the media and is often cited in criticism of Cheney.

==Background==
[[Image:Cheney2.JPG|thumb|left|Cheney in "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"]]
He first appeared in the episode, "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", pointing out to the General that the traces of weapons of mass destruction look like a seagull. He did not reappear until "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]", as a member of [[George Bush|George Bush's]] inner circle and part of the 9/11 cover-up. He has a new look including hunting gear as he attempts to kill [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], prompting Bush to curse that Cheney has missed again. He has not appeared since.

==Appearance==
In both of his appearances, he wears a blue suit with a white shirt and a yellow tie. He is animated differently in both of his appearances so consequentially his face and clothes have significantly more detail in "Mystery of the Urinal Deuce". In both cases, he is animated with gray receding hair, gray eyebrows and wrinkles on his face, cheeks, and neck. He also wears black glasses with round, gray frames.

==Prominence==
