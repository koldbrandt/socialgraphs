{{LinkDisambig|Thomas (Disambiguation)}}
'''Tommy Petey Turner''' is a student at [[South Park Elementary]]. He first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".

==Background==
While in shop class, he comically belt-sanded his face leaving it blank. He was then sent to the nurse's office by [[Richard Adler|Mr. Adler]]. His face was later restored in subsequent episodes.

==Appearance==
He has curly brown hair and wears an orange shirt with a zipper on it, brown shoes, and dark blue trousers. At first, he appeared with absolutely nothing where his face would have been. Since watching [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] fight, his face is shown normally.
