==Trivia==
*Justin Bieber, along with [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Star Wars Kid]], and [[Tom Green]], is one of the few [[Canada#Canadians|Canadian]] celebrities who are not given a traditional Canadian appearance in the series (the floppy head and beady eyes). This was done to make them more identifiable.
*The way that Justin Bieber dances at his concert is reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]], especially in the way he grabs his crotch.
*Although Justin had a high-pitched voice when the episode aired, the one used in the episode is mockingly much higher.
*[[Butters Stotch]] mentioned him in "[[T.M.I.]]", stating that he was angry at all the kids in school acting like "little Justin Biebers".
*In "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]", [[CartmanBrah]] mentions in his commentary that a producer who looks to be in his 40s but still has a Justin Bieber haircut.
*A possible reason why Justin Bieber was killed was because of his 'hit' song of that time, which was "[[Baby]]" was disliked by many netizens on [[YouToob|YouTube]]. It had 11 million dislikes over 13 million likes, as of 13 July 2020. This was YouTube's 2nd most disliked video of all time.
