'''Harold Cartman''' is the maternal grandfather of [[Eric Cartman]], [[Liane Cartman|Liane Cartman's]] father and husband and widower of [[Mabel Cartman]]. His only physical appearance was in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]". He was not seen in his wife's funeral in [[Cartmanland]] for unknown reasons.

==Background==
In "[[South Park is Gay!]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is arguing with [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and notes that he is half-bisexual. When [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] asserts that he is not, Cartman responds, ''"Well, my grandpa was bi, so that makes me a quarter bi!"'' However, these statements may be fabricated. Harold Cartman is later mentioned in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]", when [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] asked Cartman if he wanted to talk to him on the phone.

==Appearance==
Like most of the Cartman family, he is morbidly obese. Harold's face is extremely wrinkled, most likely due to his age. He has balding, gray hair, and wears a red shirt and brown pants.
