He is incredibly tall (taller than most, if not all the other people of South Park) and somewhat fat. He wears a blue sweater and brown trousers. Under his sweater is a white shirt. He has orange-red hair, although he seems to be balding. He also has a protruding chin. In "[[South Park is Gay!]]" he wore a nearly-unbuttoned red shirt, pink scarf, gold necklace, a belt, and striped white pants.

==Personality==
Thomas has displayed an uncaring attitude. In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", when Craig tells his family about the fight that is going to occur, Craig's father replies with an indifferent "Oh", not caring in the slightest, which results in the whole family giving each other the middle finger. However, he does seem to show some concern for his son in later episodes. For example, he is shown to be really worried about Craig's absence during "[[Pandemic]]".

In "[[The Magic Bush]]", he is really supportive of his wife and her privacy.

In "[[Tweek x Craig]]", he was happy when he heard Craig was involved in a fight, implying that he encourages Craig's "bad boy" attitude. Later, when he finds out it was a "lover's quarrel with his boyfriend" he is angry and complains about it, stating that homosexuality is something they did not accept in his times, and even though he recognizes that "maybe it's not so wrong", he doesn't want his son to be gay. Nevertheless, at the end of the episode, he supports Craig and tells him that he loves him. Even in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' he appears as a [[Yaoi]] amateur.

==Family==
===[[Craig Tucker]]===
Craig is his 10-year-old son. In "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", their interactions do not seem to show that he has an even remotely close bond with Craig. He appears indifferent and uninterested in Craig getting into a fight.

However, he and his wife were visibly upset and were seen crying when they send Craig away, along with the rest of the kids in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], in "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]". In "[[Pandemic]]", after Craig goes missing, Thomas and his wife appear to be very worried about Craig and even sticks up for him after the other boys' parents call him a bad influence. In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", Thomas and his wife are overjoyed when Craig returns [[Tucker Residence|home]].

===[[Laura Tucker]]===
He does not seem to have an incredibly close bond with his wife; in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", their interactions seem to show only a tenuous relationship between the two. However, they are shown consoling each other in later episodes.

===[[Tricia Tucker]]===
Due to a lack of interaction, their relationship remains unknown.
