'''Edgar Allan Poe''', or '''"Nightpain"''', was an American author and poet who appeared as a ghost in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", although he was referenced in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Raisins]]", when he appeared on [[Stan Marsh]]'s shirt, as he had temporarily turned goth.

==Background==
[[File:GothKids3DawnofthePosers000.png|thumb|left|Edgar's appearance in the book [[Henrietta]] was reading at the beginning of the episode.]]In order to fight the emo scourge, the [[Goth Kids|Goths]] and [[South Park Vampire Society|Vampires]] summon Poe as a ghost. Upon being summoned, Poe insults emos as "wannabe conformists", vampires as "douchey", and [[Goth Kids#Pete|Pete]] as a "poser". In the car, on the way to stop the emos, he states that his "goth name" is Nightpain, thus identifying himself as a goth. After helping to infiltrate [[Troubled Acres]], Poe abandons the group, instead choosing to drink coffee at the [[Village Inn]]. However, he does eventually return to reveal that the "emo plants" are actually just regular ficus plants from Lowe's Home and Garden. 

==Appearance==
Edgar Allan Poe has disheveled, black hair, black eyeliner around his eyes, and a black mustache. He appears wearing a black, nineteenth-century suit consisting of a black coat, black pants, a white shirt, a gray tie, and black shoes. He also often has a cigarette.
