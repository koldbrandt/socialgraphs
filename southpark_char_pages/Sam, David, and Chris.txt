When the television show ''[[Cop Drama]]'' announces that they will be saying the word "shit" uncensored on TV, Randy and his friends Sam, David, and Chris are seen discussing about the event, saying that they will allow their children to watch the show. Later on, they are seen watching ''Cop Drama'' at [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|the bar]], where David can be seen contracting the "black death" from saying the word "shit" too much, possibly indicating that he may have died later on.
