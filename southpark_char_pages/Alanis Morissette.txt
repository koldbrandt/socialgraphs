'''Alanis Nadine Morissette''' is a Canadian singer, songwriter, producer, and occasional actress, best known for songs like "Hand in My Pocket", "Ironic", and "You Oughtta Know".

==Background==
She recorded the song "[[Stinky Britches]]" in the episode "[[Chef Aid]]", which was originally written by [[Chef]]. Later in the episode, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] is seen watching the music video, a parody of the music video of her song "Ironic".

Later, in the episode "[[Christian Rock Hard]]", Morissette joins the strike against illegal music downloading.

In "[[Where My Country Gone?]]", Cartman tries to convince Butters to ask a Canadian girl out and points out that one of them sort of looks like the singer. Butters quickly expresses his disgusts with the singer, saying "Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something!".

Morissette's voice was performed by [[Toddy Walters]]. Like several Canadian celebrities, including [[Tom Green]] in "[[Fat Camp]]" and [[Justin Bieber]] in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", despite being Canadian, she does not resemble the stereotypical Canadian, such as [[Terrance and Phillip|Terrance or Phillip]].

==Appearance==
Alanis has messy, black, mid-arm length hair. She wears mascara as well as red lipstick. She also wears a white coat and black pants.

==Personality==
She seems to have a lust for money, taking credit for [[Chef]]'s song in "[[Chef Aid]]" as well as joining a strike against music piracy in "[[Christian Rock Hard]]".

==Prominence==
*"[[Chef Aid]]" - Debut.
*"[[Christian Rock Hard]]"
*"[[Where My Country Gone?]]" (mentioned)

==Trivia==
*One of her albums, ''Naked & Crying'', can be seen being thrown into the pile of Canadian merchandise in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.
*The Canadian girl that Cartman says looks like Alanis in "[[Where My Country Gone?]]" is wearing the same beanie, scarf, jacket and gloves that the singer wore in the music video for her single, "[https://youtu.be/Jne9t8sHpUc Ironic]".
*Although she is Canadian, Morrisette is not depicted with the flip-top head and beady eyes characteristic of Canadians in ''[[South Park]]''.
