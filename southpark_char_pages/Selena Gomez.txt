'''Selena Gomez''' is an American actress, singer, and animal rights activist. She is also a member of several charitable foundations. She appears in the episode "[[Bass to Mouth]]".

==Background==
Likely due to her wholesome, kind, and charitable persona, [[Eric Cartman]] requested that she get beaten up by the school staff as the reward for his efforts against [[Wikileaks]]' antics. Selena Gomez was lured in by [[Richard Adler|Mr. Adler]] when [[Mr. Mackey]] and [[Principal Victoria]] took turns assaulting her. Then, Mr. Adler sent her out of the room, thus making Cartman satisfied enough to not blackmail the school.

==Appearance==
Selena Gomez wears gray pants, tall brown boots, a yellow shirt with teal stripes, and a purple scarf. She also wears large gold earrings, a purple wristband on her right arm and pink and orange ones on her left arm, a conservative amount of makeup, and can be seen holding a pink handbag. She has long black hair and rosy red cheeks.

==Trivia==
*While on a dinner date with [[Justin Bieber]], Selena was assaulted in a restaurant by a fan of his a few weeks before "[[Bass to Mouth]]" aired. This may have been the inspiration for her appearance in the show.
