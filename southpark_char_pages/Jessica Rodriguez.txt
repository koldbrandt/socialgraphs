'''Jessica "Jessie" Rodriguez''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female 4th grader]] who appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

==Background==
When the girls disguise [[The New Kid]] as a girl in front of the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]] to try and find out who the two-faced bitch is, they state that they can't go inside the clinic themselves, as people will think they're sluts like Jessica Rodriguez. Immediately after, Jessica shows up, saying hello to them. They say hello back and act friendly to her, but [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] calls her a skank after she leaves. She then will immediately give The New Kid a friend request as he enters the clinic.

==Appearance==
Jessica has long brown hair and the same thin black eyebrows as most other child characters. She wears a red top, a red skirt, black shoes, and a small white earring on each ear.
