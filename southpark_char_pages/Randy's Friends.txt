'''Randy's Friends''' are a group of four local men that appear in [[Season Three]] episode "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", dressed up as [[the boys]].

==Background==
Randy was tasked by [[Mayor McDaniels]] to investigate the cause of spontaneous combustion among the townspeople. As part of his experiment on the case of [[Kenny McCormick]], he requested four men to dress up as the boys and walk around the lab, but did not manage to retrieve any findings. The men started to complain about Randy breaking his promise to go drink beer with them and watch sports. As a result, the man dressed up as Cartman decided to leave, behaving similarly to his counterpart.

==Appearance==
The men are dressed up as the boys. Some notable differences are the different hair colors for the men dressing up as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], a mustache for the man dressing up as Kyle, as well as a full beard for the man dressing up as Cartman.

==Trivia==
*At the time this episode aired, only Cartman had been seen without his hat, and Stan and Kyle's hair colors were unknown, so it was unknown if the men representing Stan and Kyle were intended to resemble them accurately at the time.
