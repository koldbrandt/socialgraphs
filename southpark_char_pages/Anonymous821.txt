'''Anonymous821''', whose real name is unknown, was an internet troll who first appeared in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Wieners Out]]". 

==Background==
In "[[Wieners Out]]", he is seen briefly at a once undisclosed location when [[Dildo Shwaggins]] brings [[Gerald Broflovski]] to the secret troll meeting.

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", the meeting is revealed to be taking place at [[Airport Hilton]]. After Shwaggins and Gerald coordinate the troll, Anonymous821 joins the trolls and signs in to multiple online accounts.

In "[[Fort Collins]]", he is only seen briefly at the impromptu troll party at the [[Broflovski Residence]]. He later leaves after Gerald insists the trolls leave.

In "[[Oh, Jeez]]", he is captured by [[TrollTrace.com]] after believing he had been hired by [[Hillary Clinton]] to infiltrate and sabotage the service. He then spends the rest of Season Twenty imprisoned in their headquarters.

===Office===
Anonymous821's office is decorated with masks and Anonymous posters. To his right are several masks and a book case. In front of him are two computers, and to his left is a large panel television. He sits in high-back gaming chair.

==Appearance==
Anonymous821 is overweight, and is most noted by his Guy Fawkes mask. He typically wears a Minneapolis Millers jersey over a black, long sleeve tee shirt.
