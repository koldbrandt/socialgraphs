'''Daniel''' is a character who appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[T.M.I.]]"

==Background==
Daniel attends an anger management class to help control his anger, which, like the other members of the group, is implied to be caused by him having a small penis. He joins the other members when they become the "Pissed Off and Angry Party" and attacks the [[FedEx Office]] until the national average for penis size is changed.

Daniel claims to get most angry at "stupid-ass blind liberals".

==Appearance==
Daniel wears a orange-brownish jacket, gray pants, and black shoes. Underneath his jacket, he wears a white shirt with an image of the American flag and the words "WAKE UP AMERICA!" written on it. He has a pin with an image of [[Barack Obama]] in a "no" circle on his jacket. He also wears a hat with a bow and some teabags hanging from it. He has gray hair, gray eyebrows, and a gray mustache.
