The''' Goth Kids''' are the group of goth children at [[South Park Elementary]]. Introduced in the episode "[[Raisins]]", they became regular background characters with occasional big roles including one episode where they even took over the title sequence and sung their own original version with new lyrics, the first characters to have done so.

They are usually seen hanging around the caf√© [[Benny's]] and the [[Village Inn]]. They also hang out behind the school, near the loading bay and parking lot and in [[Henrietta's Bedroom]]. They all wear black clothes and eyeliner and have black hair and pale skin as well as being heavy smokers.

==Background==
The Goth Kids are very stereotypical goths. They rarely go to school and prefer to sit around all day drinking coffee and smoking. They constantly go on about how pointless and painful life is. They go to the cemetery often, where they write poems about death and sorrow. They take to calling those who are not goths "[[Britney Spears|Britney (Spears)]] and [[Justin Timberlake|Justin (Timberlake)]] wannabes". They also dance by looking down at the ground, with their hands at their sides, and every three seconds they take a drag on their cigarettes.

To them, everyone who follows along with life as usual and the path of average citizens are "conformists", whom they despise, they state that their purpose in life is to make life more miserable for the conformists. They hate the South Park Vampire Society more than conformists, as everyone else mistakes them for being vampires rather than Goth.
They have also joined a cult group that worships [[Cthulhu]] and is involved with the [[Necronomicon]]. [[Coon and Friends]] figure this is because the cult's ideals fit in with their goth lifestyle. However, they quickly leave the cult after seeing nothing has changed and assist [[Mysterion]] in learning Cthulhu's weakness.

Despite hating conformists, [[Michael]] ironically tells [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in "[[Raisins]]" that in order to hang out with them, he would have to dress like them and do whatever they do.

The goth kids also are into gothic literature as well, including the author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and HP Lovecraft. They also have an interest in gothic rock, post-punk, darkwave, and industrial music.

===Names===
[[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]]'s name was given officially in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Raisins]]". [[Pete]], Michael, and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]], however, did not have their names revealed until the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]". Firkle's real name was revealed to be Georgie Smith in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Franchise Prequel]]". In "[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]" when taking a picture with the goths, Pete's last name is revealed to be "Thelman". However there is apparently another background character with the exact same name, causing much confusion among fans. 

===Criminal Record===
The Goth Kids have collectively and individually engaged in numerous criminal offences.
*'''Arson:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", they set fire to the South Park [[Hot Topic]] store, burning it to the ground.
*'''Attempted Murder:''' Firkle attempts to kill Mysterion in "[[Mysterion Rises]]", but the [[Cthulhu Cult Leader]] does so instead.
*'''Attempted Murder / Kidnapping:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", they kidnap [[Mike Makowski]], the leader of the [[South Park Vampire Society]], with the intent of murdering him. After he admits he isn't a vampire, however, they change their minds and ship him off to Scottsdale, Arizona instead.
*'''Drug Abuse / Underage Smoking: '''The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their age (5 to 11), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Grand Theft Auto / Driving Without A License:''' In "[[The Ungroundable]]", they take [[Harriet Biggle|Henrietta's mother]]'s car without her permission, and are clearly too young to have even a learner's permit.
*'''Hostage-Taking / Terrorism:''' In "[[T.M.I.]]" Michael participates in the Pissed Off and Angry Party's taking of hostages at the Fed-Ex offices.
*'''Treason / Sedition:''' In "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", they are shown to be part of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] and support the [[Cthulhu|eponymous monster's]] reign of terror. They later leave the cult, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome.

==Main Members==
===Henrietta Biggle===
{{Main|Henrietta Biggle}}
[[File:Henrietta-biggle.png|thumb|Henrietta Biggle]]
'''Henrietta Biggle''' was the first and currently only female goth kid. Her bedroom is another place where the Goths hang out where they read depressing poems about how much they hate conformists. Henrietta despises her mother because she usually interrupts Henrietta whenever she is reading a poem. Mrs. Biggle takes this as Henrietta's normal goth behavior. During the events of "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", Henrietta's parents send her to a [[Troubled Acres|camp]] attempting to improve her attitude. The camp temporarily turns her [[Emo Kids|emo]], before she reverts to her usual goth self.

===Michael===
{{Main|Michael}}
[[File:5th-9th-grader-michael.png|thumb|Michael]]
'''Michael''' is the oldest goth kid, in the fifth grade. In "[[You Got F'd in the A]]", he helps [[The South Park Diggities|Stan's dance team]] out in an effort to be the biggest non-conformist of all by not even conforming to Goth standards. He also suggests bringing [[Yao]] into the group.

{{Clear}}

===Pete===
{{main|Pete}}
[[File:Pete.png|thumb|Pete]]
'''Pete Thelman''' seems to be around the same age as Michael and Henrietta, and is in the fourth grade. He shows a little concern over the position he and the other goth kids are in when they were about to kill Mysterion. Despite not wanting to kill anyone he ends up going along with the other Goths after Michael says that killing is expected when you're a minion of Cthulhu.

{{Clear}}

===Firkle Smith===
{{main|Firkle Smith}}
[[File:Firkle.png|thumb|Firkle Smith]]
'''Georgie "Firkle" Smith''' is the youngest of the Goths, being in kindergarten. He says that most people are "Nazi conformist cheerleaders", and that he is the biggest non-conformist there is.

{{clear}}

== Former and Guest Members ==
===Raven (Stan Marsh)===
{{main|Stan Marsh}}
[[File:Alter-egos-stan-goth-stan.png|thumb|Stan as a Goth]]
Stan briefly became a Goth in the episode "[[Raisins]]", after [[Wendy Testaburger]] broke-up with him to be with [[Token Black|Token]] instead. Feeling depressed, he hung out with the Goth Kids as suggested by [[Kyle Broflovski]]. Pete called Stan '''"Raven"''', which was seemingly his new 'goth name'. He wore a black T-shirt which featured Edgar Allen Poe's face with the word "Nevermore" written above it which appears to be a band shirt of the metal band "Nevermore", It's also the name of a poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] that has a raven in it, which is where he gets his name from. He later quit the group, on advice from [[Butters Stotch]], after realizing that it is better to be sad and cheer up later rather than to have a Gothic attitude.

After this, it is implied that he was still in contact with the Goth Kids, as they knew about Wendy and Stan getting back together, referencing it in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]". However, the Goth Kids seem to still hold something of a grudge against Stan, calling him jock in a disparaging manner. Michael also helped Stan by joining his dance troupe in [[You Got F'd in the A]] by not "wanting to conform" with the rest of the Goth Kids who all refused.

{{clear}}

===Unnamed Goth Girl===
{{main|Unnamed Goth Girl}}
[[File:4th_graders_goth_girl_unamed.png|thumb|214px|Unknown Goth Girl in opening of Season 9.]]
There is another Goth girl that can be seen with the group in short non-speaking cameos on two occasions. Once in "[[Goobacks]]" she is seen helping the other Goth kids pick up garbage during the song "[[The Future Begins With You and Me]]" and again during the [[Season Nine]] intro sequence replacing Firkle.

{{clear}}

===Karen McCormick===
{{main|Karen McCormick}}
[[File:Goth-karen.png|thumb|Karen McCormick]]
'''Karen McCormick''' is the second youngest of the Goths. She is the sister of [[Kenny McCormick]], and looks up to her fellow female goth, Henrietta. Although not initially a Goth kid, she becomes one after the events of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'s'' "[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]" DLC but this is not continued after the events of the game.

{{clear}}

==Hang-out spots==
===[[Loading and Unloading Dock]]===
Their most common hang-out spot is the loading bay behind [[South Park Elementary]]. This is where the Goth Kids are first introduced when Stan Marsh requests to join them in "[[Raisins]]". This is where the Goth Kids are situated in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. They sit there and smoke and listen to Goth music.

===[[Henrietta's Bedroom]]===
The Goth Kids regularly hang-out in Henrietta's bedroom to sit in the dark, read gothic literature, write and perform poems about pain and dabble in the occult. The room is very dark and decked out with band posters, candles, skulls and other gothic items. Henrietta's mom often enters the room and interrupts much to Henrietta's dismay. This seems to be the only one of the Goth Kid's bedrooms they all get together at. This is where the Goth Kids are situated in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

===[[Benny's]]===
This diner was a former hang-out spot where the Goth Kids spent time drinking coffee and were often scolded by the waitress working there for spending all day sitting there drinking coffee.

===[[Village Inn]]===
This diner is the Goth Kids new hang-out spot to drink coffee. The interior is identical to Benny's and features the same hostile waitress so it's possibly the same building under new management though exterior shots do not match the background. This is likely just a continuity error.

Henrietta, Michael, Pete and Firkle can be found smoking and listening to Goth music at the Loading Bay behind [[South Park Elementary]]. They give [[The New Kid]] various missions to prove he's not a comformist such as dressing goth, being able to dance goth and holding up a sign saying "Fuck the Comformists" at a PTA meeting.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Henrietta, Michael, Pete and Firkle can be found in Henrietta's bedroom where they give [[The New Kid]] a mini side-quest to find the sacred tome and light the sacred candles to summon a chest in a flaming pentagram where upon opening you receive a reward of an arcane suit and goth bangs.

==Trivia==
*Despite the typical attitude of the Goth Kids, Pete and Henrietta are seen enthusiastically smiling and waving in the [[South Park Theme]]. Michael was seen smiling as well as cheering during the endings of "[[You Got F'd in the A]]" and "[[T.M.I.]]".
*Only Michael has featured in storylines not involving the other Goth Kids although [[Pete]] did have a cameo in "[[Basic Cable]]", an episode where none of the other Goth Kids made an appearance though Michael was mentioned.
*The Goth Kids are shown to be quite protective of one another, as seen in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", when Pete and Michael try to help Henrietta after she has turned Emo. They even risk their lives to bring her back to normal. At the end of "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", Pete tells Henrietta that they torched the [[Howard Flannigan|Emo plant leader]], so as to save her from the embarrassment of admitting she went Emo not by force, but of her own free will. This may also explain their disparaging treatment of Stan, as they may be hurt that he quit their group. Additionally, when talked to after [[the New Kid]] has proved themself to be a non-conformist in "[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]", Henrietta will tell them "Make yourself at home. You're safe here."
*Despite being protective of each other, all members have shown acts of disloyalty to the group with Henrietta and Firkle outright betraying the group to join the Emos, Pete referring to Michael as a "total poser" when trying to ask out Sophie Gray, and Michael "Goth-serving" the group to join Stan's dance troupe.
*Michael, Pete, and Firkle are referred to as Tall Goth, Hair Flip, and Little Goth, respectively, in the official script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/395724374495342592|title=official scripts}}</ref>
