'''Tricia Tucker''' is [[Craig Tucker]]'s younger sister, who first appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]" seated at the dinner table with her family. She later joined in as the rest of her family flipped each other off.

==Background==
She also appeared in the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[Major Boobage]]", where she was shown resisting the confiscation of a grey kitten, crying, "No! No!" after the ban on cats was enforced by the towns bureaucracy, in attempt to stop the cat urine drug abuse known as "cheesing".

In "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", she is seen in a photograph of Craig's tenth birthday. 

In "[[Butterballs]]", she can be seen sitting in front of [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] at the anti-bullying assembly.

==Appearance==
She wears a light blue shirt with a white flowering collar along with red pants. She appears to be about the age of five or six.

She closely resembles [[Millie Larsen]], one of Craig's classmates. She has the same color patterns as Millie, though her hair is in long, higher-up pigtails with red hair bands, as opposed to Millie's short, drooping ones.
