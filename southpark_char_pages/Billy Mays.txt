'''William Darrell "Billy" Mays Jr. '''was an American salesman who appeared in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Dead Celebrities]]". He was known for his loud, impassioned sales pitches, which many people held to be incredibly annoying.

==Background==
Billy Mays died in 2009 and his ghost haunted [[Ike Broflovski]]. His ghost is constantly advertising different products, including [[Chipotlaway]]. In the episode "[[Dead Celebrities]]", [[Eric Cartman]] appeared to be very passionate about his commercials and products.

The other dead celebrities on the purgatory plane were constantly annoyed by the passionate selling of his products, even though he was dead. After [[Michael Jackson]] accepted his death, he and the other passengers expressed their dismay as the purgatory plane went to its designated location: [[Hell]]. Billy now resides in Hell and is unlikely to return again.
