{{LinkDisambig|Michael (Disambiguation)}}
'''Michael Joseph Jackson''' was an American singer who made his first appearance in "[[The Jeffersons]]", where he was referred to as '''Martin Jefferson'''. After his death in 2009, he made three more appearances: in "[[Dead Celebrities]]", which mainly focuses on his and other celebrities' deaths; in "[[200]]", where he is seen among the crowd of celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]; and in "[[REHASH|#REHASH]]", as a hologram. Michael also appears as a boss in the ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' DLC ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' under the name "Corey Haim".

In real-life, Michael Jackson was a famous singer, dancer, and songwriter. He was most notable for being a dominant figure in popular music with songs like "Billie Jean", "Beat It", "Thriller", and many others. However, Jackson was also infamously known for being accused of pedophilia and being charged with child molestation crimes in the 1990s and 2000s. ''South Park'' mocks Jackson for these charges, as well as his childlike persona and addiction to plastic surgery. 

==Background==
In "[[The Jeffersons]]", after years of being targeted by the police, Jackson moves to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] into what is said to be "The Donovans' Old Residence" with his son, [[Blanket Jackson]]. Michael hopes that he can escape the police's constant attempts at framing him for child molestation. When Blanket makes friends with [[the boys]], Jackson quickly steals them for himself, in his continued attempts at regaining his lost childhood, often at the neglect of his own son. Jackson is quickly targeted by the [[Park County Police Force]], upon discovering that a rich black man had moved to town.

His new home in South Park is similar to his Neverland Ranch, as he has various expensive things including a cotton candy machine, arcade games, an amusement park, a train that children can ride, and even a small zoo in his backyard. He seems most fond however of his 'wishing tree' in which he climbs into and sings.

==Personality==
[[File:Jefferson (6).png||thumb|180px|Michael swinging with [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]].]]
Though talented, he is extremely childish, irresponsible, and delusional, playing with various children's toys, living in a fantasy world as well as neglecting his parental responsibilities in "[[The Jeffersons]]". He also saw no problem with sleeping in the same bed as young children that were not his children, despite the obvious inappropriate nature of such a situation. He also refused to accept his death in "[[Dead Celebrities]]", even going as far as to possess [[Ike Broflovski]] in order to participate in a little girls' talent show.

===Death===
In "[[Dead Celebrities]]", Michael refuses to accept his death, causing himself and other celebrities who died during [[Season Thirteen]] to be trapped in [[Purgatory]]. Michael Jackson then possessed [[Ike Broflovski]], so the boys had to help him live his dream of being a little white girl in order to banish his ghost from Ike's body. After Michael Jackson won a beauty pageant, in Ike's body, he accepted his death. He and the other celebrities were able to leave purgatory. Michael Jackson presumably now resides in [[Hell]]. He, however, was shown in the crowd of angry celebrities in "[[200]]". It is likely he returned to Earth, as people are able to return to Earth from Hell, as shown in "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]".

==Appearance==
[[File:Michael Jackson in Purgatory.png|thumb|left|150px|Michael Jackson at the end of "[[Dead Celebrities]]".]]
Michael has pale white skin (medium brown skin as a child, teenager, and young adult) and black hair. He wears a white t-shirt and red trousers. He also wears a white glove on his left hand. He has unique circle-shaped eyes instead of oval-shaped eyes that of a typical ''South Park'' character.

In the episode "[[The Jeffersons]]", he sports a fake mustache (so no one can realize that he is Michael Jackson). Towards the end of the episode, however, Jackson's appearance begins to become mutilated, as his face begins to fall apart and melt, causing him to become skeletal and zombie-like. He goes on to wear the red jumpsuit from his music video "Thriller."

At the end of "[[Dead Celebrities]]", he is shown wearing the formal outfit he wore during the 1984 Grammy Awards.

==''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''==
Michael appears in ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'', where he is known as "Corey Haim". Upon appearing from the portal conjured by [[Mr. Adams|Master Vampire Adams]], he proceeds to grab [[Karen McCormick|Karen]] and dive down the cliff waterfall inside [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]], forcing [[the New Kid]] to give chase by diving down the cliff as well.

Corey is then seen later at the ground-level dining floor after The New Kid emerges from the wishing well inside Casa Bonita, engaging The New Kid, [[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]], [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] and [[Mysterion]] into combat. After being defeated, he is then sucked back into the portal previously conjured by Master Vampire Adams, never to be seen again.
