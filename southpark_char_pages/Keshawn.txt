'''Keshawn''' is a successful pimp. He appears in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]" and in the videogame ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
In "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]" he is at the [[Players Ball|Player's Ball$ 2009]] talking to two prostitutes until [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] talks to him. Though he is surprised by what he sees, when he learns Butters has got four "bitches" in one week, he decides to give him some advice.

He later calls [[Harrison Yates]] who takes his persona as prostitute Yolanda too far and tells him he needs him as his ''Bottom Bitch''.

But when Harrison Yates wants to become Butter's ''bitch'' he appears in front of the [[Stotch Residence]] where he begs for "Yolanda" to come back to him, promising they will move to a [[Swiss Château|little château]] in [[Switzerland]]. At first, Yates refuses but when he proposes to him, he rushes and they make out on Butters' front lawn.

He is shown again in a remote château in the Swiss mountains. Inside he is shown on three photographs with Yates. He gives him a diamond necklace and tells him he wanted to give him something special, to which Yates replies: ''"Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the.."'' before he whips out his gun and badge and tells him he is busted.
