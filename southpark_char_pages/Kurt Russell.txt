'''Kurt Russell''' is an American actor, famous for films such as ''Big Trouble in Little China'', ''Escape from New York'', and ''Tombstone''. Russell appears in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", in which he was sent into [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]] due to him having "experience" in going through portals, as seen in the film ''Stargate''.

==Background==
After being sent back to Imaginationland in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", Russell wound up being gang-raped by the [[Woodland Critters]]. He also appeared in "[[Pee]]" as a firefighter, parodying his role in the movie ''Backdraft''. In "[[200]]" and "[[201]]", Kurt Russell is seen with all the other celebrities who sued South Park and extracted the goo from [[Muhammad]]. However, despite being involved with the destruction of South Park, he is shown once again as a firefighter, rescuing [[Millie Larsen]]'s cat.

==Appearance==
In "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]" he appeared in a U.S. military uniform: camouflage pants, shirt, black combat boots, black (presumably bulletproof) vest, and black kneepads. He also wore an earpiece/microphone on his right ear. In "[[Pee]]", and near the end "[[201]]", he appeared in the standard firefighter garb.
