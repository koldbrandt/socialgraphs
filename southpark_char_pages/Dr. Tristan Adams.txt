'''Dr. Tristan Adams''' is the owner of the [[Tantalus V. Observatory]]. He appears in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]" as the main antagonist.

==Background==
In "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]", Dr. Adams uses his "star machine" to hypnotize people into loving and volunteering for the planetarium.

He almost got away with it, but [[Eric Cartman]], pissed off, breaks the machine, resulting in Dr. Adams getting a full dose of the "stars". With no one to tell him what to do, his mind was erased. Due to a bone disease, he cannot pronounce the "t" in "planetarium".

==Appearance==
Dr. Adams has many wrinkles in his face and is balding. He wears the standard uniform at the planetarium: A black shirt with a light blue v-neck shirt with a dark cloud and sun on it.
