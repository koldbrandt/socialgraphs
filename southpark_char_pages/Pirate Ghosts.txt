The '''Pirate Ghosts''' also referred to as '''Ghost Pirates''', are the main antagonists of the [[Season Three]] episode "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]". 

==Background==
Pirate Ghosts are initially seen when t[[The 6th Graders|he 5th Graders]] ''(now 6th graders)'' try to scare [[The Boys]] on the South Park Docks.

They are then seen attacking the town at the [[City Hall]] and shooting off cannons from a ghost ship and decapitating people with their swords. By the end of the episode, [[Korn]] and The Boys set up a trap to capture the Pirate Ghosts. Afterward, it is revealed that [[Father Maxi]] had set up the Pirate Ghosts to scare everyone away from the docks because he didn't want there to be a Halloween. He used a flashlight and a few cotton swabs to create the Pirate Ghosts, a cup and a piece of cheese to create the sound effects, and some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels to create the ghost ship.

The Pirate Ghosts were also part of an ongoing argument on whether they were actually called Pirate Ghosts or Ghost Pirates.

==Appearance==
The Pirate Ghosts all wear typical pirate outfits such as peg legs and eye patches. They also wield swords and have a large ghost ship they use to shoot cannons. They all have a green color scheme and glow. Their overall design is also different from other South Park characters and is designed similar to how Korn is portrayed in the episode.
