==Background==
In "[[Unfulfilled]]", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] tells [[the boys]] that he will win the big prize at the bike parade and will finally beat Larry Zewiski. Larry arrives, mocking Butters, and then is accompanied by two Raisins girls, [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes]], which admire him and his bike. Larry continues to boast about how his bike is better, upsetting Butters, and leaves with the girls to show them his blue ribbons.

In "[[Bike Parade]]", Larry gets intimidated by Butters' bike and tells his [[Mr. Zewiski|father]], who was part of the [[Amazon]] workers' strike, to start working again, so he can have a better bike at the bike parade.
