This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.  Where did the Confederates go, son? Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.  Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.  Where are you going? We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!   No!

Dear. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah.

Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?!  I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me! Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?! YES I AM!! , I need help.  You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me. Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys! NAMBLA?

Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding, of course. KIIICK ASS! Oh,, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.

I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.  Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!  Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho. I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys.

Cartman,413," Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar. Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase. He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag., I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume.  Yeah, that's me. Yeahhh, you already know about it? Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your, Cartman!""  Here, Kyle.  And so the other thing that makes my cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and...? Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator. And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too. Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not,, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands. Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it. I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once. Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me. Okay, that's cool.

Is that what you want?! Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!   Hey, dudes. Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out. Why the hell not?! Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!  But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one. Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my! And you know what else?

Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!  Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!  Dude, we need your turkey for our play! I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy? I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it. Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh. Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything.  Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.

Let's just let walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all thes of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?   Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that. No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.  He said it was okay. Because  of! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!  Not like that, pony!  Whattayou mean? How do I do that? I see. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner... So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them. Whoa! I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. Radiohead. Yes, of course.   Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there! You're welcome, Scott.  Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?   That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?   Well, we would tour, but we just hate that kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. is totally not cool! He's not cool! Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it!   '""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""'   That does it! I'm gonna get once and for all!!! Hueah. You think you're so cool,? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! is going to wish he never met meee!!! , thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! How to get back! I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars.  It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans.'s favorite band is Radiohead, right? So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!  Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say is totally not cool! And that would make wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!  ...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!!   Hello, Scott! I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!  Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.  A little penis-biting, perhaps? Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good.   Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!  Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! What's so funny? Not yet, but they will be. Hey, Chef. What contest? Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here. !!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming!   Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.  Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!  Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine.  Alright.  Hey, this is great!   Gawh, this is really good, Scott! What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?  Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends,, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents.  I came just in time to see giving his report to. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Chili.""  Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!   Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet. Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks!

Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it. Gentlemen, I thank you.  Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa!

Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I,, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you,.  Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.  What the hell? You sons of bitches!   What the hell are you doing?!  That's right! You stay out! ...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially, you are to shoot on sight! Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.  But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line. Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines. But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park. Ugh... Two people? Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park... Sweet.  Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day.  I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in. The rest of you will just have to try another day. 'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. ...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing? Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?  Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security! Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it. But I don't know how it works. Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.  Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go.   Wait a minute! Who are you? HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan! I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY! Get him out of here!  Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....  ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!   Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me!  AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!  Hey, there you are!  Just give me my money back. I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park! You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit! GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!  Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!   Yeah? He-hey, that's my money! What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time! Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit! No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back. But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything! This can't be happening! AGGGHH!! It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair!

But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh?

Better. Better. Better. Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes. Mint condition, tax free. Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle! Stem cells, numbnuts!  It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest. Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own! Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.  Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.  Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.  I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?  Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?  You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch. ...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!  Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit!  Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.: Yes, hello, is this's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back.  Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.

Next number to try is on the list. What is this, a PTA meeting?   In the ...hospital? Why?  Die? Kenny? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat.  We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter. Heh, sorry.   ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know. Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!   Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy?  ' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man. I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure. Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work? Not at all, but go on.  My God... So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue. Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat! Hmmm. Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.  There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves. Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks.  Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.  My name is and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song  It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes I never meant to be so bad to you One thing I said that I would never do And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs. Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.  Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus?  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life. Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance. You guys! Come quick!  It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys!  Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked!  Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!

Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.  That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you. Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done. Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt? I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid! That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off. Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be! He used to be fat but not no more   and a lifetime of free food at City Wok. Uuuh, school project. Damnit Butters!

You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!  Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.  Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!  Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business. Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several. I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars. Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea. Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap! No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt! Check. That should blah  ah- here.  Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! Alrighty. Alright, I think it's in.   Bohogh, egh.  There it goes.  Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.  Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good. Oh, whoa. Whoa!  Oh, crap! Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are! Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.

Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay? Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to? All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!  Next? Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody. Alrighty then.  Uh, what's the question again? Five times one is of course... Five.  Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!  Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much.  All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle? Just one more rose, Kyle. All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!  Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!  The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates.  Next please. If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained? Very nice.  You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap! All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!  Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron? I think Towelie is awesome. Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered. Token's a smartass. Yeah. Do we really need another one?  Oh, thanks Jimmy. Alright Jimmy, see ya.  Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.  Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? ","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.71, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.9992}",0.066,0.71,0.224,0.9992,606,6
Cartman,607," You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it!  Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all! No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room! Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff. Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.  Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow! If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person! Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...  Look at me, livin' free Free and clean amongst the Sea People  We look for pirates and search for gold. Life is an adventure with the Sea People  They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat. They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.  This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,  Sea people and me. Sea people and me, you guys. Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies.  Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?  Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go.  What the fuck is this?!  I got RIPPED OFF!   Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.  Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!  Heheh, okay, okay. Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!  Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up! Tweek! Where are you going? In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one. We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves. Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.  Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word! Is it her? Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm... No, just a bunch of goo. There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands.   It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium! Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too. G'night, guys.  Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal.   H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it! Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK!  I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety. That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them thrive. Tweek! You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat!, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in. Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men. Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men? Do you have them or not? What's your name? Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound?   I see, very interesting.  Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five. No, gallons. Dammit! Give me all you've got, then!   That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek? And I've got the sea men.  Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley. Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go.  Nothin' to do now but wait. Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah. Oh my God!

Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea. I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.

Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer? That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since. Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.   God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh? Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way. Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks? Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop. Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.  Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents. Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house. Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom. Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice. Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school. The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office. Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place. And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.  What? Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches. Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog. Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?  Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it? I am a professional, suh!  Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied. Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! ic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop! ¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba! Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado. Marrado. Spectacularrr. God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far? Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice. Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! ¡No come la taco la trabajar! Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off. Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ¡Vamonos! Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby. Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become. Who the hell are you?  Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful! Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.713, 'pos': 0.188, 'compound': 0.9985}",0.099,0.713,0.188,0.9985,616,6

Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.

You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.  Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle. Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack. Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.  Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle. Why not? He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.

Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle? And you feel like you have to confess. I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.  Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.  Won't be long, Kyle.  I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours. They did? But can I still kill Kyyyle? Uh, can we see them-him-her? What are you talking about? This is a gift from God.

If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say. I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""

It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!  It worked for Creed!  You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius! Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!

Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives. We are going to start... a Christian rock band. Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-  Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you. All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.  Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!  All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.  I need you in my life, Jesus. I can't live without you, Jesus And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus. Almost there, you guys. Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.  I'm going to kill you one day, Token. Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.  No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!  No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! Token, look away to the right.  More.  More! So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go. My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door. I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.  Oh hey guys. How's it going?  I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. That's right.

The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta!  Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..  I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.  Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage!  Who are you? Yeah, you guys are real hardcore. Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.  Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.

I want you to walk with me  I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby! You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right? What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby! Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh! I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by! Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. Yes, we sure do.  Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ?? Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone. Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday. I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face! The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned! The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own! You're one time, two times, three times my Savior... Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot... Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!

And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. Yeah!

I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me.

Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!  Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?  Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!  Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!   All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.  I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind.   Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later.  Yes?  Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it.

I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.  Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!  Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!  The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.  No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.  Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.  Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita.  What what what? UUuuugh!!   Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.  Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!  We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!  Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack?  Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die!   The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!  Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass! We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.  ""Pretty cool.""

Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning.  Dr. Shafley? So if we make Butters up to look like a dog... Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.  Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. In here!  No way, you got weapons too?! Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!  We're twice the ninjas you fags are! Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa! Butters! Ye-yeah, a little- Butters!

Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove wrong, Kyle.  Do it.  All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.

Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000""  So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks! It's flawless!

I thought you always said I was special. ...I'll split the money with you.   All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change? Awesome.  Naaaa! Daaaaa! Naaaa! Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! ...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa! Enter.  Go on, Kyle. Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see's film, The Passion of the Jew. Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul. Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck.  One thousand dollars, yeah!  Daaaa! Daaaa! Whoa. What the hell??  Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.  God-damnit! All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards!  God-damnit! Ah, screw you hippies! ...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!  Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.

You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.  Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.

It has made people the world over open their eyes. If I knew where was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.

Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done. But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.   Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion. Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean. One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""

Cartman,902,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.  Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic? Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies.  These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.  Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.  Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit!  God damn hippie!  Get out of here! Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse! The college know-it-all hippies.  All right, in you go. Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!  What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why! Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it. And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar!  Please, I have to talk to you all right now! Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over! I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival. It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.  I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. ' What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger!  I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement!  Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?! Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you.  Everybody get in a single-file line! Ah,, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted. What? You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them! No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!  What did I do?! They're not people, they're HIPPIES!  Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!  You... You what? They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?! You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!   How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies!  Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.  Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.  Forget it.  It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!  Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot. Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!  All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick. In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all. We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside. Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about-  There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got. I... don't want you to worry about me,.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had.  Primary engine running? Navigation systems? Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status? Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that? Come on, come on! No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there! ...All right, fine Chef, go! Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line!  You're the scientist, jackass! Put them in my laptop!  Hold it right there, Kyle!  Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle. Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, sorry!

I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. What do you mean? I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!   Tell her, tell her that I love her.  Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!  It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! Just the good times. I can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!  All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black.  Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and. That's everyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.  Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.  G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!!  Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? What else do I have to do?! Atone?  Not really... Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. Really? I know how. Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right. Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny?  Stupid butthole God!  Butters. Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! She's gonna close soon! Come on!  Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! I told you, Butters.  Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages. Don't worry. I have a plan.  They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.  Yes, it's working!  Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.  Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters!

What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future. Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children. Video playback initialized.  Believe it. can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.  How is the incubation shield coming Clyde? Good man.  Any luck here? Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here. Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over? Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it. No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town. No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that! Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.  Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet.  Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters.  Okay. One! Two!  Nice. Dude, I think it's totally working. are totally buying it.   Dude, they totally think he's a girl.   Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly.  Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it. Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.  God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it. That son of a bitch! Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!

Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future.  No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions. Because I do, Clyde. I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty? Will you all shut up so I can do this!? Are you guys nuts?!

Cartman,911," Thank you,.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls. Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires. I was getting to that, if you will let me.  have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" , I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions. Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again.  Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA!  -ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille Four hungry children and a- I'M GINGER! Help me! Hellp mee! And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this! So I'm gonna stay like this forever? Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?! Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys? Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency. Actually, gingervitus is the medical term. Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal. What do you mean, Kyle?  Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle.  That's fine, just get it out of the way...  Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim?  I'm grubbin'. What's it look like? Huh? But... it's me. Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.  I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap! Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are! ...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike... Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand... Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride! Red Power!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Better red than dead! Better red than dead! That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized! The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do! There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!  Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power? Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is! Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are!  We're fine, thanks. We're fine! You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them! Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?! My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us!  What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!  No, we're fine! Thank you! Yes! We're good! You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker! Go on then! Say your last words! Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what?   Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become? D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together. Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like. See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live.  ... Huh? Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated. No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along. Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same. Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys! Hand in hand, we can live together.

You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?! That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?! I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong!  Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't., that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy? What? Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war! You guys, this is serious! We have to do something! We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me? Then we'll ride our Big Wheels. If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! Guy writers aren't gonna back down! Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle? All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right.  Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work.   Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me.   Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time. You know we might not even make it into the studio. So what made you change your mind? Well Kyle, we'd better get going. Are you set? All right, let's roll!  Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever. It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley. Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.  Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand!  Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!  Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw? Kyle, stop it! Holy Crap!  Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!  Suck mah balls, Kyle!

Cartman,1004,"I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Kyle, stop it! So long, Kyle! Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away. It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG! Dude, can I go before you? So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh? So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want. ...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism. This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this. Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him. Seeya.  Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow... You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow.. I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.  Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.  I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening.  It won't take long, sir.  Ow...  Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.  Wha?  What are they? Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now. Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk! Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you- Why not?  Son of a bitch.  Well well well!  Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well. You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy. Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in. Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.  Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge. I did it. I... AM... GOD!!! Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?! You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!  I can't let you do that!  Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!  Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out!

I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out. She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom. Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face. Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?! Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face. Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself! You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother.   No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want! She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being. Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...  Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me.  Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham. Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started. Tha... thank you? 'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.  I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now.  No, that's okay. Besides, I told we could work on our science project then.

Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft. I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too? That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars. There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow. Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys?

But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane? So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle! Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle!

Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right? Here, you need a smoke, brah? You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah. Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah.  Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright? Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool. What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee. Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg. Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with. They what??  Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg! Hall infraction!  You got a hall pass, brah?! Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?! Get down on the floor!  You like bear mace, icehead?! You're goin' with Christ!  ...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person. Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass. I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her. You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch! You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean.  Oh no! I don't believe it. She's using the defense. There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?! No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.

It's an awesome idea All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right? All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.

All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go.  Uh!  Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!  I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!  That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay!

I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha!  Where is it, you filthy Jew?!  You know God damned well what! I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!  Give it back, Kyle! I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here. You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!

It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth. No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture! Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep. I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell! That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!  I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow! Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee. Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.  Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have. But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay!   But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee!  You, you will? It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you!   What? Mom, she's lying! Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!  Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh. Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction! HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps? And now this next picture  And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial.  Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft. What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong!

Cartman,1103,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it. Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.  They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls.  This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home. Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened? Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right? Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?  That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast! All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you!  Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself! Me?! I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me! That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.  And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing!  There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!  All right, lock that door, Craig!  I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.  This is a scientific test, designed to- I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?! If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice! Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you. All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know.  Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean.  It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH!  Kenny! Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice!  He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park!  What, Clyde? All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?! Guilty! I thought so!  All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!  Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?! Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?! But that means... that means Kenny was lying!

LALALALALALA!, this is! Are we on a secure line? Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now! Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid! Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address? Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready? It's my balls!   Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.  Yeah?  Yes,hompson? Why? Did you find something?  A snuke?  I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you? Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.  Big surprise! Let me have time with him. We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!  Where is the detonator?!  I can do this aaall day. You can make it stop! Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!  Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts.  Where is your son?! Answer it!  Butters. We got him! I know where he is! No no, he's my lead.  You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!  Uuugh!   Where is the detonator! You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One! Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you!  Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore. Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy! That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading. Uhh yes, of course? The Russians? The Germans? The Germans again? You can't possible mean...? Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology. Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool. But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America. Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?! Yes or no, Kyle?! But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?  Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.","{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.729, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': -0.9171}",0.139,0.729,0.132,-0.9171,1104,11

Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition. ...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble. Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle. Good morning,. Asspussy!  Dicktits! Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me.  Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness. Tampon! Tampon DICKshit! Kyle, don't you think I wish I could?

Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome?   Dear Mr. Hansen, I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!!   Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf!  Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!  Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.  Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?  Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy. Then the game is on, Kyle.  Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night.""  Uhh nuh-nothing... Hm. That was... weird.  Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles.  And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on? No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson!   Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom!   Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say? Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah!  I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!  Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!  No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.  Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye!   Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show. My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine. No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.  But I'm not gonna do the- I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show? You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye.  Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!  No, I'm just gonna go-   How does he do that?. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle. Kyle? Kyle, what are you doing? Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle! I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man! You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle!

When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls. Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good? Bail, bail!  Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls. Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time"". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground. Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention!  We got it! We got it!

If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any goddamned second, Kyle! , can you believe that asshole?! Ironic how?  Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!  Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!  All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up.  Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at. Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do. I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.  All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access. Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole.  Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?! Kyle, what?! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it? Nothing! Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.  Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p- Kyle! Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!  Kind of.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle. See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.   Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going? What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!! Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not! Leave alone!  NO!!  AHH!!! you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you! No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope. Break my Xbox and you'll never know. NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson. He was a basketball player. So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!  My God... We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS. Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!  Oh uh, you know, all over cancer. Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease. No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.  I know. I'm scared too. We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Kyle, we need to try to find a-  I don't think it's funny, Kyle.  Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-  Are you sure?  Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk. All right!  What?! Aw, no! What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha. What? No. No.  Kyle, no!","{'neg': 0.137, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': -0.9868}",0.137,0.765,0.099,-0.9868,1201,12

How much will you pay me? Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks. Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test. Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk? Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around. Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.  Hello students. I'mez.  Your new teacher. I am here... to teach you calculuuus. Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu. Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top. No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy. Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds? Nice form, compadre.  Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us?   Okay, you start on defense, amigo.  Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo! What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo.  Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.  Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds? Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can-  Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me. Good. Again. Again! Now you sound like white people! The answer to #27 is 5. The answer to #28 is 14. All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?  How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion. Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you? Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life. Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest. Uh what? Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them. How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives. You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.  I reeached these keeeds.","{'neg': 0.13, 'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': -0.9301}",0.13,0.726,0.144,-0.9301,1205,12

Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village. Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.  Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us. They must have realized we left. Damn.  Shhh! Butters! Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this! Butters, l-listen to me, listen. All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along. If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand. Butters? All right, come on!  Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free. Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good. It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP. Save me! ... Oh dude, laaame. Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag.

Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.  What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight. Why not? You chicken?  Pfffft.

My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary.  What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?  Wendy, Wendy. Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard! Butters, get out of here!  ...Huh?   What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you. Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time. Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully!   You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.

Cartman,1302," The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact.  Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon. I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.  You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you! He's not a fag!  Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon,? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.  Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.  Hunh! I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices! I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!  Wha, what?  What?! Fuckin' butthole! You gotta be kidding me!

Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke. Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated. Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us!   Motherfucker! Jimmy, dude, did you see?! is taking credit for our joke! Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me! But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do! What?! Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember? Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out? Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together. Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow!  Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew. It's cool man, it's cool.  Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?  It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it.  You do?  But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I? Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg? That's cool. You wanna write some together?   Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks. Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?"" So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?"" It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all!  Thanks you guys! Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over. Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you. Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you. Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important.  Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia. Uhhh excuse me?  Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials. Yeah, that was kewl huh? Whassat? So... here it is. That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's! Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself! Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?! Hello Jim.  What are you up to? Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up.  Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy. Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?""  Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off!  Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There!  Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it. You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault. Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now. All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things. I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise.

I was pregnant with your child and aborted it.  Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them. I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?!  Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay? Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.  You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing! We just received a letter from the WWE. ""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."" Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before. Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler. Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking. And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again. Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy. Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen! Right? No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances. Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it! Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys. It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts. Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go! Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go! Thank you.  Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself? Yeah, this guy crushes.  Alright, places everyone.  Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown.  My man can do whatever he wants. You're just gonna have to deal with that. My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic. Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now! You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong! O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky! Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico! Hey, what about us? Our show?

And I, am. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president,!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners. But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions! You wanted to see me,? Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once! Oh really?! Then how come got to go on for like five minutes that one day?! You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it? I am not, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed! Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting! Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school. - of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one would have, a socialist dunghole - Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video. Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no,'s not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs. I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something. ""Thank you"" and this is to..?  ""To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy. Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school. Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book. That'll be five dollars. A book signing. I do not directly say she's a slut!  You didn't read the rest, dude. ""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it! You wanted to see me again,? Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about? And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?! Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey! Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back!  Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own.  The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion. Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland. And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool? Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy. People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning. Of course. That's why we're here. Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary,. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show. Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it. How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth?  You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth. Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now? If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream?  You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting? Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what? What? What do you mean I know that? No! You wiped them all out! Wait, hold on, can we take a break? Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing- No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours! You sold the movie rights to who?! Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!  Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else!  Huh! No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader! I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded!  I'm doin' the best I can!

There are actually more minorities here than us! ...What do you mean? The black and brown people. Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year! Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this! The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening! You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy? Help! Help! Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh.  Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.  Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor.

I read the whole fucking thing!

I just read a book! For nothing!"" They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity!  We know, we were just saying that. It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene! Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one. The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass. It was a... a warm spring morning.

If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned. Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed. Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.  Ms. Jessica Parker, over here.  See any hunters yet? Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there. So what? Oh dude, sweet!  People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter! What?! Oh come on! Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters. That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.  You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit.

Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.  Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend,'s stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle! You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him. Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip. It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette? Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette. Uh huh.

Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What? What, Kyle? I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top.  Yeah, it's pretty good. Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?! Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead!  There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!

Oh, Goddamnit! Let me guess: I'm in trouble again! For what?! Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?! I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS! You're damn right! One point two inches!

What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well. Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you! Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second! What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?! We made a thousand dollars in eleven days.  Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack. Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time. After you.  Come on.  We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day. It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials. Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert. We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights. You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free.  Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you. Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. ? We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again? We need to speak with you, ma'am.  And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?  Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association.  We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?  Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's. Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules. I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the- Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters?  It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!  Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go! , how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat., can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks,. Bye.  How's it goin', man? They can't make money. It's against the rules. Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing. What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?! We're a non-profit company, Kyle. Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look.  It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it.  Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy. A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutine"". It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.  Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman.

Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then? I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right? But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves. You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home!  How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal! How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?! Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address! Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime! !  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn! ...What? Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle! This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public.

His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit.  Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope? Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us. Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip. Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me! Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl. I know,, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault. What do you mean,? Thanks. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back. What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you!  Mom, have you been here all day?! Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?! Am I sure?? Look at this place!  Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-  Oh my God. ! No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took!  ! Clyde!??!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG!  I've known since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just- Got something to say Kyle?!  How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please.

What are you doing with your time?! Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!  We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear! Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps! IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!!

Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.  Yeah, yeah. That's right. Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?! Well I'll tell you somethin'!

Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!  Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell. Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing. I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence? Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.  Butters. Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera. Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real. Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in. Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here. You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere. JESUS IS A LIE! Shh! Help me call it out, Butters. Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST! No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters? Sh! You hear that? I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us. It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that had died for our sins. I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath.  We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here.  That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank. Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe!  Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it. People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little. These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid! I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra. It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy. Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified. Heh. What do you mean?  Well, I mean it could have just been a dog? Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive. Why? There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle? Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle?

This isn't safe or fun! NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!  Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance. Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble. It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do!  Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha-   Ugh... what... where... Ugh... what?  What's going on? It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs? So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle. Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind. What does that mean? Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no? You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick!  Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs? But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave. Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that.  But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys. I love you, dad. And our love grows Have no fear, for God is near And God loves all his children  Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing? No, Kyle! I don't believe you! Noooo!  Noooooo!  Noooo!  No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh!  We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!   No! No! The bread is all flat! No!  I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah, I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ. Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe. I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying. Kewl, thanks Kyle.

It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you. Please, Kyle. It's kind of important. You happy with the election results last night, Kyle? Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?  What if I did, Kyle? Pretty sweet, huh? What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states. No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.  Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard.   Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate.  Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone. Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan. Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.  Hmmm, no. I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission. Ey! You can't do that! Ey! I know my rights! Stop right now!  I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing. But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.  Mm, mhm, mhm. They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit. Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it? Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted. So here's the deal,,, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of's son. Cartman Skywalker. Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken,.  Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters? I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you. Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists. Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese! Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever! I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that! I want a part in the new movies! I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca. Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun. Haha. Haha.   I don't think so,! This way, officers!  Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle? No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!

Cartman,1701," Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life. Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"" Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?  Kyle, this is a private conversation. Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls. Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails? Who is that? Is that Toby? Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's? You're what? What, you say? I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""? See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally!  That'd be what? I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too? Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something? Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro? Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms.  Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle?  Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally. Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core! Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter. No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter. What, they already have something better than Twitter? No! What commercial?     Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy. Just two so far: me and.   Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?. Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me. I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.  I was um, sure that the appointment was today. Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.   Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with? Really? How big is my file? Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time. Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change's status! Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! is the NSA's worst nightmare! The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!  Can't do anything?? You're the NSA! I don't know. Get their hands on what?  Dude...  You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on's new television show, via Shitter!  You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!  It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine! Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?!  It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa!  I do toooo! Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon. ...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?  It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs. What's this? I can be forgiven? For everything bad I've ever done? And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?  Thta's pretty kewl.

This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me. I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet.""  I was not the bullet. I was not the gun. I was not the juror that set the shooter free. I was not the trigger. I was not the hate. Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me? I was not the black family mourning for the dead. ""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"" I was not the verdict. It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on. I was not the shooter. I was not the gun. So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.  Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here. It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.

Oh my God, we still have time! It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet. His name is Token. I won't do it! He used to be my friend!  Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world. We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!  Come on!  Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance. A person.  Threatening all of us! What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?! Stand my ground? Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!  This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida? The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot. We have to get to Florida! Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go! Find the closest airport in Florida!  If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman. Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out.  I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.

I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle. I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.  Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it? There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow.   You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again! Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature!  What? What joke? This is real! No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong. Thank you, Butters!  Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good. Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh.   Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."" I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles.  Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute? I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up. I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.  No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle! But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie. You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it!   Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say?? Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?  Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle.   Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle?  Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...? You what??  Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here. Let's see. Oh! Oh!   Oh,, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?  Kyle, are you sure? Well alright.  Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek? I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai? You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle?  Huh? You comin'?  Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow.  Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy? Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip. Small penis?! No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems. No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.

I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it. Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves. What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system. I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday. It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole! On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.  Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.  They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters. Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight! But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid? Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them. Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it? What do you mean? Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters. We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us!  That's what this is all about, Craig.

We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final! Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!  Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!  Come on, Kyle.

Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?  Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap. The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle? You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.  Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners. What new Elmo doll? Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle. I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us. True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.

Do we understand each other? Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros! Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right? Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay?

Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones? Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you? So what happens when the dragons show up? Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny. Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir and go seek out for answers. He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.  Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!

It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded? That could be up to you. Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security? Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors. Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops! Yeah! Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then! Hi, is Kenny home? Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me.  I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick? You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday. Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess! That doesn't even make sense. You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!  Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday. Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules. Your CEOs? Uhhh, hmmm. What? Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9875}",0.086,0.785,0.129,0.9875,1708,17

Don't seriously tell to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit.  He's not a princess, he's a DUDE! So what are you saying, Kyle?! Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay? Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess. We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.  Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King. Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding. I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors.  Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by. Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through- Dude! Dude! Dude, shut the fuck up! He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time. God damn it, shut up! Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?! Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.  Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole! I'll shit in your fuckin' garden! Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there? Oh uum, aaand Beyoncé. Yesh, kewl. Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying at Red Robin if she was. Has anyone heard from Butters and? The fuck are they? Yes, he did.  It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again. What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle! Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs. Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out? Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit. Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde? What the hell is this?! Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?! Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it! Oho!! Sweet! In your face, Kyle! They're not a part of your betrayal? No. Whose betrayal is this?  Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.  Yay, XBox wins. We'd like to get XBox Ones please. The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface. You guys wanna p-play outside or something?  I just... I can't get the image of... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes. The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play? Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude!

Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated! You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it! It's the greatest startup company name EVER!  Washington. Redskins.  It's sooo sweet! It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo! Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable! Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!  It's a strong name, dude. It's like aggressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken. We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down. I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention! Sittin' on our asses, here we come!  By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge. Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our Kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye. Yes, I know. Oh, cool. Please take a seat. Nice, I like that. Stop? But why? Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that? How is it offensive? Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.  Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself.  Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid! Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk! Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys! NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator! It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters. Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man! Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!"" Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle? Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too? Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye.  Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins!  Goooood morning, guys! We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!  What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth! What?! Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle! You son of a bitch! You broke Kickstarter! Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be! Well, somebody did!  A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything!   It is really sweet. Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it. You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.  I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch.  Whoa, whoa! What?

Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I'm really a girl. That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws. Erica.

Now get back to the access point. Yeah, Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright, Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.  Uh, Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now. Butters, it's, uhh, time to stop. Get back to my place. Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now? Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay? Wait, hang on Butters! Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing! Butters?? Butters??  Butters.  Are you okay? I'm not here, Butters. This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real. Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.  You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam.  Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.  How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door?  Butters. I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!  I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello? With what?  Fuck you! Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality. Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.  Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now. Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!  Are you fucking with me?! Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?! Because if you are, it's not cool! Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality! Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program! That's right! THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life? Well if you get grounded in virtual reality, you get grounded in real life too... FOREVER!  It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.  I know. Let's go to the backyard.  Okay Kyle. Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?  Mmmhmm. And why did the guys send you, Kyle? Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on. I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle. Calm down. In virtual reality, yes you did. You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!  Fuck! Or if I did? What?  Hello? Dude. NOW this is getting weird!  No, you guys. This is virtual reality. Because... I'm a computer program. I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real. I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service. You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!

We forfeit! Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack. Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health. Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer. Ah, dude, your dad's here. It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.

In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away. It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!  Oh my God they're so gay you guys. Ah, no, we're good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!  Yeah, I'm sure they are.  That's pretty cool. Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.  Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him. Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters. I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things. Yes I do, Butters.  Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool. Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad! Oh my God! I never said it was gay! That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?!  He's a lying, backstabbing Jew! So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember? And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember? No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters. Whoa, dude. They're fuckin' ninjas, dude! Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something? Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic? YES!  YEEES!  Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys? You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this.  It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja.  Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.  Who, who is this? ...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage. Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle. No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please! I told you guys. What did I tell you?

Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground. What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor. They're pretty related. Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon. It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon. They can live without us. We can't live without them. If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon-- Elon? What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars. If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.  Is that Kyle?  Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now. Attention all SpaceX employees.

If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!  Oh hey baby, what's going on?  Yep, I'll be there I decided to give her one more chance. She is mentally abusive. Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There.

""Please, Heidi, please!""  Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!  That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny!  I don't think kids at this school take  suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness! Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.  Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny!  You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it.  I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad, Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad. I can't go on. What is livin' for? My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!""

But Eric, we don't want you to die. You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.  Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand. With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter. My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her. I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow. Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.  But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.  Everybody!  Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric. But it's so hard! Eric, we don't want you to die Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously! Eric, please don't die  Distracted driving my asshole.   Well, how nice. That's a little more like it.  Well guys, what happened? Change of heart? What?? Is he dead? Oh, that son of a bitch!  I'm gonna talk to the principal!  Put down that candle, Kenny!  Like you ever gave a shit about! , I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this ""don't be on your phone when driving"" crap! Yes, but is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying! I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!  Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets! Maybe I will! Maybe I will!!  Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke. Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it. They want to get help? For what? No, this is about me killing myself. They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?! So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?! No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority!  Oh, are you freaking serious?!  Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have? Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody. They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve? You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi! So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now!   Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation Or I will rip my own guts out without one hesitation  Dedication, that's what it's taken to awaken people to care  And yet my future's so hazy, my girlfriend's makin' me crazy But still I'm workin' so hard. You know, just tryin' to hold on,  'Cause I know that you don't miss me so much if I was gone.  And all the voices start solo, but every day I hear them grow. Sayiin' ""Eric, don't do it!

Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?  What? What? What the hell was that? Yeah, get meaner, Kenny. Just talk about cutting off his dick or something. Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick. Guys, what are you going? I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way- Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said ""Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"" And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said ""No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!"", he said ""No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!"" You guys can all give up, but I'm not. Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl. With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October.

Cartman,2104," Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think? Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money. Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito. That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole. Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all-  Onscreen! What is it, Super Craig? Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way? Butters?! Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise? If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys. Wilson Aubrey? It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram? That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein. But it's NOT true.  Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself! God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise! Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now. Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself! Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together!  And we'll-!  Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?  Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now? Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!  Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix. We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three. Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited. It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends. Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook! Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE! It's a lot harder than you think! Butters! Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Token doesn't poop in girls' mouths! When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix. We're gonna beat him at his own game.  Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children!  This one, simply protesting for black lives!  And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people! And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!  Ever heard of Facebook Live?  We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg.  Facebook says it's true. It's over, Chaos!  We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device! Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan.  You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we- You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie , after your video game. Not everyone gets their own movie! Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet! Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?! Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house! Go ahead!

Cartman,2201,"Oh, man! Wait, wait, Token got an A? But I cheated off Token! I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Token! You can see where Token erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose!  That is such bullshit, you guys! Token knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?! That's not the point, you guys! Why is Token out to get me? There's something going on here. But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Token. Why did he choose now to hurt me? Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass? Token,  There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist.  Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther?? But I thought all of you saw it.  Token, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades? There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Token did things to make me fail, and it's not fair. You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right. I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.  Butters.  Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite. No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Token so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther. No it wasn't. But now listen.  There's got to be something Token wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage. Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Token, give me a call.  This world is full of two types of people:  the ones who are honest, and the ones who don't play by the rules.  Token's got everyone believing he's the one African-American in the entire country who didn't see Black Panther. What else is he lying about?   Nichole, can I talk to ya?  Word on the street is you and Token are back together. Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?  He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung. Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say? Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Token? What's he have on you?  $1.3 billion domestic box office, a milestone for African Americans,  and I'm supposed to believe that Token and his little sex kitten never even talked about it.  The all-school test is in less than 72 hours. Unless there's a connection, I'll be grounded from Fortnite for weeks.  Hello, Mom and Dad. Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original. So, uh, what was Token's favorite part of Black Panther? Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Token say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night?  Token. Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther. Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks.  Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off. No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther.  I'll see you at school. Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you? You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Token. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations. So, what's it gonna be, Token? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore. Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report. In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Token is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink. Token, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them! Of course you did, Token! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much! But Token, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat-  Oh my God. You don't care what I said because you did see it... and you... didn't like it either.  That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Token! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test. What? No!  We have to take that test, Token!  Come on! We can still get to class on time!  Oh, great! Come on, we can do this!  Billy, give me your lunchbox!  Butters! Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting! I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!  Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tokens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them? What do you mean?  I mean, in a school of 200 students, there's already two who are covering up the truth. All Token is doing by letting you cheat off him is keeping the whole thing quiet even longer.  There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.9991}",0.167,0.753,0.08,-0.9991,2201,22

He didn't believe me, so I said ""Oh, I already did it to Kyle."" Stan heard that, so he got pissed off and had me sent off to a migrant detention center. I know. I know it sucks. But we're stuck in here together. Come on, buys. All we have to do is try to make the most of it.  Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin'? Don't it seem like there's never any light? Santa never comes for me. no está aquí.   Aw, come on, Kyle. I know it's no fun to be in here, but you can't think about yourself. Think about the greater good.  Now, when you don't like people, you can have then taken from their families and put into camps. Why does that make you  Ohhh my God. Ohhh Jesus, Kyle. I've totally forgotten you're a... Of course, you're extra sensitive to this stuff. Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.  Oh, my God, Kyle. I didn't even make the connection, you know? I was just like, Oh, I'm gonna have Kyle thrown into a detention camp. That'll be sweet,"" and I didn't stop to think that... for you guys... it's not that sweet.

What kids would care at all that-  the girls! The fucking girls!  Excuse me?! Can someone explain to us why this  is on our lunch trays?! Oh my God. I'm about to lose my mind.  You think you can just mess with a man's lunch?! You think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?! You dictate what foods I can eat?!  Urgh  I can't, I can't. Butters, I can't.  Agh. Fuck you, Wendy. Hey guys. How's it goin'? Yes. tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls' protest ruin our lunch ever again! Well, their protesting is ruining my lunch! Yes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF! They're trying to take people's lunch! They don't realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  Agagagh, my lunch!  Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM. Yeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It's a difficult choice.  AAAH! GAAAH!  CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?! We all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME! Some of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah!  Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters. I think this is the Big One! Don't let me die. Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Butters.  Agh. Fuck you, Wendy. .  What's goin' on, Butters? It's taco Tuesday.  These tacos look different. What kind are they? Oh, Incredible Beef tacos. That sounds nice.

That's what all the kids decided while I wasn't there? Me too. I need to have a word with the students at my school.  Hey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch. I found out about what we're eating here at the school. I found out what it's made of and where! What are you sorry about? It's me who owes all you guys an apology.  I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I've learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn't want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box.  I don't have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I'm fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn't matter!

We want to be pirates, or Vikings. You know what the girls think about? They think about red cubes versus blue cubes, and how much of this equals how many victory points. They're just doing math. NO!

It is tyrannous, and it is wrong. Dice Studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school. But that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness.  Yes, inclusion is wonderful, but we have to admit that boys and girls are simply different in some ways that can sometimes make competitions unfair. Have you ever seen how girls do their homework? They do it... that night, meticulously going over every detail and often finishing before they absolutely have to. This is how girls are with board game rule books. Before we even start playing, they've already strategized a way to win, leaving others in the dust. And now I'd like for you to hear from my friend Scott, who has diabetes.  Terminal diabetes.

You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we're more depressed than ever.  The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we're worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right? It's true! Women have ""periods"" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny ""Oh, what if the teacher got her period?"" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup  on the teacher's chair and when she stands up it's gonna totally look like she got her period!  It's going to be amazing, you guys. I'm so excited!  Shh! Kyle, Kyle! Shhh!  Oh, my God.  Teacher had her period.   That's nasty, teacher. Don't have your period during class time! You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we've ever done. Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face? Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic? Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever!  We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period! Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives. It's not gonna be hard. They'll bring in some lame ass teacher who's desperate to work. How bad can it be? Hey, broships. You ready for some substitute teacher action? This should be fun! Oh, dear Christ, what have we done? Wow, people are really pissed at us for doing the period joke, you guys. Well, because I told them we all did. People know we're bros and that we do everything together! That's right, Kyle, you did nothing. You knew about the prank, you could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't say a word. Silence is violence, Kyle. Oh, my God... Maybe our broship didn't survive.  And now you've made Kenny cry.  Hey, Kenny. Guys? Guys, come on. You agreed to counseling.  Hey,. We, uh, we've been having a lot of problems and um, we all want to work on our broship, don't we guys? You know this pandemic has been a pressure cooker, and we just feel like we're going through the brotions. You know? Silence is violence, Kyle. Silence is violence. How do we do that?  Oh, hey, hi. We're with the nonprofit service Kids for Kommunity. Both spelled with a K. Yeah bros! Kommunity Kidz spelled with a K. Gets 'em every time. You God damn old bitch! What?! This is becoming the most expensive period joke we ever did!  Oh, you fucking slut! This is why we keep old people in the back of the line!  Hi,, it's., we would like for you to come back to school tomorrow, because... we have COVID-19 vaccinations. And it was so uncalled for and so wrong. I mean, especially because we're guys. I mean, dudes sitting around coming up with period jokes, like, how old are we? Seriously? You are so important. Which is why it was so not funny what we did. I mean, what is funny about blood coming out of a woman's vagina? Like, it's sexist, first of all, and you know what else? It's just lazy. Just like dialing it in, that's what we were doing. We were just dialing it in. Hey, we will be there. Period.  Okay. Okay, cool. Bye.  Did you guys hear what I said? Relax, guys. She's gonna come. Wow, everyone just really wants a shot.   Oh, my God.  You guys, oh my God, seriously.  You guys know Mr. Lawson? Jenny Lawson's dad?  He's offering us 2,000 bucks for a vaccination. Dude, people really want their shot. I'm asking around to see what they're willing to pay for it. I'm a little Harvey Weinstein. Kyle, this is what our broship needs! We can sell these and go on vacations together, go to shows and theme parks! What's best for us is thousands of dollars. That's always what's best!  I don't know why you don't stand up to him more, it's really disappointing. I can't believe we're actually doing this. There are people out there who really need these vaccines -- who have cash. The fuck are you talking about, Scott? Lil' Qties? With a ""Q"" and an apostrophe after the ""L""? That's way better than Kommunity Kids, guys. I told you, we're getting lazy. Look, you guys have a right to say and believe whatever you want, okay? But what you believe is really stupid. Hi,! How are you? And, you know, we just ran into a little hiccup, so we wanted to see if you could meet us somewhere else for the vaccine. No, no,, it's not a prank! Okay, fine, we'll be there, okay? Just sit tight.  She's not gonna come meet us, Kyle! He what?! Alright, guys. I guess it's time we all had the talk we never wanted to have.  Kenny, you wanna go get on your iPad for a minute? We just -- we really need to talk for a second, Kenny. Look, I downloaded Madagascar 3. You wanna watch with your Troll headphones?  I've been trying as hard as I can to hold things together, but I have to admit... I'm just going through the ""brotions."" I think I have a plan. Alright, here's the situation --  All of our teachers are inside the school, surrounded now by at least 400 to 500 people who want a shot.  The Lil' Qties are stationed throughout and we...  And we are no longer bros. The magic is gone and we are through, is that right?  But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3.  Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend. Okay, so we can go alternating weeks --  Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate.  Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break.  Alternating weeks with midweek overnight.  3-3-4-4 rotation. Makes everyone's days consistent -- oh, hang on on a second, guys.  Everything okay, buddy? We're almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream?  Okay, you're doing great, pal.  The 3-3-4-4 is the most consistent, but to change weekends, we would need...  the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate.  The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don't have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life.  This isn't our fight anymore, Kyle. Alright... then let's get those vaccines to the teachers. Well, come on you guys! Let's get inside! Of course we made it!  'Cause our broship can survive anything! Yeah. Thanks. I'll be fine. I already have some new bros I'm hanging out with.  Yeah?  Casa Bonita?!

What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?  They're gonna say ""shit"" on television? Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage. It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip? It's stupid! No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV! Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else. How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!  I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid! I don't really give a fuck!  Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now! Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell? Oh, whatever.  This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.  It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!! There's no sand in my vagina!!! You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying! Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television. I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"". Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!  Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?  No no! The word, ""shit"". Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"". Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague. A... curse word. Cartman, this is serious!!! Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!  We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word! Cartman, stop being an asshole!  We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word.  It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny. ...No. Now what? We need some help identifying an ancient English stone. And asshole. Wait!  It's okay. The curse has been lifted.  You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems. We're all saying the S-word too much!  The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.","{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': -0.9801}",0.139,0.757,0.104,-0.9801,502,5

It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest. I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff. Crack baby... basketball. No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's? Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that?   Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault! I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya.  I need to talk to you.   In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies. But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that. Gut they're the ones risking injury. The government could come after us, Cartman. So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go? A hot tub?! Gravy? No way. I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal. What other companies? Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken! It happens to be called poutine in Montreal!   Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies. I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care! ...What? And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter? What? Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all! Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing. You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go! You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to! It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it! This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place? But who paid for all this?  You don't think that-? But he isn't real.","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.786, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.08,0.786,0.134,0.9958,1505,15

Fuck you! He said they're doing a Total Recall. You haven't done anything yet! We need help! Our friend is in a coma! Hey, Cartman, I need to talk to you. Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible. Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here. Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here. I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me. Www-what do you mean? Fuck you! Don't... do that! NO! I put your headset on, and came here to- No. Then I came into this virtual space. Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?! Yes. My name is. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there? Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?  Dude... What? Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality? Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then- Holy shit. Then this is all real.

Well? Oh my God! Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.   Dude, where's the money? What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega! Tell us what?! Dude.  You guys! You guys! I figured it out! Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right? So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it! The kid will never even know. We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!  Come on, Kyle!  Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""  There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it. This is the smartest business venture ever.  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?! ...Hey, you can't do that! Because that's what we're doing! You scram! We were here first! You woke him up!

Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.  If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?  Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same. That is our presentation. An idea that we call... Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second. Alright, where's Clyde. Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit! It's Cartman! All right! Let's do this! Come on!

You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel! You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago? If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass? Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.  Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.   And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word.  Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider.  The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.  So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die.  We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago. Yes. No foolies.  Awesu-home! No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel! It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.  Parents? He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around. Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute! Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner. Hey, you guys came back! Huh. I dunno.

Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors! How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog? Good job, wizard. My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings. The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace.  We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you. Woww. We have come to reclaim the one tape!   No, we have to return it!  Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too. Nothing.  Hey, kid! Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents! There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body! Oh crap, dude! Ogh.  Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders. We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon. Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange.  But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.  Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see? What do we do with it? I will take it!  I will walk to the video store. No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember? True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store. Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.

Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives. Awesome! Uh, over here please? We told you that. No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body. Heh hey wait a minute dude. He seemed better on TV?  Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you?  We don't get to go to Scotland?  Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.  That's us. Come on. Huh? Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually. Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave.   What?? Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!  Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please. I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.. Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up. Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real. Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life. Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun. No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real. No dude, you're a douche. Then you're a stupid douche. I'm nine years old. You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch.  Kyle! Kyle! Look, I went and saw that guy. He's just a big douche. Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them. No, he's not.  Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you? Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay? Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you. Does this month, November, hold a special significance? Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"" See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man. I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday."" Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money."" No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about. What?!  No wait. Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter. No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""  Stop it! I didn't do anything!  I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely.""  Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally! Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience. Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead!  No, I don't think either one of us can.  I'm saying this to you,, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever! Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche! Fine, douche!  No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience. You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche.  Yeah. There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself. No, it can't be. Oh, dude!

I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no!   Stop it.  No. Quit it. Hey guys. This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32. Shut up, Cartman!  God-damnit! Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters. I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him. I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room! Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?  Dude, how long has your future self been around? Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future?? Where is he now? Liver medicine? Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?! Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?  Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet?  Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters.  Here it is. Motivation Corp.   Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go.  What the hell is going on here? I can't believe it! It's all a scam! They've all been lying to us this whole time!  Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated! They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors! It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it! Who's that? What? We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that! ...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care. But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!  No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.  Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing.  Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?  Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow? Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents! Fine, then you can come with me.  I guess this is it. Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents? Cartman?? What the hell are you doing here?! God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go.   Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business! How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?! Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol. How much is this going to cost us?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! That's not neato, that sucks. You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized! Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me! Dude! No, that's too extreme! Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!  Hey future self. You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep? You must know what I'm talking about. Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future.  No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across. What?  Hide and go seek, huh?! I don't believe that he's my future self! No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear. But I have to know for sure.  Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it. Yes?  AAAH!  That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake. Butters! Butters, we've go-!

You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody.  His plan was to use a hammer. Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head.  The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.  Just the news.

If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up.

Oh, they took our jobs! I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to-   Who is that? Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs! Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away. I wanted my job! Timecist? People from the future. Right, got it. That's right!  Can you speak in present-day English please? Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.  No, a double cheeseburger and fries! What?! I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger! No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks! Aw- awwww! Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you? They took yer jarb!! I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better.  I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work. We're doing it! Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay. Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile.

Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power. We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are. Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny.

Get near the puck!  Tie? Well, what does that mean? Hello? How are you feeling? Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing? Oh boy. But what can I do? Well, ah, I mean... Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em. Well, sure we can. Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything? They're not gonna kill us.  Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end. Hey that's right. We need a ringer.  It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise.  Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.  All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win! Huh? S-so then we win? Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!

I have to give him what he wants. What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help.  First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go! Okay, fine.  You said ""hand over the bunny."" Hey, what the hell! Jesus, you did answer my prayer!  No! No!

It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it! Jesus! What are you doing here? Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything? Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that. It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial. Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair. Thanks a lot.

Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets... Our... scause? Dude, the hell just happen? People are saying that?  Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.  We did it.   Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?!  It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along. We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.

We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all. 'Kay. Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream.

Our band is gonna be huge. Hey. What's wrong, Jimmy? Yeah, we can get you a liver transplant. How come? No homosexuality?! We're trying to do a band biopic! Yeah. what's wrong with that? Yeah, because I hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town! I can't stand my dad anymore, and if I want to do death metal, I can! It's a free country! Aw, come on! But that will take forever! Now I know how all the writers in Hollywood feel.  I can't do it anymore, you guys. I can't even think with the Chinese government censoring everything I write. It's so wrong. You know, I mean, we live in a time when the only movies us American kids go see are ones that are approved by China. We just gotta face it. A death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore. The only band that would get approved by China would be all vanilla and cheesy.  I'm gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever.   Kyle! Dude, you're back!  Not really. We just almost had a biopic made for our band, but ...wait a minute...  Wait, vanilla and cheesy! I've got it. I've got it! Cut. Cut, cut!  This is all wrong. Yeah, but I can't sell my soul like this. I want to get away from that farm, more than anything, but it's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art.  I don't care how many people you have! I've got something in me that just won't let me be a part of all this. I wanna be proud of who we are, guys!

What if he feels his body shutting down right now? It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops. Uh, hi, it's. I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick. Nono,, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people.
