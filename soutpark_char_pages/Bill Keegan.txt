}}{{LinkDisambig|Bill (Disambiguation)}}
'''Bill Keegan''' is a news reporter and sometimes anchor for [[Channel 4 News]]. He first appeared in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Naughty Ninjas]]".

He is the main news anchorman in [[Season Nineteen]], [[Season Twenty]] and most of [[Season Twenty-One]], but is shifted into acting as a reporter afterward.

==Background==
Bill became the news anchor for the Channel 4 Evening News. His former colleagues, including [[Newsmen|Tom]] and Kevin Jarvis, remember him for his work at WCFO and for being a douchebag at the conventions. They believe him to be a sellout and believe he is working for the evil advertisements trying to destroy humanity, but he remains the main anchor for a while after [[Leslie Meyers]]' defeat. 

From "[[Dead Kids]]" on, he appears to be an on-location reporter instead. 

During the [[COVID-19]] Pandemic, he became jealous that young people like him are being denied [[COVID-19 Vaccine|vaccine]], and older people are getting theirs, and begins lashing out on his partner [[Tom (Newsman)|Tom]] while on the air when they report on stories about vaccinations.
