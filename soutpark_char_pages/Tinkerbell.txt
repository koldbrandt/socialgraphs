'''Tinkerbell''' was [[Paris Hilton]]'s pet chihuahua. She made only one appearance in the [[Season Eight]] episode "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]". 

==Background==
In Hilton's limo, Tinkerbell uses Hilton's cellphone as a distraction while she gets the driver's revolver, the gun which she uses to commit suicide with. Afterward, Tinkerbell is "replaced" by Mr. Biggles ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]).

==Appearance==
Tinkerbell has dark brown fur with a light blue bow tie, a teal gemstone necklace, and dog shoes. Her appearance is a direct reference to how Paris Hilton dresses up her dogs as if they were fashion accessories instead of treating them like actual pets.
