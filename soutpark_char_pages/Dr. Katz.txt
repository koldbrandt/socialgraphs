'''Dr. Katz''' is the main character from ''Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist''. He appeared in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Summer Sucks]]", where he is seen giving psychotherapy to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], who was vacationing in New York. Dr. Katz believed that Mr. Hat was a manifestation of Mr. Garrison's homosexuality, which angered Mr. Garrison. Immediately afterwards, a gigantic charcoal snake destroyed part of New York, which also cut a swath of destruction through Dr. Katz's office, smothering him to death. Mr. Garrison, who shielded himself from the charcoal snake and emerged unscathed, felt that Dr. Katz deserved such a fate for his remarks about himself and Mr. Hat.

==Appearance==
Dr. Katz wears a yellow button-up shirt and a red tie. He is mostly bald with black hair on the sides and back of his head. He has black eyebrows.

==Trivia==
* The outlines of Dr. Katz are squiggly, referencing the "Squigglevision" animation style of the show.
* Coincidentally, a few months after "Summer Sucks" aired, MAD Magazine did a simultaneous parody in which Katz, along with his son Ben and assistant Laura, who is also Ben's girlfriend, moved to South Park and set up a practice in town. Unfortunately, the trials of working and living in South Park, having to listen to head cases like [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] (whose file contains over 450 folders) and Mr. Garrison, while Ben catches Laura in bed with [[Chef]], quickly leave him questioning his decision, and after a broken pencil starts a chain reaction in which [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is decapitated by his framed diploma, he calls his New York clients begging them to take him back.
