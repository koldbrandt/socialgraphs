{{LinkDisambig|Gary (Disambiguation)}}
'''Gary Harrison Jr.''' is the son of [[Mr. Harrison]] and [[Mrs. Harrison]]. He appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[All About Mormons]]".

==Background==
When Gary joins the [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade class]], [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] tells the class about Gary's past. Gary previously lived in [[Utah]], where he was a straight-A student and captain of the wrestling team. He has been in two toothpaste commercials.

==Appearance==
Gary has wavy blond hair parted on the right side and swept in a smooth style. He wears an open turquoise jacket, a white collarless shirt, light blue jeans, and black shoes. He also wears a gray belt with a metal, D-style belt buckle.

==Personality==
Gary's personality appears to be shaped largely by his family and religion, Mormonism. He is friendly, outgoing, and optimistic. When he is teased and bullied by other students at school, he does not appear to be bothered by it. For example, in "[[All About Mormons]]", [[Eric Cartman]] introduces himself to Gary as "Ura Fag." Rather than acting upset or embarrassed, Gary laughs. Later, when Stan threatens to “kick [his] ass,” Gary promises not to fight back and even hopes that they can be friends someday.

Although he is friendly and forgiving, Gary is not a pushover. When Stan refuses to be Gary's friend because of his religion, Gary responds with a very thoughtful speech about how proud he is to be Mormon and what it has done for him. The speech ends with: "All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan. But you were so high and mighty that you couldn't just look past my religion and be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls."

==Family==
===Parents===
Gary's parents are very supportive and nurturing, and he loves and respects them for it. He has a very close relationship with his parents.

===Siblings===
Gary has four siblings: [[Mark Harrison|Mark]], [[Jenny Harrison|Jenny]], [[David Harrison|David]], and [[Amanda Harrison]]. Gary has a strong relationship with all of his siblings. They never fight and genuinely enjoy spending time together. All five siblings play musical instruments, and perform a song for their parents and [[Stan Marsh]] in "[[All About Mormons]]".

==Relationships==
===[[Stan Marsh]]===
After approaching Gary with the intention of "kicking his ass", Stan realizes that Gary is actually a very nice person. Gary and Stan start hanging out together, though Stan becomes a little reluctant to participate in this developing acquaintance, as the other boys, notably [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], began teasing him for "being in love". Finally, after hearing the story of ''The Book of Mormon'', Stan decides that Mormonism is ridiculous, and he no longer wants to be Gary's friend over his religion. The next day, he tells Stan off for being unable to look past his religion, telling him to "suck my (his) balls".
