'''Mitch Murphy''' or '''Mitch Harris''' is an officer with the [[Park County Police]] as a [[wikipedia:comic foil|comic foil]] as well as an ''Aide-de-Camp'' to [[Sergeant Yates]]. He is first seen briefly in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".

==Background==
His first major appearance is in "[[The Jeffersons]]", where he receives a fax about [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jefferson]] possibly being in town and relays it to [[Sergeant Yates]]. In "[[Eek, A Penis!]]", he is also shown to be a sketch artist, drawing [[Mickey Mouse]] with an erect penis based on [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison's]] description of the penis-mouse. In "[[The China Probrem]]", he is shown to be a fan of the [[Indiana Jones]] franchise, agreeing to help [[The Boys|the boys]] press charges and pursue the case against [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]].

==Appearance==
Mitch is normally seen wearing a blue shirt with braces and a tie. He has a holster containing a stainless Smith and Wesson 5900-series pistol with wood grips (as does his partner Harrison Yates, indicating this is most likely the standard issue duty sidearm for South Park PD) and on the other side of his shirt, his badge. He wears black trousers and has greyish-brown hair. Despite this, he seems to generally be portrayed as a young man.
