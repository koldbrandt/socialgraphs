'''Thumper''' is a skiing instructor who appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Asspen]]", where he was initially seen instructing [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Ike Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Butters Stotch]] the basics of skiing. After being challenged by [[Tad Mikowski]], Stan asked Thumper for help learning how to ski. During a montage, Thumper was able to improve Stan's skiing skills enough for him to win the race down the [[K-13]]. He later made a small appearance at the end of "[[Buddha Box]]", where he is seen with a Buddha box on his head.
