==Background==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] decides to prank [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] by dressing up a cow to look ginger, and later shares it online. However, the post is discovered by various news networks around the world. During the news broadcast, the first reporter began performing seppuku, continuing to report on the news as he sliced his own belly. As he drops onto the desk, another reporter beheads the former with a katana, before shooting himself on the head.

The first reporter wears a black suit with light blue shirt and brown checkered tie, brown pants and a pair of round-framed glasses. While reporting on the news, he carried a tantō, a Japanese short sword.

The second reporter wears a dull brown suit with light blue shirt and red tie.

They have small eyes, which is a stereotypical characteristic of Asians seen in the series.
