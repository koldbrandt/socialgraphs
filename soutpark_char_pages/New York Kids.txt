The '''New York Kids''' are a group of third-graders from [[New York]] who appear in the [[Season Three]] episode "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]".

==Background==
The New York Kids call the [[South Park]] kids rednecks and queefs when they first meet, then ridicule [[The Boys|the boys]] for not knowing what queef means. The boys decide to strike back by making up the word 'mung', which is actually a word. The New York Kids mercilessly point out their mistake and rip on them again. This pushes the boys further into finding [[The Brown Note|the brown note]] and replacing the final note with it.

The result is that everyone in the world craps their pants. Twenty hours later the New York Kids finally discover that the boys are culprits, and they think it's cool so they apologize to the boys for ripping on them.

After that episode, they were only seen on posters at [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]].

==Appearance==
Like any other group, they vary in sexes and races. But unlike South Park kids, they all wear lighter clothes, and many of them have gold ornaments, which indicate their wealth.

==Personality==
The New York kids are stereotypical metropolitan people, and have a strong prejudice against people from rural areas or smaller cities. Besides this, they are almost the same as any other kids in the show, being vulgar and uncouth. They seem to know a lot more about sexual terms than the South Park boys.
