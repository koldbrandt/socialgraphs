'''Vanity''' is an "out-of-control" teenage girl who appears on the ''Maury Povich Show'' in [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Freak Strike]]".

==Background==
She only appears in "[[Freak Strike]]" on the Maury Povich TV show. She and [[Eric Cartman]] "compete" on the show so Cartman will "win" the prize. She claims that she takes drugs, has sex with older men, engaged with gangs, and has taken part in a drive-by-shooting. Vanity physically beats her mother Vanessa and insults her on set. After the episode she is not seen again. Her catch phrase was "I can do what I want", which Cartman parodied into "Whateva whateva, I'll do what I want".

==Appearance==
Vanity has a unique sense of fashion. She wears pink mini-shorts with a red see-through skirt over it. She also wears a purple wristband on her right hand and a pink top which barely covers the top part of her torso. She is blonde, overweight, and wears an excessive amount of makeup, hence her name.

==Personality==
Vanity is extremely abusive and cruel, verbally and physically abusing her own suffering mother with no remorse. She is highly arrogant and enjoys boasting of her supposed debauched endeavors, with outrageous claims of highly illegal and unacceptable behavior. However, below her ferocious demeanor, she seems insecure, as she felt threatened by Cartman's far superior claims of immoral deeds.
