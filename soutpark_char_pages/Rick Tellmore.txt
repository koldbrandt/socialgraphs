'''Rick Tellmore''' is a [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] resident who waits outside the [[South Park Mall]] for Black Friday sales. He appears in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Titties and Dragons]]".

==Background==
[[Niles Lawson|A reporter]] interviews Tellmore who has been waiting outside the mall for over six days. While waiting, Tellmore and his family were starving so they drew straws. He ate his 5-year-old son, who drew the shorted straw, in order to maintain his position in line for a $20 Blu-ray player. He then goes on to sing "[[I Ate My Son 'Fer A Blu-Ray Player]]" to bring the Christmas spirit to the idea of eating his own son.

==Appearance==
Rick Tellmore wears white tennis shoes, blue jeans, and a gray hooded sweater under a brown jacket. He is mostly balding, with gray hair on the sides and back of his head. He also wears a brown hat.
