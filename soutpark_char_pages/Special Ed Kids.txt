The '''Special Ed Kids''' are a group of children that appear on several episodes of the show and in the ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' DLC, [[Bring the Crunch]].

==Background==
Their first appearance is in "[[Up the Down Steroid]]" where several of them are seen training for the special Olympics. They later appear in "[[Crippled Summer]]" where they are seen on [[Lake Tardicaca]], many of them are seen on the [[Red Team]] in this episode. For the time being their last appearance is in "[[Moss Piglets]]" where they are seen as participants in the science fair.

Although they appear in a good number of episodes, they don't have as big a role as [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] and are mostly used as background characters.
