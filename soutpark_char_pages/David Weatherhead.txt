'''David Weatherhead''' is one of the many foster children under the care of the [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead|Weatherheads]]. He attends [[Greeley Elementary]] and appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[The Poor Kid]]".

==Background==
He claimed he saw an [[Mysterion|angel]] in his room the night before. However, as this claim clashed with the Weatherheads' agnostic doctrine, David was sent to the [[The Punishment Room|punishment room]] to be tortured by the foster father, with [[Dr. Pep-er]] being sprayed into his face until he confessed that certainties such as angels were false. Since the Weatherheads are agonistic, David must not be certain of everything that happens around him.

==Appearance==
David has messy blond hair. He wears a dirty, ripped blue t-shirt and a dirty pair of red shorts with white stripes. He also wears cheap glasses that are held together by tape.
