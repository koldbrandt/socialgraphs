The '''Council of Nine''' is the ruling body over the world of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]]. It was featured in the [[Season Eleven]] story arc "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]] and "[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]".

==Background==
The Council of Nine references the Greek Gods' own Council of Nine. Instead of Greek gods, this organization is made up of characters from modern fictitious literature and films. The Council headquarters is located at Castle Sunshine.

[[Butters Stotch]] is called upon by the council to be the "key" and save the worlds imaginations from the "terrorists". Being a reluctant a hero, Butters tries to run away from his duties. [[Aslan the Lion]] gives him a boost of confidence and teaches him how to conjure up the defenses to defeat the terrorists with his imagination.

==Prominence==
