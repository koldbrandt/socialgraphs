==Appearance==
The most prominent feature of Jeff Bezos is unarguably his ridiculously large head, with veins standing out. Funny enough, his head looks like a large buttock when observing from behind. He wears a light grey suit.

==Trivia==
*Bezos is the only character in the series who doesn't move their lips when speaking, because he speaks telepathically.
*His appearance and telepathic ability are a reference to the [[w:c:memory-alpha:Talosians|Talosians]] from ''[[Wikipedia:Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' pilot episode "[[Wikipedia:The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]".
*In "[[Unfulfilled]]", he mentions that he longs to return to Bezos and the ending song in "[[Bike Parade]]" refers to him as "Bezosian".
*His voice is similar to [[Doctor Timothy]] from ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Prominence==
*"[[Unfulfilled]]" - Comes to South Park, disappointed in the mayor, when the mass strike at the fulfillment center occurs.
*"[[Bike Parade]]" - The town turns against him, forcing him to leave.
