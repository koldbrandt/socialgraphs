The '''Penis Mouse''' is a mouse with a penis growing on its back that made its only appearance in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[Eek, A Penis!]]".

When [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]] regrets having a sex change operation, she goes to a [[Research Group Laboratories|research group]] asking them if they can grow a penis on a mouse's back after seeing a mouse with an ear growing on its back. Later on, they have shown to have successfully grown a penis on a mouse, but when Ms. Garrison tries to hold it in her hand, she accidentally lets the mouse loose. She and the researchers run around town trying to capture the mouse but to no avail. The mouse however, eventually finds Ms. Garrison sitting on a bench and gets into her hand. Later, at [[South Park Elementary]], Ms. Garrison is shown to have underwent her surgery to become a man again and seems to have kept the mouse as a pet, though it has not been seen in any future episodes.
