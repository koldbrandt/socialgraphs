'''Loogie's Associates''' are characters who appear in the episode "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]", where they are seen working for [[Loogie]]'s tooth trading business. The only one of the three who has a name is Kolovski, the boy with the green shirt.

==Background==
Loogie's Associates start a conflict with [[The Boys]] after finding them in [[Cherry Creek]] doing the same thing that they always did: putting a tooth under the pillow of a rich child and collect the money later. Loogie's Associates take the boys to [[Loogie's Ristorante]], where Loogie, their boss, reveals how the tooth trade works.

Loogie's Associates are later seen throwing [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] (who was trapped in concrete galoshes) into a river to drown. However, they end up throwing him in a shallow part of the river.

They later appear at the end of the episode with Loogie and the rest of the crew, to finally end [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], but before they can do anything, they are caught by the dentists (led by [[Tom Foley|Dr. Foley]], who knew about Tooth Trade), but they are prevented after Kyle summons a giant squirrel chicken, which scares all dentists and Loogie's crew.

==Appearance==
Kolovski has spiky brown hair and wears a white shirt under a green jacket and jeans. One of the other two boys has combed orange hair and wears a white shirt under a red jacket, brown belt with golden buckle, and blue jeans. The other has curly brown hair and wears a white shirt under a yellow long-sleeved shirt and dark green pants.
