'''Nobunaga Hiroichi''' is a Japanese correspondent for the SNN news channel who appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]".

==Background==
When [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] build a massive ladder to [[Heaven]] so they can get tickets to [[Lolly's Candy Factory]] from [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], the Japanese claim to have already reached Heaven with their own ladder to poke fun of the United States, which turns out to be a studio in Japan decorated to look like Heaven. Despite this, the boys parents still believe the Japanese reached Heaven before them.

==Appearance==
Nobunaga has combed black hair that appears to be graying, thin black eyebrows, and a small black mustache. He wears a dark blue suit, a white undershirt, a red tie, black pants, and black shoes. He also has stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes and exaggerated accents.
