'''Gelgameks''' are an alien species and represent the Roman Catholic Church on their planet. They are seen at the Vatican protesting [[Priest Maxi]]'s request to change the Holy Law to stop molesting little boys in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]".

==Appearance==
The Gelgamek Bishop looks like a rotund toad-person with green slimy skin and large eyes. The other Gelgameks with him resemble the ones in the picture on the right; it is not known why this species has two wildly different kinds of appearances, despite both of them presumably being males of the species. The Gelgamek Bishop claims the Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. This is the reason Gelgameks do not want to give up molesting boys.

==Quotes==
*'''Gelgamek Bishop''': "Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem." from "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]".

==Trivia==
