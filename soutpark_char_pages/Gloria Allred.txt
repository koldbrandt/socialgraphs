}}
'''Gloria Allred''' is an attorney and human rights activist who appears in the [[Season Five]] episode "[[Cripple Fight]]".

==Background==
Gloria speaks out on her talk show, accusing the Mountain Scouts of being homophobic. She takes the case to the Colorado Supreme Court, in support of [[Big Gay Al]], who was sacked from his job as a scout master for being homosexual. Big Gay Al wins the case but refuses to accept his job back. He believes that if he is allowed to express his homosexual nature, then the mountain scouts should be allowed to express their views on homosexuality. This angers Gloria and she accuses Big Gay Al of being a homophobe.

==Appearance==
Gloria wears a yellow suit and has wavy brown hair. She has an exaggerated amount of make up and has noticeable signs of aging.

==Personality==
She is fiercely devoted to promoting equal rights, even going to outrageously claim Big Gay Al to be homophobic, despite being gay himself, showing she is ironically intolerant of those with different views to herself. She also seems quite arrogant and brash, voraciously professing all the credit for having defeated the scouts in the courts.

And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al."
