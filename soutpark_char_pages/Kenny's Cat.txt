==Background==
Despite a ban of cats in South Park in order to combat the problem of children getting high on cat urine (or "cheesing"), Kenny still kept a few cats in [[McCormick Residence|his house]]. He would eventually be caught cheesing when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] visited his house. The cat was then taken by Kyle for safekeeping in his house, stashing it in his clothes drawers. However it was discovered by [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]], who grounded Kyle for keeping a cat in the house. [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] takes the cat down to the basement, but ended up cheesing himself.
