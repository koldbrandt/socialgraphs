'''Woodsy Owl''' is an owl mascot who appeared in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode "[[Insheeption]]".

==Background==
Woodsy appears in the episode "[[Insheeption]]", where he is in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s dream about his childhood. He first appears in Mr. Mackey's class on their field trip to remind them to "Please pick up your trash and keep our forests clean!" to which he then sings a small song.

He later reappears when Mackey, who is trying to see what actually traumatized him on that day, opens up a small cabin door revealing Woodsy molesting him. Seconds later, the bad dream begins to manifest itself and Woodsy's eyes turn an evil red. He charges at the cast of the movie "Inception"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception|title=Inception - Wikipedia}}</ref> and seconds later, he is killed by [[Freddy Krueger]]. During his rampage, Woodsy kills the [[Mr. Yelman|sheep herder]].

==Appearance==
