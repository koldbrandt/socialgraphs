==Personality==
Kind, liberal, and defensive, Theresa is insecure about her family's financial situation and living in a trailer, which she prefers to call a "tiny home." She is sensitive about her family's successes, or rather the lack thereof, so she makes the claim that her family only downsized to benefit the environment in an attempt paint a better picture of her unfortunate familial status. She is liberal, and cares a great deal about the environment, acquainting a person's successes with their treatment of the Earth. She is very defensive and is persistent in her efforts to cover up or sugarcoat the things about herself she isn't proud of.
