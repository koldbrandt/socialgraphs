:''For [[Monica Ryland]]'s boyfriend, see [[Jake (The Stick of Truth)]].''
'''Jake''' was a member of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, shown in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]". His appearance was short-lived, however, as he got too close to a carnivorous flower and was presumably eaten. Despite [[Ms. Stevens]] presumably failing to save him, he was seen later in the episode, so it should be assumed that he is alive.

Jake had a cameo in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (most notably at the "[[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]]" meeting, which he left due to there being no "punch and pie"), at the dance in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]", and as a prisoner at [[Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall]] in "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]".

==Appearance==
Jake has short, grayish-brown hair, had freckles, and wears a green sweater and brown pants. In ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'', he wears a yellow sweater.

==Personality==
Jake knows everything about the rainforest and is the leader of the Getting Gay with Kids choir. He may have also died because he was being eaten by a carnivorous flower and Ms. Stevens was trying to get Jake out; it is possible that Ms. Stevens succeeded, or didn't succeed and there was an error in his continuation on the show, since he did appear in a couple of episodes like "[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]" (in this example he was a prisoner), made a cameo in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (he was the one who wanted to know if there was punch and pie or not and after that he left the meeting), and was seen at the dance in "[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]". In the episode "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", he's probably the only kid other than [[Kelly]] who talked the whole episode until he possibly died from being eaten by the carnivorous flower.

*"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]" - Leader of the Getting Gay with Kids choir.
