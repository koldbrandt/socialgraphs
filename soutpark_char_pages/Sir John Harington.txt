'''Sir John Harington''' was a writer as well as the inventor of the modern flush toilet, which he calls his "porcelain toilet machine". He first appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]", where he bursted into the courtroom as the [[Hoffman and Turk Attorney|attorney]] from [[Hoffman and Turk Law Offices]] performed a "sue-ance".

==Background==
After [[Clyde Donovan]]'s mother [[Betsy Donovan|Betsy]] died, [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] set out to help him sue Sir John Harington. Upon arrival to Hoffman and Turk Law Offices, they learned that they could sue the dead with a "sue-ance". Although their initial "sue-ances" were unsuccessful, Harington does appear before the county court to demonstrate the proper use of a toilet. Just as what [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] mentions in class, Sir Harington advised everyone that the proper way to sit on a toilet was to face the toilet bowl, as to use it as a shelf for books, quills, and ink.

==Appearance==
Sir Harington wears formal attire, consisting of black shoes, light gray pants, a white blouse, a black colonial-style coat, and a brown belt. He has dark brown hair, a brown beard, and a long mustache.
