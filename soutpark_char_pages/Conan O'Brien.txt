'''Conan O'Brien''' is the host of his own show ''Conan'', and appears in the film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

==Background==
[[File:Conan_o'brien_2.png|thumb|Conan's appearance in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.|left]]
O'Brien appeared in the film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', in which he interviewed guests [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Terrance and Phillip]], before tricking Terrance and Phillip into being captured by [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Mothers Against Canada]] to be executed. Feeling guilty for betraying them, he commits suicide by jumping out a window. Despite Kenny's wish, he can be seen in Hell briefly in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]".

He reappeared in "[[Fishsticks]]" with a completely new design, introducing [[Carlos Mencia]] on ''Late Night'', indirectly leading to his murder by [[Kanye West]], showing he had been revived at some point.

He appeared yet again, though without lines, in "[[Funnybot]]" though he can barely be seen in the final episode, as one of the out-of-work comedians holding up the school.

==Appearance==
In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Conan O'Brien wears a green suit and a blue necktie. He has wavy red hair, red eyebrows, and has no other facial hair.

In "[[Fishsticks]]", he wore a black suit with a black tie. In his redesign, his wavy red hair is more detailed and he retains his red eyebrows, albeit with more detail. Conan's redesign resembles himself more than the original design as seen in the film.

==Prominence==
*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Helps the [[Mothers Against Canada]] kidnap [[Terrance and Phillip]], then shortly after, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window.
*"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" - Appears briefly in [[Hell]].
*"[[Fishsticks]]" - Introduces [[Carlos Mencia]] on ''Late Night''.
*"[[Funnybot]]" - Appears as one of the out-of-work comedians holding up the school.

==Trivia==
* The voice of Conan O'Brien in the film was performed by actor [[Brent Spiner]], best known for his role as Data from ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Spiner confirmed on Twitter he did not return for "[[Fishsticks]]".
*Conan O'Brien was originally meant to kill himself with a gunshot to the head in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' instead of jumping out of the window to his death, but the MPAA rejected the original scene on basis of the gun violence since the Columbine High School massacre, so it was switched out with the scene in which O'Brien jumps and falls to his death.
*In an [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards|unofficial short]] involving O'Brien going to the Emmy Awards, Conan can be seen locking himself in [[Stan Marsh]]'s closet, a nod to the episode, "[[Trapped in the Closet]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o67XXwVrts4|title=2006 Emmys Opening|publisher=Youtube}}</ref>
