'''Florence Cartman''' is [[Eric Cartman]]'s great-grandmother; she is also the mother of [[Mabel Cartman]] and maternal grandmother of [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] and [[Howard Cartman]]. She appears in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]". She was not seen at her [[Mabel Cartman|daughter's]] funeral in "[[Cartmanland]]".

==Appearance==
During her first appearance, she is shown as an overweight old lady with a very wrinkly face and a green dress. Due to her weight and age, she is usually seen with a walker to help her move. It is also presumed that she suffers from urinary incontinence as she has to have a catheter bag with her at all times.

==Personality==
Like Cartman, she is shown to have quite a temper. This can be seen when her daughter asks her to "do the honors" of saying grace which causes her to respond quite aggressively, as she feels she always does it.
