'''Allison''' appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[D-Yikes!]]".

==Background==
Allison meets [[Mrs. Garrison]] at a gym. After overhearing Garrison bad-mouthing men, she assumed that she's a lesbian and asks her to join her at the local girl bar [[Les Bos]]. After realizing that it's a lesbian bar, Mrs. Garrison freaks out, until calmed by Allison. After sharing a kiss, they spend the rest of the night having sex. Allison then joins Mrs. Garrison's crusade to protect Les Bos from rival [[Xerxes]] who wants to take over the bar.

==Appearance==
Allison has long, brown hair, wrinkles near her lip and chin, and tired eyes. She wears a pink, button-up shirt brown pants, and green earrings.

==Personality==
She appears to be unintelligent, mistaking [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]'s rantings about men as a confirmation of sexuality. Judging by her choice of Mrs. Garrison as a sexual partner, we can assume she likes "butch" women.

==Relationships==
===[[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]===
She dated Mrs. Garrison in "[[D-Yikes!]]". Mrs. Garrison has since changed back into a man, so we can only assume their relationship is over.

==Trivia==
*A [[Mrs. Trumski|woman]] who looks extremely similar to Allison appears in "[[Bass to Mouth]]". The woman is the mother of [[Vernon Trumski]], the boy who had [[Lemmiwinks]]. The woman has the same body shape as Allison, and similar facial features.
