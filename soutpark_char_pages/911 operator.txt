The '''911 Operator''' appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]" as a [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] employee. She was later seen as a police dispatcher in the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[Super Fun Time]]".

==Background==
In "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", she is seen working as a support line representative at Blizzard. She picks up [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s call, who tells her that [[Jenkins|a player]] keeps on killing other people's characters in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. She tells him that the problem will be fixed and they will ban the player from the network.

She makes another appearance in "[[Super Fun Time]]" as a police dispatcher. After [[the 4th Grade]] has been taken hostage by [[The Burger King Bandits]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] calls 911 and she picks up his call. He informs her about the hostage situation in [[Pioneer Village]]. She asks him if it is not the place where "employees won't break character", To which Kyle responds: "Sister, you don't know the half of it."

She most likely has a daughter, as a picture of a little girl is shown on the wall in her cubicle.

==Appearance==
She wears dark blues short sleeve shirt, a dispatcher badge, and a green single-ear headphone with a microphone.
