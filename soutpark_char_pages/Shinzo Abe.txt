'''Shinzo Abe''' is a Japanese politician who formerly served as the prime minister of [[Japan]]. An image of Abe appears in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Handicar]]", when news of the Wacky Races being called upon broke out.

==Background==
It was reported that Shinzo Abe insisted any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. However should the race gets the go-ahead, they would participate with their completely self-driven prototype Lexus. The self-driven car eventually made its way into the race.
