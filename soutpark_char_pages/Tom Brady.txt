'''Tom Brady''' is the current quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who has made a few appearances on the show.

==Background==
Tom Brady is first mentioned in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode "[[Faith Hilling]]" in the form of "Bradying", a meme made popular by a photo of Brady sitting on the ground with his head lowered and his hands between his legs.

Brady makes his first appearance ''South Park'' style in the Season Sixteen episode "[[Sarcastaball]]" as one of the sports celebrities who endorses the sports drink [[Butters' Creamy Goo]], which is really [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] semen.

Brady appears again in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode "[[Taming Strange]]", where it was shown that he and [[Ike Broflovski]] had accidentally received each other's medications. He is shown crapping his pants during a game and then taking his "Bradying" pose.

He was mentioned again in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode "[[Stunning and Brave]]", where [[Eric Cartman]] says he is going to "Tom Brady this thing" after getting 4 days of detention from [[PC Principal]], referencing Brady's four-game suspension from the NFL due to the "Deflategate" scandal. Cartman later portrays Brady in a dream.

Brady plays a significant role in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode "[[Turd Burglars]]", where several people, including the press, try to get their hands on his "spice" to cure the C Diff disease by asking him if they can have some of his feces.

In the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]", one of the notes on [[Bob White]]'s conspiracy theory board reads "THE SUPER BOWL WAS FAKED FORMER 'PATRIOT' WINS?". This is in reference to Brady, who had left the New England Patriots to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020. It is also a reference to several conspiracy theories on the internet that claim Super Bowl LV was fixed in Brady's favor. 

== Appearance ==
Tom Brady has brown hair and brown eyebrows. He wears a blue New England Patriots uniform with his team number "12" on it as well as white pants and white sneakers. In "[[Turd Burglars]]", he also wears a gray hooded sweatshirt and black pants. He has slight facial stubble.

==Prominence==
*"[[Faith Hilling]]"
*"[[Sarcastaball]]"
*"[[Taming Strange]]"
*"[[Stunning and Brave]]"
*"[[Turd Burglars]]"
