'''Mrs. Joe Gargery''' appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Pip]]". Like [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]], she is a literary counterpart from Charles Dickens' classic tale, ''Great Expectations''. She is Pip's hot-tempered adult sister, and the wife of [[Joe Gargery]].

==Background==
Mrs. Joe Gargery is Pip's adult sister. She is always yelling at Pip about getting a job, and she's frequently shown being mean and obnoxious to her husband. It can also be implied that she beats him as well. Apparently, she also enjoys beating Pip in the head with a log.

==Appearance==
She wears a dirty white shirt over a brown, tattered dress. She has unkempt blonde hair, poor sense of style in terms of her makeup, and she also wears a green scarf. She appears greatly aged.

==Personality==
She is mean, abusive, and aggressive. This is evident in her abusive treatment of Pip and her husband.
