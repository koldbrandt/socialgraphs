==Background==
In "[[The City Part of Town]]", he is sent to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to decide if the town deserves a [[Whole Foods Market]]. The people of South Park royally welcome his arrival and go to great lengths to impress him. He senses that they are acting unnatural at the ceremony so he asks people of South Park to behave normally. He then inspects [[South Park Elementary]], where he asks [[PC Principal]] about how the town has changed and audits a lesson in the fourth-grade classroom. He also visits [[SoDoSoPa]].

The next day, he appears at the ranch to observe the slaughter procedures of local cattle. Meanwhile, [[Tuong Lu Kim|Mr. Kim]], along with his [[Child Labor Force|child labor force]] put up a promotional video of [[CtPaTown]]. When [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and the other [[City People|townfolks]] get mad at him, they go to thrash him. Upon seeing this, the representative is so deeply impressed by the social consciousness they show during the fight that he announces that South Park is qualified for a [[Whole Foods Market]], much to the delight on everyone except [[Tuong Lu Kim|Mr. Kim]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].

==Appearance==
The Whole Foods representative wears a black-green jacket, a gray-green Whole Goods uniform inside, gray pants, and brown leather shoes. He has dyed brown combover hair, a small mouth, and a double chin. His facial expression is serious all the time, with his eyes always looking suspiciously around. He holds a riding crop under his arm.

==Personality==
The Whole Foods representative has a sullen demeanor and an air of grim authority. When he speaks, his comments are stern and direct. Near the end of the episode, he is shown to have correctly deduced that the town of South Park is simply pretending to have a social conscience rather than actually caring about each other, showing he is also observant and shrewd.
