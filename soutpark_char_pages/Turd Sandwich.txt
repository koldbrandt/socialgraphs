'''Turd Sandwich''' is one of the candidates for the [[South Park Elementary]] school mascot. He appeared in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[Douche and Turd]]", where he was seen competing against [[Giant Douche]]. The idea for having a turd sandwich as the school mascot was invented by [[Eric Cartman]], who disagreed with [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s idea to have a giant douche represent the school.

The "Douche and Turd" concept is redone in "[[Member Berries]]". In the election, [[Herbert Garrison]] is the [[Giant Douche]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] is the Turd Sandwich. The Turd Sandwich eventually loses.

==Appearance==
Turd Sandwich is an anthropomorphic sandwich, with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, an olive, and a large piece of fecal matter. He also has long black arms, white gloves, and "South Park" written in black.

==Prominence==
*"[[Douche and Turd]]"
