'''Philip Glass''' appears in the background in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]" as the minimalist composer from New York who performs music during the "happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play".

==Appearance==
Phillip Glass wears a black shirt, black pants, and has curly black hair. He can be seen in front of two gray keyboards.

==Trivia==
*[[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] strongly dislike Glass, citing him taking the character and the magic out of Christmas. They they mention that can "you basically give a third grader a keyboard, tell him to mess around, sell that music as one of Phillip Glass' albums, and no one would know the difference."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southpark.cc.com/collections/925/season-1-creator-commentary/10|title=Creator Commentary: Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo}}</ref>
