'''Mr. Slave''' is the husband of [[Big Gay Al]]. He is also the ex-boyfriend of [[Herbert Garrison]].

==Background==
He was the homosexual lover of [[Herbert Garrison]], and his teaching aid before the latter had [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|sex reassignment surgery]]. Mr. Slave's catchphrases are "Ooh, Jesus Christ!" or "Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!", delivered in a quavering lisp. He is rarely heard saying anything other than these catchphrases.

His first major role was in "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", in which Mr. Garrison, the [[South Park Elementary|elementary school]] teacher of the main characters, learns that he can sue the education board for a lot of money if he is fired for being gay, and does his best to ensure this happens. To this end he hires Mr. Slave as his classroom assistant, or, for short, "teacher's ass." The lessons become increasingly sexual, and degenerate in nature, culminating in Mr. Garrison inserting the class gerbil, [[Lemmiwinks]], into Mr. Slave's rectum.

In "[[South Park is Gay!]]" he and Mr. Garrison get annoyed about the [[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]] cast making straight people metrosexual. He, Mr. Garrison, and [[Kyle Broflovski]] went to New York to kill them. When they try to turn them into [[Crab People]], [[The Boys|the boys]]' mothers come and kill them.

Despite Mr. Slave's occupation, he is shown to be wise and knowledgeable, offering characters advice when in certain situations. His most prominent moment was in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", when he gave [[Wendy Testaburger]] advice after she wanted to become a whore after seeing that many of her friends had become part of the new trend. Mr. Slave pushed Wendy to not follow the lifestyle due to his own personal experiences and has claimed to be a whore since the day he was born. As a child he has shown to have faked a fever for his mother to take his temperature through his rear end. In his later life he tried to get other boys involved by pretending to be a voice to shout out to beat up the queer kid where he giggles and says "Jesus Christ" after being tackled by all the football boys. He subsequently competed in a 'Whore-Off' with [[Paris Hilton]], culminating in her being forced up Mr. Slave's ass. However, having finished this, Mr. Slave rejected the applause, telling parents that they had to teach their children that people like Paris Hilton were to be despised or they'd never learn it, prompting the girls to apologize to Wendy.

In the episode "[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]", Mr. Garrison has a sex change operation and becomes a woman. Mr. Slave is upset that he was not consulted on the operation beforehand, which starts an argument, he commented that Garrison never stopped to think how everybody else around her would feel about the sex change, and, being gay, is no longer attracted to Garrison as a woman. When Garrison (now referred to as Mrs. Garrison) callously suggests that Mr. Slave simply stop being gay so that they can continue their affair, he says "How can you say that? You're gay too." When Garrison responds that she is a woman, not gay, Mr. Slave walks out, thus ending their relationship. In the episode "[[Follow That Egg!]]", Garrison decides that she wants him back, but learns that she is too late, as Mr. Slave had moved on with [[Big Gay Al]] — to whom he is now engaged. Jilted, Ms. Garrison makes an ardent, though ultimately failed, attempt to get gay marriage banned.

Subsequently, Mr. Slave and Al join in marriage. He was seen later making cameos in "[[The Ring]]" masturbating in the audience at the [[Jonas Brothers]] concert and singing "[[Queef Free]]" along with the other guys in "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]". In "[[The F Word]]", Mr. Slave and Big Gay Al are the first to see the boys' attempts at getting rid of the local [[Harley Riders]], by writing "Fags Get Out!" Initially they are both pained and horrified by the sign, until realizing that the boys did not mean anything disparaging against gays, but were instead using the term "Fag" in regards to the Harley Riders, stating "You can be gay, and not a fag". Al and Mr. Slave both helped to change the definition of "faggot" from a gay person, to an annoying Harley Rider.

In "[[201]]", after Country Kitchen Buffet was destroyed, Mr. Slave is seen saying his catchphrase when he spotted [[Jesus]] and the other members of the Super Best Friends.

Mr. Slave returns in "[[Not Funny]]". The townsfolk are convinced that bombing [[Denmark]] is the preventative solution for their internet histories being made public. The town convinces Mr. Slave to call President [[Herbert Garrison|Garrison]] and convince him to do so. The two had not spoken since the events of "[[Follow That Egg!]]" and Garrison was eager to speak with Mr. Slave. Dismissing Garrison's subtle advances, Mr. Slave intentionally provokes him into attacking Denmark.

==Appearance==
Mr. Slave looks rather similar to [[Wikipedia: Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]], sharing the handlebar mustache, black leather clothing, and the instantly recognizable cap that he wore as a teacher.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Mr. Slave makes an appearance in his house, where his package was mixed up with [[Liane Cartman|Ms. Cartman]]'s, and [[Douchebag]] has to fetch his package from the post office while he gives the package to Liane.

After getting his package, he becomes a Summon in which he forces enemies up his ass, and after that, chases after the remaining fleeing enemies.

Near the end of the game, it is revealed that the FBI or some other organization stuck a snuke up his ass, and the New Kid must go on a journey inside his ass, where he must battle Nazi Bacteria, Armed Guards and the angry [[Sparrow Prince]].
