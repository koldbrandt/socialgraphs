}}
'''Ben Roethlisberger''' is a professional football player that appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, "[[Sexual Healing]]".
He is the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, and the youngest starting QB in NFL history to win the Super Bowl.

==Background==
He is one of the celebrities enrolled in the [[Karne Institute for Sex Addiction]]. However, rather than admitting to their own faults and poor judgment, the center instead places the blame on the fact that they got CAUGHT cheating, and does not bother to teach them to control their impulses.

==Appearance==
He wears a white, number 7 Pittsburgh Steelers football jersey with yellow stripes on the sleeves, a blue pair of pants and black shoes.

==Personality==
He may be unintelligent, believing that the [[Wizard Alien]] must be behind his abnormal sex drive. His goofy dialogue also hints at his low intelligence.
