'''Steve Jobs''' was the former CEO of Apple Inc. He died on October 5, 2011.

==Background==
He first appeared as one of the select rich and famous people [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] invites to view [[IT]] in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[The Entity]]".

Jobs later appeared and played a major role in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]". Still striving to "create the future" by spearheading technological innovation, Jobs directs the creation of a new electronic appliance, the [[HUMANCENTiPAD (Product)|HUMANCENTiPAD]], which consists of three people surgically joined together, mouth to anus.

Because people were already able to share all their videos, music, photos and shit, Jobs reasoned that the only thing left for the iPad to do was walk and read. He hoped to achieve this with his new project. Using [[Junichi Takiyama|a Japanese man]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and an unnamed woman as test subjects, Jobs attempts to get the HUMANCENTiPAD to read terms and conditions before accepting. After a string of abject failures, he is eventually successful.

He then plans to present the HUMANCENTiPAD to [[Eric Cartman]] as a gift, however, [[Gerald Broflovski]] persuades him to sit down and enjoy the present before attempting to create the future. Jobs concedes, agreeing to get Kyle separated from the HUMANCENTiPAD, understanding that through his work he has already left his mark on the world by "connecting" people everywhere.

==Appearance==
In "[[The Entity]]", he appears with dark brown hair, wearing a brown suit and black shirt. In "[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]", he wore his trademark black shirt and blue jeans. He aged significantly between these two episodes.

==Trivia==
*"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]" aired five months before Steve Jobs' death. The documentary ''[[6 Days to Air: The Making of 'South Park']]'', which focused mainly on the making of the episode, aired less than a week after his death.
