'''Najix''' is an alien who works for the Nerzod Productions seen in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Cancelled]]".

==Background==
Najix is the main producer of the hit intergalactic reality TV show ''Earth'' which has made it to over one hundred episodes. Najix is an intergalactic shape-shifting television producer and he runs the company Nerzod Productions.

==Appearance==
Najix is an alien with green and yellow skin and four legs and sharp teeth. Najix has the ability to take on any form, imagined or real. He first appears as [[Randy Marsh]] after reading the boys' minds in an attempt to appear less frightening, but because this reminded them too much of the movie [[Wikipedia:Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]], Najix continued to transform into various forms in an attempt to please them. Eventually, Cartman suggested "a taco that craps ice cream", which Najix settled on.

List of characters that Najix transformed to include:
*[[Don King]]
*[[Frank Sinatra]]
*[[George Burns]]
*[[Jimmie Walker]]
*[[Michael Jordan]]
*[[Missy Elliott]]
*[[Randy Marsh]]
*[[Saddam Hussein]]
*[[Santa Claus]]
*Mr. Roarke and Tattoo of ''Fantasy Island''

==Personality==
Najix is a kind and helpful individual, doing everything he can to make the boys' situation comfortable and hassle-free. Despite his friendly nature, it is hinted that he sees the Earth and humanity as beneath him, making entertainment out of Earth's problems and casually demolishing the planet without remorse when his TV show is cancelled. However, he does allow the boys a chance to speak to the Joozian network heads in order to save their home.

==Powers and Abilities==
He has the ability to shape-shift from his original form based on the thoughts of those around him.

==Quotes==
*'''Najix''': "That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning."
*'''Najix''': "We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real."
*'''Najix''': "All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth."
*'''Najix''': "All right kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you nobody has ever gotten the executives to un-cancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody."

==Prominence==
