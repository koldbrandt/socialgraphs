'''[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s unnamed relatives''' first appear in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]". They are the parents of [[Fred Cartman]] and probably [[Eric Cartman]]'s uncle and aunt.

==Background==
They are first seen inside [[Mabel Cartman|Cartman's grandmother]]'s house at the beginning of the episode, while Liane introduces the family to [[the boys]], for some reason she did not introduce these two, so their names are unknown, they are probably [[Eric Cartman|Eric]]'s uncle and aunt. They later appear at the end of the episode in prison with the rest of the family singing to [[Charles Manson]]. Only one of them has a line in the episode.

They later appear in "[[Cartmanland]]" at Mabel Cartman's funeral.

==Appearance==
Cartman's first unnamed relative (probably aunt) wears a light green long-sleeved shirt under a green apron and has big blond hair, she also wears pink lipstick and black shoes. The Cartman's other unnamed relative (probably uncle) wears a white shirt under a dark pink coat with a brown collar, black pants and black shoes. Like the rest of the Cartman family they are very obese.

During the funeral in "[[Cartmanland]]", the woman wore similar clothing, only with a gray shirt and a black apron and wore a veil over her face. The man also wore a black coat with a gray collar and blue jeans. They had a slightly different appearance in this episode.

==Prominence==
*"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]" - First appearance but their names are not mentioned
*"[[Cartmanland]]" - Appear at [[Mabel Cartman]]'s funeral

==Trivia==
*They are not in the episode script, which indicates that they were placed after the characters' lines were finished and that is why Liane did not quote them.
