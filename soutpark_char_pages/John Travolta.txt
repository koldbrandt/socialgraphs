'''John Travolta''' is an American actor and a practitioner of Scientology. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[The Entity]]".

==Background==
===Role===
Travolta made his first appearance in "[[The Entity]]", as a celebrity endorser for [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s new transportation device called the [[IT]]. Travolta's more prominent appearance, however, was in the episode "[[Trapped in the Closet]]". After [[Stan Marsh]] was stated to be the re-incarnation of Scientology creator [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[Tom Cruise]] rushes to Stan's side in the hope that his acting pleased Hubbard. However, when informed that is acting is merely "okay", Cruise locks himself in Stan's closet and refuses to come out despite Stan, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], the police, and [[Nicole Kidman]] asking him to "come out the closet". Travolta, a fellow Scientologist, and friend of Cruise is asked to try and coax him out, Cruise instead invites him inside the closest. The two remain inside the closet along with [[R. Kelly]], refusing to come out of the closest until Stan openly calls Scientology a scam. Travolta next appeared as his character, "Terl", from the film ''Battlefield Earth'' in "[[The Gauntlet]]", a parody of ''[[The Gauntlet|Gladiator]]'' created for the MTV Movie Awards. Travolta later appeared in "[[200]]", in which [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Rob Reiner]] lead all the celebrities who were ever insulted in South Park in a class-action lawsuit.

===References Throughout the Series===
In "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]", [[Eric Cartman]] says that finding the frozen man is just like "That one John Travolta movie," describing the plot of ''Grease''. When [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] describes his recent bump in popularity in "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]", [[God]] says, ''"Yea, like John Travolta before you, you are experiencing a second revival"''. In "[[A Million Little Fibers]]", [[Oprah Winfrey]] is seen booking Travolta on her show. In "[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] asks the [[Mark Cotswolds]] if he has ''"some kind of John Travolta disease"'', referencing Travolta's film, ''The Boy in the Plastic Bubble''.

==Appearance==
In "[[The Entity]]", Travolta had regular lips, as opposed to the very thick ones he had in "[[Trapped in the Closet]]". He wore a blue shirt with two front pockets, a white undershirt, and blue pants. In "[[Trapped in the Closet]]", he wore an unbuttoned, black coat, a dark brown shirt, a silver-buckled, black belt, and black pants.
