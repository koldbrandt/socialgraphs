'''John Elway''' was the star quarterback for the [[Denver Broncos]] football team from 1983 to 1998. His first appearance in ''[[South Park]]'' was alongside the rest of the Denver Broncos in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]].”

==Background==
A statue of John Elway stands in the park, as seen in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]". In the episode, when the parents have all been run out of town, the kids decide that John Elway is their "provider" and sacrifice each other in order to "please" it. In "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] re-imagines the events of "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", with John Elway as his father, as opposed to his mother being his father. In "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]", Butters was shown to be a John Elway fan. His retirement from football is mentioned by [[Jimbo]] in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]".

==Appearance==
In "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]", he appeared in a photograph wearing the former Denver Broncos' uniform: a #7 orange football jersey and blue helmet with orange and white stripes near in its middle. In "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", a presumably stone statue or him appeared, once again in a Denver Broncos uniform. The statue looked as if it was preparing to throw a football.
