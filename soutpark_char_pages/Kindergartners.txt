==Teachers and Classroom==
[[File:Classroom 2.png|thumb|225x225px|The Kindergartners' classroom]]
The Kindergarten class was run by [[Herbert Garrison]] after he was demoted for being a homosexual. The classroom has one round table and a chalkboard. Mr. Garrison is shown to talk about rather odd subjects to the kindergartners. He has mentioned [[Fourth Grade|having a nervous breakdown and going up into the mountains]], and also his relationship with his father in which they still have skeletons in the closet.

The class has also been taught Sex Education by Mr. Garrison, who taught them how to put a condom on and different sexual positions. At the end of [[Proper Condom Use|the episode]] Chef stated that sex education could be taught by anyone. It could be taught by [[Mr. Mackey|someone who doesn't know]], [[Ms. Choksondik|someone who has a bad opinion of it]], or even [[Herbert Garrison|a complete pervert]].

The new kindergarten teacher was Ms. Stevenson as shown in ''[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]''. Ms. Stevenson and [[Ike Broflovski]] developed a sexual relationship. They couldn't be accepted so they both decided to kill themselves by jumping off a building. After some advice from Kyle, Ike stopped just before the jump but Ms. Stevenson jumped to her death while calling "Ike?".

==Class President Elections==
In "[[Trapper Keeper]]", Mr. Garrison held an election for class president. It was between Ike and [[Filmore]]. It came to a tie and Flora who had the deciding vote, but couldn't choose.

The next day she chose Ike but Filmore's side stated there was an absent kid. He later came in from hospital and chose Filmore which made the vote a tie yet again.

Filmore then got his aunt Rosie O' Donnell involved, who Mr. Garrison mistook for a monster. She then tried to make the vote clear and eventually more people came along campaigning against different sides. Both sides hired lawyers but in the end, Filmore declined, making Ike class president.

=="[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"==
When all the kids in town said their parents "molestered" them, the parents were arrested and the kids took over the town. They believed their provider was a giant [[John Elway]] statue. The town split in half, which apparently angered the statue, so therefore, a human sacrifice would be made to it from which ever side that didn't have "the book". The kindergartners were on the same side [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Timmy]]. Their side was named "Treasure Cove". The enemy side was run by the "mayor", [[Eric Cartman]], who named his side "Smiley Town". After a couple arrived in Smiley Town/Treasure Cover, they convinced the kids to allow their parents to be released. It is assumed every kindergartner was reunited with his or her parents.

==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==
Six Kindergarteners can be seen in the park, where they play Hide and Seek with the player, and when the player finds them all, they befriend him. A group of Kindergarteners can be seen with their own faction, the Pirates, led by Ike (who refers to himself as "The Pirate King") and the player can battle them optionally.
