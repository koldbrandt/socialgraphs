The '''Recorder Concert Coordinator''' appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]".

==Background==
The job scope of the coordinator is to manage the "Four Million Child Blow 2000" recorder concert held in Arkansas, as well as the participating schools and students. 

On the night before the concert, she picks up a musical score that was edited by [[the boys]] (having added [[The Brown Note]] to take revenge on the [[New York Kids]]), thinking that the revision was done by [[Yoko Ono]]. She then instructs the concert crew to reprint and distribute the updated scores to all participants. This eventually led to a defecation incident worldwide when the participants play the brown note.

==Appearance==
The Recorder Concert Coordinator has long, curled brown hair, and wears an orange jacket over a white shirt, brown skirt, and black shoes. She is seen carrying a clipboard and a headphone set.
