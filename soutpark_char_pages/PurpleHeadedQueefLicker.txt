'''PurpleHeadedQueefLicker''', whose real name is unknown, was an internet troll who first appears in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Wieners Out]]".

In "[[Wieners Out]]", he is seen briefly at a once undisclosed location when [[Dildo Shwaggins]] brings [[Gerald Broflovski]] to the secret troll meeting.

In "[[Fort Collins]]", he is only seen briefly at the impromptu troll party at the [[Broflovski Residence]]. He later leaves after Gerald insists the trolls leave.

In "[[Oh, Jeez]]", he is captured by [[TrollTrace.com]] after believing he had been hired by [[Hillary Clinton]] to infiltrate and sabotage the service.
