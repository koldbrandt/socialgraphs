'''Vladimir Putin''' is the current President of [[Russia]]. He first appears in the [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Free Willzyx]]".

==Background==
In "[[Free Willzyx]]", he receives a phone call from [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] asking if Russia can send his whale to the moon, which was declined because Putin asked for $20,000,000.

He appears as one of the world leaders in "[[Pinewood Derby]]", agreeing to nuke [[Finland]] after its leader [[Matti Vanhanen]] plans to inform the [[Intergalactic Police]] about the "space cash" stolen on board [[Kevern Zaksor|Baby Fark McGee-zax's]] ship.

He later appears in "[[Members Only]]", where he is seen speaking to an adviser about [[TrollTrace.com]]. Concerned that his girlfriend will see all of his internet history, he declares that the service must be stopped. He receives a phone call from the [[White House]] expecting the President but instead speaks to several Memberberries reminiscing about the cold war.

He makes yet another appearance in "[[Franchise Prequel]]", where [[Stephen Stotch]] [[List of Groundings|grounds]] both him and Butters.

==Appearance==
