'''Terrance Mephesto''' is a member of the boys' class and rival to the main boys. He debuted in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]" and has made occasional cameos since.

Although Terrance has never been seen inside the boys' classroom outside of his debut episode, he frequently appears in the background. In "[[Lice Capades]]", he is seen in a different line to the main fourth grade class; as it is known that there is at least one [[The Other 4th Grade|other fourth grade]] classroom, this may explain his absence from [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class.

==Appearance==
Terrance wears a purple jacket with a black necktie and yellow suspenders attached to a pair of orange slacks. His hair and eyebrows are dark brown and he has a prominent chin. His eyebrows are of a peculiar shape, being jagged, unusually thick, and forming a monobrow. He still has his unusual eyebrows in current seasons, but they can only be seen when he's scared or angry, they also seem to have gotten smaller.

==Personality==
Terrance appears to have an abrasive personality, actively seeking out conflict in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]". He also appears to be incredibly arrogant and self-centered; when his father warns him about the danger his clone poses to the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], he exclaims "They're all stupid anyway!". Terrance also disparagingly calls the other boys "dumbasses" and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] a "plebeian", showing his arrogant demeanor. Each of these insults suggests he believes himself to be more intelligent than his classmates.

==Family==
===[[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]]===
In "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]", Terrance is shown to be [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]]'s son, although he never appears with his father again, nor is he mentioned as such. Since his mother never appears, it is possible he lives with her. Terrance appears to have a good relationship with his father, who happily helps his son with his science project of cloning a human.

It is not known what relationship Terrance has with [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto#Kevin|Kevin]], Dr. Mephesto's constant companion.

==Interactions==
===[[Bill Allen]] and [[Fosse McDonald]]===
Terrance is accompanied almost constantly by [[Bill]] and [[Fosse]] in "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]". The pair are assumed to be part of Terrance's cabal, but they have yet to appear as a group since. Terrance was quite clearly the brains of the group; Bill and Fosse did nothing but follow him around and remark that things were "pretty gay".

===[[The Boys]]===
In his debut episode, Terrance, Bill, and Fosse appeared as a group rivaling [[The Boys|the boys]], betting that they could clone a human before the boys could crossbreed an elephant and a pig.

His group's role as a rival to the boys was usurped by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and [[Craig's Gang|his gang]] in later episodes.

===[[Red]]===
[[Red]] and Terrance are seen sitting together in "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]" and "[[Trapper Keeper]]".

==Trivia==
*Terrance was scheduled to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' but was cut out of the game, it is unknown what his role would be in the game. His friend icon can be found in the game files. He had the same eyebrow models from [[Damien]] on his icon in an old game build. It is also called "Terrence" in the game files.
*He still has his unusual eyebrows in current seasons, although they rarely appear. The last time he was seen with them was in "[[The Problem with a Poo]]".
*Despite his deceased status, Terrance continues to make background appearances following his alleged death ("[[Mecha Streisand]]") and confirmed death (''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''). It is unknown whether this is simply an oversight on the animators' part or if he was revived off-screen.
**Similarly, he appeared in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]'' using the voice in the likes of [[Bill Allen|Bill]] and [[Fosse McDonald|Fosse]].
