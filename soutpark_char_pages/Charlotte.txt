Butters and Charlotte hold hands and bond while sitting on the swing in the backyard. The family moves back to Canada once they hear the President is dead and Charlotte promises to Skype Butters when she gets home. She followed through on this in "[[Tweek x Craig]]". While in a Skype call with Butters in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", she ensures that he will be careful with the recent events.

In "[[Wieners Out]]", she is seen briefly, again in a Skype call with Butters. Due to the recent protest against the boys by the girls in "[[Skank Hunt]]", she also had joined the cause.
