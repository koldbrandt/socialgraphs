'''Mrs. Miller''' was [[Billy Miller]]'s mother who appeared in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]".

==Background==
[[Eric Cartman]] successfully overthrows Billy as head of the [[Kentucky Fried Chicken|KFC]] smuggling operations, by informing his parents that Billy scored an F on his social studies test. His mother is seen entering their base, looking upset and calling out Billy.

Cartman's addiction to KFC gets the better of him, keeping him from doing proper work for [[Colonel Sanders]]. In response, the Colonel mobilizes his goon squad to deal with Cartman's faction, who in turn face interception by the police, resulting in a massive gun fight. Billy's mother was eventually caught in the middle and killed.

==Appearance==
Mrs. Miller wears a purple sweater over a white collared shirt, a purple skirt, and a bead necklace.
