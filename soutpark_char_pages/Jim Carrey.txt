'''James Eugene "Jim" Carrey''' is a Canadian-American actor famous for his comedic roles. He appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[You're Getting Old]]".

==Background==
Carrey's new movie, ''Mr. Popper’s Penguins'', seemed to have a terrible comedy plot, according to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] as he watched the film preview at the cinema. Carrey had no speaking role but rather danced around with penguin-shaped pieces of feces.

==Appearance==
Carrey has brown hair and eyebrows and was seen dressed in a blue shirt and black pants. Despite being a Canadian American, he was not drawn with Canadian features, likely to make more him recognizable.
