'''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy''' is a show where five "gay guys" called "The Fab Five" go help straight guys to learn how to dress and act. They appeared in [[Season Seven]] episode "[[South Park is Gay!]]". In reality, they are [[Crab People]].

==Appearance==
Their costumes are that of various male homosexuals. Their true appearance shares the same, crab-like humanoid body. All Crab People appear to be uniquely shaded, from "dirty" yellow to red.

==Personality==
In costume, they act in the standard gay stereotype; having feminine voices, being obsessed with fashion, etc. Out of costume, they are despicable creatures, obsessed with overtaking humanity. They also appear to be unintelligent, thinking that dressing up someone as a crab person will make them as physically weak as one.
