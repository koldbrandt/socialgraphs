'''Jo Frost''' is a professional nanny and host of the program ''Supernanny''. She appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, "[[Tsst]]".

==Background==
In "[[Tsst]]", after [[Stella Reid]] failed to cure [[Eric Cartman]], [[Liane Cartman]] hired Nanny Frost to help her control her son [[Eric Cartman|Eric]]'s behavior. She was initially confident, declaring, "There's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time, you're going to see a new Eric Cartman!" but she too failed.

Three days hence, Frost was institutionalized at Slater-Carey Mental Hospital, where she now spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. Between mouthfuls of defecate, she screams that Cartman comes from [[hell]].

==Appearance==
She appears in a purple cardigan and dress and wears rectangular glasses. She appears slightly overweight and has a mole on her left cheek. She is also at one point seen with a parasol patterned with the colors of the Union Jack. Like many British characters, she is shown to have bad teeth.

After being institutionalized, she is seen in a white mental patient's uniform, with messed up hair and covered in her own feces.

==Trivia==
*In the opening title sequence to ''Supernanny'', Frost is seen with numerous [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] children, including [[Heidi Turner]], [[Millie Larsen]], [[Pete Thelman]], and [[Damien Thorn|Damien]]. This makes sense considering the fact that all the children in South Park have a criminal record and receive extremely lenient punishments.
