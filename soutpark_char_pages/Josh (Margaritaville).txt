'''Josh''' is a man who works at the [[Big Orange Finance Company]] in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Margaritaville]]".

==Background==
When [[Stan Marsh]] tries to return a Margaritaville brand margarita maker that his [[Randy Marsh|father]] bought, the first place he goes to is [[Sur la Table]], where the store clerk, [[Caine]], tells him that he must go to the Big Orange Finance Company if he wants to return it. When Stan arrives at the finance company, he is sent in to talk to the boss named Josh, who tells him that he can't return it to them and must go to Wall Street due to the Margaritaville being bought with a payment plan, much to Stan's annoyance.

He also has a possible girlfriend or wife, as two pictures of a blonde woman can be seen in his office, including one with them riding a jet ski together.

==Appearance==
Josh has spiked brown hair, brown eyebrows, and has a noticeably orange tan on his skin. He wears a light blue collared shirt, a black belt, light gray pants, and black shoes. He is seen dipping his fingers in Carmex and putting it on his lips. He also seems to have a habit of ending most of his sentences with "Yeah. No."
