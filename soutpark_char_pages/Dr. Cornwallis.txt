'''Dr. Cornwallis''' is a goat character who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode "[[Douche and Turd]]".

==Background==
When [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] ends up at [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'s compound for animals after being exiled from [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] for refusing to vote, he is given an ultimatum to join PETA or die. However, the main leader of the group says that Stan has to get permission from Dr. Cornwallis to stay there. After entering Dr. Cornwallis' tent, he discovers that Dr. Cornwallis is actually a goat. Stan just stands there speechless. Knowing that he is just an animal and therefore cannot really talk, Stan does not even bother asking if he can stay. After walks out of the tent, he lies to all the other members saying that their leader said yes, to which all of PETA foolishly believe.

Later on, Dr. Cornwallis is seen munching on the brain of a dead PETA member after [[P. Diddy]] and his friends shoot up the compound.

==Appearance==
Dr. Cornwallis takes the appearance of a usual goat, with white colored fur, brown horns, and crossed eyes.
