The '''Inuit''' are native Canadians that appear in "[[Royal Pudding]]".

==Background==
In "[[Royal Pudding]]", the Inuit helped [[Ugly Bob]], [[Ike Broflovski]], and [[Scott the Dick]] find the princess. At first, Scott thought that the Inuit had taken the princess, however, the Native Canadians told the group that they hadn't, but knew who had: [[Tooth Decay]].

Scott said he once paid an Inuk to give him a blowjob once, but all she did was rub her nose on his penis for 45 seconds and ask him to pay up.

In "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", when [[Wendy Testaburger]] writes about intelligent dolphins, [[Eric Cartman]] says "If Dolphins are so intelligent, why do they live in igloos?", confusing dolphins with Inuit. Cartman then says "Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie crap!"

==Trivia==
*The Eskimos speak Navajo instead of their traditional language.
*In Canada, 'Eskimo' is a derogatory term to refer to the Inuit as it effectively means "eaters of raw meat", though it is a corrupted word that comes from similar Algonquian derivatives. This reinforces Scott the Dick's prejudicial tendencies when he referred to the Inuit characters as 'Eskimos'.
