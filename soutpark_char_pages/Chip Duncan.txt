'''Chip Duncan''' was a townsperson in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] who appeared in the episode "[[Sons A Witches]]".

==Background==
Chip Duncan participated in a special annual Halloween event with the other men in town wherein they would dress like witches, smoke crack, and hex their wives. During a spellbook reading, Chip recited a hex that turned him into a real witch. He kidnapped several children, including [[Heidi Turner]], before being killed by a laser fired from a satellite by order of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]].

==Appearance==
Chip has blonde hair and some stubble. After turning into a witch, his appearance changed dramatically. His blonde hair grew long and raggedy, his chin and nose became distorted, and blemishes appeared on his face like that of a typical witch. Under his eyes was a vibrant, green glow, and a permanent smile was plastered across his face that gave him an even more menacing appearance.

He wore traditional witch attire: a pointy hat, robe, gloves and boots. The robe became tattered during his witch transformation and he carried around an old broom which he used for transportation.

==Trivia==
*In the commentary for the episode, Matt and Trey state that they considered having one of the kids' dads be the 'evil witch' but decided to use a new character instead, creating Chip Duncan.
*He and Garrison are the only members of the Crack and Jack Witch Week group who are not known to have children.
