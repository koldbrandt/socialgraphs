'''Sir Roderick David Stewart''' is a British rock and pop singer, songwriter and record producer. He makes his first appearance in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]".

==Background==
In the episode, to welcome the new millennium, [[Jesus Christ]] gets Rod Stewart to perform a New Year's concert in [[Las Vegas]] and invites everyone. Jesus visits Stewart at his mansion in preparation for the concert and is welcomed by his agent. When Stewart is brought in by [[Nurse with Red Hair|his nurse]], Jesus is shocked to see the state he is in. He is wheelchair-bound, barely able to mumble his words, and suffers from fecal incontinence where he frequently "poops his pants". He is very dependent on his nurse who treats him in a very undignified, condescending manner.

At the millennium concert, Stewart is barely able to sing; he can only mumble "O-oh". He soils himself again and his nurse comes on stage to attend to him. The audience gets very upset and prepares to crucify Jesus once more.

Rod Stewart also appears in the background of "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" as one of the celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

==Appearance==
He looks very elderly, with an extreme amount of facial wrinkles, sunken-in cheeks, liver spots, as well as being confined to a wheelchair. He wears a black coat with a marble-like pattern of white streaking through it and a purple shirt.
