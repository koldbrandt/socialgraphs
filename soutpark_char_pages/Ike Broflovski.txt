{{Featured Winner|May 2010, October 2012|2}}
'''Sir Ike Moisha Broflovski''', born as '''Peter Gintz''', is [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s adopted younger brother from [[Canada]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]". His voice has been provided by many children, usually relatives of show personnel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/329817845280161792|title=''You may notice Ike's voice changes depending on the episode. That's bc Ike's voice is done by various staff members' kids.''|publisher=@SouthPark on Twitter.com}}</ref> due to their young-sounding voice, as described during the commentary of "[[Trapper Keeper]]". He has also been mistaken for both a trash can and a table post, as well as compared to a football. Unlike other Canadians, Ike doesn't have a Canadian accent or a box-shaped body, although that could be because he is so young and has presumably lived in the United States for a majority of his life.

==Background==
[[File:5a.jpg|thumb|left|Ike on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Ike was adopted by [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] and [[Sheila Broflovski]]. Ike's birth parents, [[Harry and Elise Gintz]] (who christened Ike "Peter") gave him up for adoption because Canada had been "devastated by the Cola Wars" and as a result, they were unable to raise a child.

This fact was introduced after the flappy heads and beady eyes were established as Canadian traits in the world of South Park. Since Ike was designed with both, [[Matt Stone|Matt]] and [[Trey Parker|Trey]] decided to make Ike Canadian by birth, and therefore, adopted.

In the fourth season, it is revealed that Ike is a genius, and is sent to kindergarten early. This wasn't evident at first however, Proof of Ike's genius is visible in many later episodes. He composes sheet music, reads John Steinbeck, and watches "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" every night. In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he expertly played the harmonica when Kyle hid him in the attic, and in "[[Smug Alert!]]", Ike finished several of Kyle's sentences when the boys tried to tell their father that he is becoming alienated from his friends. In the same episode, when offered LSD, Ike asked for "3 hits". He also once made a perfect replica of Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper" painting out of macaroni as a project for his Jewish camp, which completely offended his unimpressed troop leader. In "[[About Last Night...]]", he is seen helping [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] steal the Hope Diamond, as a demolition specialist and computer hacker. He can play the piano very well in "[[Fatbeard]]" and seems to know how to drive a boat.

In "[[Stanley's Cup]]", the South Park Pee-Wee hockey team hires Ike to join their team based solely on the fact that he is Canadian. To the other members of the Pee-Wee team, Ike seems to be a very good player, due to the fact that he can hit pucks into the goal, while the other members can't.

Ike is at times very aware of things going on around him, from trying to reconcile with his brother to auditioning for [[Eric Cartman]]'s [[Fingerbang|boy band]] and flipping Cartman off when he doesn't make the cut. Ike was also aware of how unpopular he initially was with his kindergarten classmates, who were jealous of the fact that he was admitted at only age three. However, he rallied enough support to force a tie in the election for class president, finally winning when his opponent (who was fed up with all the negotiations and meddling by his aunt Rosie O'Donnell) conceded defeat.

Ike has falsely attempted suicide twice, once in "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]" and again in "[[About Last Night...]]" (but that was only to get to the hospital computers when he was hired by both [[John McCain|McCain]] and [[Barack Obama|Obama]]).

In the episode "[[Fatbeard]]" Ike joins Cartman's pirate crew and goes to Somalia with him because he grew tired of his home life. However, when he and Butters hear the story of a real Somalian pirate, who tells them they shouldn't want to be a pirate and that they should be happy with their lives in America, he wants to go home again. This is one of the first episodes where Ike's dialogue is actively coherent to the audience throughout the entire episode as opposed to nonsensical comments.

Kyle is known to punt Ike like a football after saying, "Kick the baby!", to which Ike responds, "Don't kick the (goddamn) baby!"

Because he's a genius, Ike was accepted into kindergarten at the age of 3. There, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] nominates him for class president, Ike's opponent being [[Filmore]]. The vote is tied, as a little classmate of theirs named "Flora" (spoofing Florida's role in the 2000 US Presidential Election) can't make up her mind and [[Rosie O'Donnell|Filmore's aunt]] shows up to demand that Filmore be declared class president. Eventually, Filmore gives up and Ike becomes class president (to which he can only exclaim (loudly), "I pooped my pants!").

At one point, Ike has an affair with his kindergarten teacher, Ms. Stevenson, during which he loses his virginity, becoming the youngest person on the show to do so. They planned to run off to Milan (to which Ike replies, "Yay, Mulan!", confusing Milan with the Disney character [[Mulan]]). Before they leave, Kyle helps him come back to his senses. As Ike and his teacher are on the roof of a hotel, they both run to the edge, but Ike skids to a stop. Ms. Stevenson doesn't and leaps to her death.

In a plot involving his Canadian heritage, the Canadian Prime Minister, with the help of the Canadian critic (and [[Terrance and Phillip]] nemesis) [[Scott the Dick]], passed a new law forcing Canadian parents to take back children they put up for adoption; this included Ike's birth parents. However, when the Prime Minister was revealed to be [[Saddam Hussein]], his new laws were repealed, and Ike went back to his adopted family.

In the episode "Stanley's Cup", Ike is on a Pee-Wee hockey team coached by [[Stan Marsh]]. He joins the team simply because of the fact that he is Canadian, and thus as a stereotype must be a superior hockey player. During a practice session, he demonstrated shooting skills far beyond those of his teammates. According to Kyle, Ike was not allowed to play because of how dangerous it was and their mother's fears, yet Stan promises that Ike will be okay. However, the team plays in place of the Colorado Avalanche since their intended Pee-Wee opponents didn't show up, and Ike, along with the other children, was injured badly by the Detroit Red Wings.

Ike can sing as well, as seen in the episodes "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", where he auditions for the boy band, and "[[Erection Day]]", where Ike sings 'The Yankee Doodle Boy' in the talent show.

In the episode "[[Canada on Strike]]", Ike is shown standing up for Canada and holding a sign with the words "Honk if you support Canada".

Ike has a more grown-up dialogue in "[[Dead Celebrities]]", not speaking with his normal childlike voice.

Also in the episode "[[About Last Night...]]" he is the last member of Obama's team to act in their plot, by faking an injury because [[John McCain]] lost, and while he was in the hospital, he performed his tasks by destroying a plane filled with decoys of the presidential candidates and hacking into the hospital's computer to type in Obama and his team deceased, showing a high level of intellect and computer skills.

In "[[Royal Pudding]]", Ike dresses up as in a school play but is crying over the kidnapping of the Princess of Canada. Ike is shown having a Canadian Faith Box, which appears quite old. Ike may have acquired this with his birth or by his biological parents, who took him back to Canada for a short time. In the same episode, Ike is knighted by the princess after he rescues her.

During [[Season Twenty]], Ike is being constantly used by his father to troll under the name of [[Skankhunt42]] when he is stuck in [[Denmark]], because of the fact he is too young for someone to believe him. In "[[Members Only]]", as Gerald guides him to put a penis in a woman's mouth, his mother finds out and assumes he is the Skankhunt. When she contacts her husband, he ditches Ike and acts like Ike is the real troll. As he is being sat on the corner, Kyle realizes that it wasn't him but their father. Until "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]" when Sheila finds out Ike wasn't really the troll using [[TrollTrace.com]], Ike and Kyle try multiple times to run away or use the computer for several reasons until driving their mother completely insane, and finally locking her in the pantry to finish the job.

===Name===
According to his [[Harry and Elise Gintz|birth parents]] in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", Ike's birth name is Peter Gintz. In "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]", it is revealed that his full name is Ike Moisha Broflovski, as written on his grave. Ike is short for the Hebrew name Isaac.

==Appearance==
Ike is easily recognized by his baby body, small beady eyes, the standard flopping Canadian head, and a short tuft of black hair. He wears a blue onesie, with white ovals on the bottom of the feet area. Instead in "[[Insecurity]]" and "[[Christmas Snow]]" he wears a white onesie with pink trim, blue cuffs and pink, yellow and blue circles (similar to [[Butters Stotch]]'s). He has also been shown wearing a green shirt with a boat on it and black shorts. It is mentioned in "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" that he has freckles. Unlike most [[Canada|Canadians]], Ike has a visible nose.

==Personality==
Ike appears to idolize his older brother. He has often tried to follow him to school as shown in "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" and "[[Cancelled]]". He often copies the words Kyle has said, even obscenities, as shown in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Conversely, one of the few examples of Ike getting angry at Kyle occurred when Kyle interrupted Ike's news program and changed the channel. Kyle has superficial malice towards Ike, but in several episodes, most notably "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]," it's shown that Kyle does indeed love his brother. In "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]", Ike was angry with Kyle because he tried to break up his relationship with the Kindergarten teacher. Furthermore, he is clearly heard saying, "You are dead to me, Kyle!"

Ike often tries to pronounce words but fails. However, in the episode "[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]", he can say, "penis" and "vagina" quite clearly and in "[[Cancelled]]" he tells Kyle to "suck my balls". Despite his intelligence, Ike often replies to questions with random answers. Some of Ike's random statements are ''"cookie monster,"'' ''"Ring Around the Rosie,"'' ''"I pooped my pants,"'' ''"I don't like medicine,"'' and various nonsensical burbling. Statements like these tend to serve as catch-all phrases and non sequitur answers to questions Ike is asked. Even in a heated argument with Kyle in "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy," Ike can clearly be heard saying, "Ring Around the Rosie!" in an angry tone.

==Family==

===[[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] and [[Gerald Broflovski]]===

Ike is the adopted child of Sheila and Gerald Broflovski. They have been shown to love him very much, becoming extremely upset when he was taken back to Canada in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]". He seems to love them as well, originally not wanting to go back to Canada with his biological parents.

===[[Harry and Elise Gintz]]===

Harry and Elise are Ike's birth parents. In "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", they are shown to love Ike very much. However, this love is one-sided; Ike doesn't seem to love them back.

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===

Ike is the younger, adopted brother of Kyle. He seems to idolize Kyle, copying his words and actions. They have had falling outs before; however, as of recent seasons, they seem to be on good terms, however, on [[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]], their relationship has become very strained because of Ike having a sexual relationship with his kindergarten teacher and which cause Kyle to tell Cartman and have her arrested, much to Ike's anger.

*At the end of "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", he managed to get his hands on the [[Diamond of Pantheos]], and transformed into Mecha-Ike. The ramifications of this are unknown, and everything was back to normal by the next episode.

*Ike in "[[Taming Strange]]" is shown to have a slight Canadian accent, most likely due to the fact he has lived in South Park most of his life.

*In [[REHASH|#REHASH]] and [[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]], Ike likes to watch PewDiePie and ignores Kyle when he informs him that he got the new Call of Duty, telling him 'Maybe later, okay?' to watch PewDiePie playing CoD Advanced Warfare.
*Ike has watched ''Naruto'' on CrunchyRoll, searched up 'Undertale' and 'Yuuri on Ice', viewed 'Chinpokomon Sun & Moon', and streamed ''The Amazing World of Gumball'', as shown on his browsing history in "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]".

*Ike was originally going to follow [[The Boys]] to the battlefield scene of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', as it was seen in early trailer footage and promotional screencaps of the film.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Ike is seen in his pirate costume from Fatbeard in the playground at the Kids' Park. If the player interacts with him, he will yell "I am a pirate king!". Ike doesn't react if the player attacks or farts on him. 

When battling with Kyle, the famous "Kick the Baby" is used as an attack. When laying siege to Clyde's fortress, Ike tries to launch a firework but is stopped by a cyclops. The player can launch the firework for him (which kills the Cyclops) and Ike befriends him. Kyle's first ability, (Summon Elemental) features Ike, where the player must hold down a button while Kyle is charging up, then when he lights up, they let go of the button. If done correctly, Ike will fly at the opponent holding two knives.

During the game's early design changes Ike one draft had a design to have him be a dwarf, which a boss fight would've occurred of him riding a bat with a background taken place in a cave. A second Elf Warrior design for Kyle's first move, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Ufja-ljUc&feature=youtu.be&t=107 (Summon Elemental)], had him be an elf warrior though this was changed back to the Maplebeard design used in the open world.

Another draft had Ike riding a long mower as a dragon for a boss against the new kid at the battle of Kyle's backyard. This would've happened after the new kid defeated Bill and Fosse to rescue Wendy (referring to her as a witch.)

During one of the last drafts Ike would've requested the player to visit Canada instead of the girls, when recruiting them for Clyde's fortress. Reason being explained by one of the pirates, "He wants the Canadian Government to adjust its fiscal spending to compensate for the 10 percent decrease in jobs for the education system in the seven provinces of Canada."
