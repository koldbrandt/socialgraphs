'''Scuzzlebutt''' is a basket-weaving monster who lives on top of a mountain in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He has a piece of celery as an arm and [[Patrick Duffy]] as a leg. He appears prominently in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Volcano]]". He has had several cameo appearances since.

==Background==
[[File:Volcano055.png|thumb|left|Cartman as Scuzzlebutt.]]
In "[[Volcano]]", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tells the story of Scuzzlebutt to scare his friends, depicting him as a vicious monster, though they do not believe him. In order to scare them even more, Cartman dresses up as Scuzzlebutt. This plan failed and Cartman was almost shot.

Eventually, a volcano erupted and Cartman and the others were trapped, as the town built a trench to divert the lava away from the town. This is when Scuzzlebutt appears for real, much to Cartman's surprise, and weaves a wicker basket that saves the children. Shortly after, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] kills Scuzzlebutt to prove to his [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo]] that he is a good nephew, but that pretty much failed.

In "[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]", in-keeping with the re-imagined versions of the flashback sequences in that episode, Scuzzlebutt instead weaves some ice cream and has Brent Musburger for a leg instead of Patrick Duffy.

At the end of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Scuzzlebutt is seen in the crowd on the right while everyone is singing the "[[Mountain Town (Reprise)|Mountain Town reprise]]" despite the fact that he was killed way before the [[American-Canadian War]].

==Appearance==
Skuzzlebutt is a large brown creature with Patrick Duffy as a leg and a celery stick for an arm. He has dark brown hair and a dark brown beard.

==Personality==
He is a kind, sweet-natured creature with a basic grasp of the English language, as he is shown able to say the words "friend" and "Volcano". He is reclusive but unafraid of humans. He is benevolent and thoughtful, as he is shown saving the boys in a wicker basket and giving some freshly-picked mountain flowers to [[Mayor McDaniels]].
