}}'''Chase''' is a character who appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[T.M.I.]]"

==Background==
Chase appears as a member of an anger management group to help control his anger, which is implied to be caused by him having a small penis. When [[Randy Marsh]] joins the group, Chase becomes part of the "Pissed Off and Angry Party" and attacks the [[FedEx Office]] with his fellow members until the surgeon general [[Rebecca Turnod]] changes the national average for penis size.

Chase claims to get most angry at "scrawny-ass sissies".

==Appearance==
Chase wears a dark green tank top, brown shorts, black sneakers, and a pair of military dog tags. He has brown hair cut into a small triangular shape at the top and has a tattoo of the U.S. Marine Corps' [[wikipedia:Eagle,_Globe,_and_Anchor|Eagle, Globe and Anchor]] emblem on his left arm.
