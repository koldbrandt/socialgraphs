{{LinkDisambig|Sally (Disambiguation)}}
'''Sally Darson''' is a [[South Park Elementary]] student who made her debut in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]". She is a schoolyard's version of a prostitute, as she exchanges kisses for money. She is the only known member of the school [[List of South Park Cows Sports Teams#Swim Team|swim team]]. She is also seen checking out [[Larry Zewiski|Larry's]] bike in "[[Bike Parade]]".

==Background==
After [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] pays her five dollars to kiss him, he organizes her "service". After some thinking, he turns her 'idea' of paying for kisses into a very profitable business, recruiting more students for different times and places. After Butters recruits more girls, he searches for information on the internet and makes Sally his "bottom bitch". A bottom bitch is the one girl the pimp reserves for himself, usually the most senior and therefore experienced. 

When Butters expands his company to include actual prostitutes, one of the prostitutes argues with Sally over why she is the bottom bitch. It is unknown if this "business" is still active, as Butters left the "company" near the end of the episode. 

==Appearance==
Sally wears an outfit that consists of a dark pink jacket with a bright pink collar, a blue skirt, and aqua colored tights. She has her golden blonde hair done in a long ponytail with a teal tie, somewhat similar to [[Kelly ("Rainforest Schmainforest")|Kelly]].
