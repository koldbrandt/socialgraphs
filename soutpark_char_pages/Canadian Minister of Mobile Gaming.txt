'''The Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming''', also known as '''Beelzeboot''' or '''the Canadian Devil''' is a demon intent on ruining the lives of Canadians with his evil schemes.

==Background==
He appeared in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Freemium Isn't Free]]", where he created the [[Wikipedia:Freemium|freemium]] mobile game, ''[[List of Video Game References#Terrance and Phillip Give Us Your Money Mobile Game|Terrance and Phillip Give Us Your Money]]'', extracting money from gaming addicts to enrich [[Canada]]'s infrastructure. He is eventually revealed to be the Canadian Devil, Beelzeboot, and is defeated by [[Satan]]. Satan also mentions that it's not the first time Beelzeboot creates a no-brainer temptation without any sense of nuance, and there has been a struggle between them for ages because of that.

==Appearance==
[[File:Canadian Devil.png|thumb|left|The Canadian Devil.]]
The Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming, like the other Canadians, has beady eyes and a Pac-Man-like head that flaps up and down. He is balding, has brown hair and a brown mustache, and wears a gray suit with a black tie. He initially speaks with a French-Canadian accent, later switching to a normal accent before revealing his true self.

As the Canadian Devil, he resembles a smaller, Canadian version of Satan. He has red skin and dark red demon wings, his brown hair and mustache has turned black, has a black loincloth, and he has small horns atop his head and one fang in his mouth. He also carries a red pitchfork, and occasionally farts fireballs.
