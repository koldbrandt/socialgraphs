{{LinkDisambig|Thomas (Disambiguation)}}
'''Thomas Turner'''<ref name="name">"[[The Pandemic Special]]"</ref> is [[Heidi Turner]]'s father. He is a very muscular man and a stereotypical over-protective father, making sure his daughter doesn't get into any trouble. Three different versions of Mr. Turner were shown in "[[Probably]]", "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]", and "[[Marjorine]]". These errors were likely the result of Heidi's character model not being finalized, due to her status as a background character.

==Background==
==="[[Probably]]"===
Heidi's original father was shown in "[[Probably]]", attempting to take her out of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s cult. He was killed after a piece of wood fell on him.

==="[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"===
A second version of Heidi's father appeared in "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]", where he was seen hiding with [[Nancy Turner|his wife]], [[Heidi Turner|his daughter]], and, presumably, [[Boy with Blond Hair|his son]].

==="[[Marjorine]]"===
The third and current model of Heidi's father first appeared in "[[Marjorine]]", where he was watching over the girls at [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s slumber party making sure that there were no boys at the party. He looked out the window in one scene with binoculars looking straight into [[Craig Tucker]]'s Binoculars. He then yelled: "Ahaa! I knew it! Boys at the slumber party!" [[Butters Stotch]], hearing this, presumed he was talking about him, and took the "future telling device" and ran away.

He also makes small cameos in "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" during crowd scenes. He also appeared in "[[Jewpacabra]]", where he was seen at the Easter egg hunt.

==Appearance==
Mr. Turner has short, blond hair with two bangs hanging down in front. He has a blond mustache similar to that of [[Randy Marsh]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s father. He wears a green t-shirt and black pants. Mr. Turner is also very muscular.
