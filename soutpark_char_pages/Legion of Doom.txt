===Unnamed 12th Member===
The twelfth member seen in the Legion of Doom is the most physically imposing, but has been given little backstory. He is most likely based off DC comic-book villain Solomon Grundy, who was originally a Mafia member from Prohibition times who was killed in a shootout, then later transformed into a revenant when revived by dark magic.  He had also become much stupider, but this was due to decay ruining his memories of his former life. When he mentioned he "...died on Saturday", the other villains associated him with the Mother Goose rhyme of Solomon Grundy, and as such was commissioned with that name.
