'''Dr. Doctor''' ('''Dr. Horatio Gauche''' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and '''Dr. Kels''' in "[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]") is a doctor in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] known for his unusual diagnoses. He worked in [[Hells Pass Hospital]], although as of "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", he seems to own his own practice.

==Background==
He first appeared in "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]" as one of the only surgeons at Hell's Pass Hospital with [[Nurse Goodly]], working to save several patients including [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] during a blizzard. He makes [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy]], [[Eric Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Kenny McCormick]] honorary doctors. At the end of the episode they successfully manage to recuperate Mephesto so he can reveal the identity of Cartman's father.

He was one of the doctors who operated on Kenny McCormick after being lit on fire and having a load of salt dumped on him. He replaces Kenny's heart with a baked potato, and was unsuccessful with reviving Kenny. At first he was incredibly upset, but straight after his cry, he and the other doctors just walked off whistling. He also called the parents of the children telling them they went to see the [[Terrance and Phillip]] movie, causing them to be grounded and start [[Mothers Against Canada]].

In "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]", after [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is admitted to the hospital following his possession by the soul of his deceased friend, Kenny McCormick, the Doctor's diagnosis is "his time is running out", and uses that phrase as if it were a literal medical diagnosis, explaining if he doesn't get a "time transplant", he will die. In the episode "[[You Got F'd in the A]]", which is a spoof of the film 'You Got Served', the Doctor treats [[Randy Marsh]] after Randy is "served" (slang term for being beaten in a dance competition) by a group of street dancers, as if "being served" constitutes an actual physical transgression that incurs major injuries.

In "[[Pre-School]]", he treats the kids of South Park after bullying, even though they were merely the victim of mild abuse such a "second-degree titty twister." In "[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]", after Cartman is hospitalized following an attempt to fly by jumping off a roof with cardboard wings, the Doctor tells his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] that he is "incredibly stupid" and that the stupidity caused the fall.

In "[[Stanley's Cup]]", he is the doctor for [[Nelson Brown]], a young boy with cancer who plays for the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] that Stan is coaching. After the team draws with the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]], Dr. Doctor explains to Stan that Nelson is in a "cancer limbo" because neither team won. He explains that Nelson's hope that Stan will lead the team to victory is the only thing keeping him alive, and that if the team were to lose, he is sure to die.

In "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", Dr. Doctor returns, now working at his own practice, when [[Randy Marsh]] sees him for medical marijuana. He assures Randy that he's healthy, so Randy goes out of his way to get Testicular Cancer so he can smoke medical marijuana. Doctor is intelligent enough to notice the correlation between the rise in cancer and the marijuana store, but incorrectly asserts that [[KFC]] is keeping people healthy, resulting in Marijuana being banned, and KFC being re-legalized as Medicinal Fried Chicken.

In episodes such as "[[About Last Night...]]", "[[Poor and Stupid]]" and "[[You're Getting Old]]", different Doctors are shown, but Dr. Doctor reappears from time-to-time. His absence could possibly be explained by him working out of his own practice instead of Hell's Pass Hospital now.

==Appearance==
Dr. Doctor has wavy dark gray hair combed and is bigger than most other adults. He wears a white shirt under a turquoise lab coat with a badge on the right side and a stethoscope. He has no other distinguishable characteristics. During the first few seasons, his temples are a lighter shade of gray.

*Dr. Doctor is apparently a skilled heart surgeon, as he almost saves Kenny's life in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut'', only failing to do so because he replaced it with a baked potato.
*Dr. Doctor has a strong stomach, as shown in "Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut", when he sees a patient's head fall off, and hearing a needle scrape against the bone. However, everyone but Stan also tolerated it.
