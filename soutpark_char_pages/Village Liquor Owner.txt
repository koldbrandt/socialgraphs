The '''Village Liquor Owner''' is the owner of the [[South Park Village Liquor]].

==Background==
In "[[Christmas Snow]]", the owner was forced to close his store following a ban on sale of liquor during the holiday season. As he was closing the store, a group of South Park residents approached him, asking if he had any alcohol on hand. When the owner presented them a small bottle of peppermint schnapps, [[Stephen Stotch]] grabbed his shirt in frustration.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
The owner (then a background character with unknown occupation) was seen in an alternate timeline during [[Farts of Future Past]], calling out the arrival of the [[Woodland Critters]] before running away.

==Appearance==
The owner wears a green John Deere hat, a blue jacket over brown collared shirt, loose gray pants, and brown shoes.

==Prominence==
*"[[Smug Alert!]]" - Witness the smug cloud going over [[Dusty and Son's / Cookie's Diner]].
*"[[Christmas Snow]]"
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen in line waiting for a vaccine.
