'''Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer''' was an American serial killer and sex offender of men who was incarcerated in 1992 until his murder in 1994. He appeared in the episode, "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" and "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]" in the song "[[Christmas Time in Hell]]" as one of many the residents of [[Hell]].

==Background==
He was given the task of picking up [[Satan]]'s Ferrari cake, along with [[John Wayne Gacy]] and [[Ted Bundy]], but the trio fell into several Three Stooges-esque antics, with Dahmer playing the role of "Larry". He murders one of the chefs assigned to deliver the cake when asked why he did it he replied that the chef snuck up on him. When John Wayne Gacy murders a pedestrian, he claims he did it for Dahmer and when Dahmer sees this, he tears out the organs of the man and starts humping them and later starts eating the man's arm.

Eventually, the cake is destroyed and they have to bake a new one. He claims to be the only cook among the trio but left the school because there weren't enough Italian people to eat. In the ensuing altercation, Ted Bundy cuts his tongue off. In return, Dahmer stabs Bundy in the ribs and then through the roof of his mouth. Dahmer's skull is then bashed in with a rolling pin by a blinded Gacy, revealing his brain.

In "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", [[Satan]] sings a verse of the song "[[Christmas Time in Hell]]" about Dahmer buying a Christmas ham, having sex with it, and then eating it.

==Appearance==
Jeffrey Dahmer wears an orange jumpsuit, presumably from prison, over a black undershirt. He has wavy blond hair, blond eyebrows, and visible signs of stress. In "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]", he was depicted with a real picture of him pasted on a body but this was later changed to an SP-style face in "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]".

During the sequence of "[[Christmas Time in Hell]]" in "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", he wears a red sweater bearing the words "Don't open till xmas" and green pants. He also has a five-o'-clock shadow, dark brown eyebrows, and eye bags.

==Prominence==
*"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]" - Satan sings that he is buying Christmas ham, having sex with it, and eating it.
*"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"
*"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" - Him, [[John Wayne Gacy]], and [[Ted Bundy]] are ordered to bring a Ferri Cake to Satan Halloween party.

==Trivia==
*He and the other two killers were characters destined to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' but were cut in the final version. Their friend icons can still be found in the game files.
*In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", [[the boys]] speculate that [[Mr. Farnickle]] murdered his [[Mrs. Farnickle|wife]] in a very similar manner to Dahmer's M.O. (bludgeoning her to death, dismembering her body, and dissolving the remains in an acid-filled bathtub).
*He is one of few characters in ''South Park'' with significant design changes.
