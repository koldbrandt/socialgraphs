'''Pearl''' is [[South Park Elementary]]'s home economics teacher who first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".

==Background==
She dated [[Mr. Adler]] and wanted to sleep with him in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]". He refused because he had recently lost his fiancé and was mourning her death instead of moving on.

==Appearance==
She has short black hair and visible eyelashes. She wears a short-sleeved pink dress that shows her cleavage with a reddish-purple sash beneath the bust line.

==Personality==
She speaks with a soft, gentle voice and does her job with plenty of knowledge. Judging by her lessons she follows stereotypical beliefs, advising her students to choose potential suitors based on superficial, materialistic criteria such as how many credit cards they have. She is good with chat-up lines, as she is shown to come up with them and then have her students recite them in their lessons. However, these chat-up lines are inappropriate for her students as they are only children.
