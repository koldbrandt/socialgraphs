'''George Washington''' was the 1st President of the [[United States]] who appeared in the "[[Tegridy Farms (Short)|Tegridy Farms]]" short.

==Background==
[[Randy Marsh]] claims that George Washington and a few other founding fathers owned hemp farms, as they "knew the meaning of hard work and integrity." An image is shown with George Washington holding a marijuana leaf, with his left foot on another stack of weed.

A speech on drug wars and people with integrity soon followed, with Randy claiming that [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|his farm]] would donate 100% of their profits to charities that work to right the wrongs of the drug war, until weed is legal nationwide.

==Appearance==
George Washington appeared in a white-buttoned, blue coat and shirt, white blouse, and dark blue pants.
