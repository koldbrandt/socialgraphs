The '''South Park Vampire Society''' is a group of students from [[South Park Elementary]] who dress up and portray themselves as vampires. They appeared prominently in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[The Ungroundable]]" and the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]."

==Background==
The Vampire Kids are a group of kids who are fans of vampire fashion and subculture, especially the book series ''Twilight'' by Stephanie Meyer. They pretend to be vampires by wearing plastic fangs, drinking Clamato juice as a substitute for blood, and dressing in clothes from the store [[Hot Topic]]. Their Hangouts include the far side of the playground & the gymnasium.

They class themselves into the three known varieties of vampires, based on the actual vampire folklore: psy (psychic), sanguinarian (blood drinking), and hybrid (both psy and sanguinarian). However, only three known members of the clique have described themselves as such.

They go around accepting kids who they see as "cool enough" to join them, although they have allowed some the less popular kids join them on a trial basis. The [[Goth Kids]] took notice of them and became increasingly outraged by the growing size of the clique and felt that the vampire kids were ripping off their gothic style of dress and causing those of neither goth or vampire affiliation to confuse them with the other.

In an attempt to solve the problem, the Goth Kids first kidnapped the leader of the clique, [[Mike Makowski]] and FEDEX'ed him to the city of Scottsdale, thinking that getting rid of the head vampire would cause the other vampires to go back to being normal. However, the plan had no effect and the vampire clique continued to grow even larger. On the verge of accepting defeat, the goth kids were met by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who had also been among those who have been assimilated into the vampire clique. Unlike the rest of the kids however, Butters did not join because he thought of it as a fad, but instead actually believed he really was a vampire.

Wanting to free himself of his 'curse', Butters suggested the idea of destroying the vampires' lair, which would supposedly cause the vampires to become human again. He leads the Goth kids to the clothes store Hot Topic, as soon as the goth kids entered the store, they took out their cigarette lighters and cans of hairspray product, using them as makeshift flamethrowers and torched the whole store.

In "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", the Vampire Kids are holding a meeting which is interrupted by [[Goth Kids]] [[Pete]] and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]] who up until then were their sworn enemies. The Goths enlist the help of the Vampire Kids who they feel are the only other clique who understands the Emos. The Vampire leader, [[Mike Makowski]], and an [[Unnamed Black Vampire|adult Black Vampire Kid]] agree to help and during a seance they summon the spirit of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to help stop the Emos.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
The Vampire kids make an appearance at the end of the game, teaming up with Clyde's forces. During the game's beta stages, the Vamp Kids were to be fought as regular enemies at the cemetery, but were scrapped from the game, possibly due to the previous company's bankruptcy while they were planning to complete the game.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
====Background====
The Vampire Kids have gone to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] to celebrate their leader, [[Mike Makowski]]'s birthday. As [[the New Kid]] and [[Mysterion]] arrived to take their newest member, [[Karen McCormick]], back home with them, they engage in combat against them.

They hold the vampire relics needed to open the door to the VIP section, and the New Kid, alongside Mysterion, [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], and [[Henrietta Biggle]] must fight them several times.

====Tactics====
Vampire Kids run the gambit with abilities, but the first thing to know about them is that their primary attack spells have life-drain effects similar to [[Mosquito]]'s attacks. These attacks can be initiated at short or long range. However, no life-drain attack may give a Vampire Kid more HP than their maximum HP.

Healer-class Vampire kids have a telegraphed move for revival, and can both heal and revive any Vampire Swarmers on their space. Unlike other combatants, a Vampire Swarmer's body will not get up and leave the battle grid just because a player's character walks onto the space. If a Vampire Swarmer is on an occupied space when they are revived, they will move to the closest adjacent space.

==Appearance==
Members of the Vampire Society usually wear black clothing, from the Hot Topic store, and have various colored dyes in their hair. Several wear excessive amount of makeup on their faces.
