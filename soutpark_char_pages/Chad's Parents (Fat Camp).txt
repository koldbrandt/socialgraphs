'''[[Chad]]'s Parents''' appear at the end of the "[[Fat Camp]]" episode. They are seen taking Chad out of [[Hopeful Hills|camp]] because he is not losing weight, with Chad's father telling the [[Rick and Susan Tyler|counselors]] that he wants a refund. Chad however reveals to them that he was eating the sweets that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] was selling to the campers during bedtime.

Like his son, Chad's father has red hair. He wears a white shirt under a cyan jacket with orange edges and an orange collar, dark blue pants, and black shoes. Chad's mother has long brown hair and orange freckles, black eyelashes, and red lipstick. She wears a pink dress and black shoes. Like the parents of the other campers, they are grossly overweight.
