The '''Two Farmers''' are two old men at the bowling alley who are [[Randy Marsh|Steamy Ray Vaughn]]'s only audience in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[You're Getting Old]]". The old men feel compelled to steal [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s underwear in order to save them from the fate of violent farts caused by his [[Tween Wave|tween wave]] performances.

The two also appear in "[[W.T.F.]]" as part of the enthused redneck crowd who see the boys' [[Wrestling Takedown Federation|wrestling league]] and believe it.

The farmer on the left later appears being interviewed by the news, both in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[The Magic Bush]]", and the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Sponsored Content]]". He also has a conversation with [[Skeeter]] and Randy in "[[Truth and Advertising]]".

The two farmers make a cameo appearance commenting on the college [[PC Bros]] as they are partying in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Stunning and Brave]]".

They both also appear in the Season Nineteen episode, "[[The City Part of Town]]" showing the [[Whole Foods Representative]] how they slaughter cows. Both make cameo appearances in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode "[[White People Renovating Houses]]" as among the protesting rednecks, and in the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode "[[Unfulfilled]]" as [[Amazon]] employees.
