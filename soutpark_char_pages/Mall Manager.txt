The '''Mall Manager''' is the unnamed manager of the [[South Park Mall]] who first appears in the [[Season Four]] episode "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]". He often ends a sentence or conversation by pausing and asking 'What?' regardless of context.

==Background==
In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", [[The Boys]] go to the [[South Park Mall]] as their boy band [[Fingerbang]] so they can audition for the mall manager and perform at the mall. The mall manager refuses to let them perform because there is a sausage and cheese cart in the plaza and he doesn't want to move it on the side for a while. Cartman comes back later to show the manager a video they shot, but it ends up getting ruined by [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s antics. Despite this, the manager finally allows the band to perform, but tells them to get out when [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] dies before they start performing. They perform nonetheless and appear to be a hit.

He is not seen or mentioned in the "[[Black Friday]]" trilogy, and a different mall manager is seen.

==Appearance==
The mall manager has brown hair and brown eyebrows. He wears a dark green vest over a white collared shirt with a red and green tie, black pants, and black shoes. He also seems to have odd speech mannerisms, such as randomly saying "What?" and "Hey!" and acting somewhat nervous.

*He seems to be turned on by the roleplaying sex tape between [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Mr. Mackey]].
