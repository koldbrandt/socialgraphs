'''Dr. Pal''' is a doctor that came to help talk to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] about his erections in "[[Erection Day]]".

==Appearance==
Dr. Pal wears a blue collared shirt, jeans, and black shoes. He has brown hair and no facial hair. He has no other distinguishing features.

==Personality==
He seemed to be a man who tried too hard to be relatable to kids, with wacky hand gestures and lingo to embarrass Jimmy. He also asked Jimmy if they could take off their shirts and kiss, so it is revealed he is just a pedophile who just has a doctor's job to molest kids. When Jimmy refuses, Dr. Pal refuses to help, showing he does not actually care about Jimmy's problems and only wanted to molest him.
