'''Thad''' was a UPS truck driver and deliverer who appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Insecurity]]", where he delivers packages to the townsfolk of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from [[Amazon.com]].

==Background==
While Thad delivers packages in South Park, a misunderstanding brews from a drawing by [[Ike Broflovski]], depicting the "[[Gerald Broflovski|UPS Man]]" having sexual intercourse with [[Sheila Broflovski|a South Park mother]]. This misunderstanding causes all the adult men in South Park to believe that Thad is having sexual intercourse with all their wives. This leads to all the men, led by [[Randy Marsh]], to brutally beat Thad. Later, after the men blow up Thad's UPS truck and [[Wolf Home Security]] fails to act effectively, Thad jumps out a window of the [[Broflovski Residence]] to his death.

==Appearance==
Thad has blond hair. He wears a UPS uniform consisting of a brown shirt, brown pants shorts, black shoes, a black watch and a brown UPS hat. He wears a blue arm sling after his beating at the hands of the South Park adult men.
