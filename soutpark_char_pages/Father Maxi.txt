'''Father Maxi''' is a Roman Catholic priest who serves as the mouthpiece for [[South Park (Location)|South Park's]] Christian community. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and runs the [[South Park Church]]. He first appear in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]".

==Background==
Father Maxi's unwavering belief that everyone is going to [[Hell]] goes so far as that he bluntly claims that [[Timmy Burch]] would go to Hell, since Timmy cannot confess his sins, as he cannot speak anything fluently.

However, at times Father Maxi can come off as less of a fundamentalist, as in "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]" in which he grows concerned by the massive amounts of sexual abuse cases regarding priest and children and is horrified to discover that sex with children is apparently part of [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Law. When he discovers this, he makes several attempts to change the "Holy Doctrine" so that sex with children is wrong, and suggesting that priests be allowed to have sex with women.

His desire to change Vatican Law and be allowed to sleep with women may have something to do with the fact that he has apparently had sex with several women in South Park, including [[Liane Cartman]].

There are also times where he seems to know very little about religion; once, when seeing [[Jesus Christ]], he exclaimed "Hey, it's that guy from the public access show!" However, considering that Jesus actually hosts a cable access show in South Park, this is most likely done for irony purposes.

==="[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"===
When it's announced that Jesus has been removed from the Christmas play, he requests that [[Santa Claus]] and [[Frosty]] be removed as well.

==="[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"===
He has his first major role in this episode. He expresses his beliefs on whether or not the handicapped will go to Hell to the [[The Boys|boys]]. They later see him having sex with a woman in the church confessional, which gives Cartman the idea to lead his own Christian community.

==="[[Cripple Fight]]"===
Father Maxi claims he will be able to convert [[Big Gay Al]] to being straight but it is revealed he made a similar claim about a man called "Peterson" who Father Maxi himself ended up having sex with.

==="[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"===
Despite his character flaws, it was Father Maxi who, in the episode "Red Hot Catholic Love", unearthed the massive corruption behind the many church-related sexual assaults. He also forced the Catholic Church to stop letting priests molest young boys. Apparently this plan almost succeeds.

==="[[Margaritaville]]"===
Serves a semi-major role as an affiliate of [[Randy Marsh]], along with [[Skeeter]], [[Stephen Stotch]], and others, during his rebellion against the economy as an illusion to the mythologies of [[Moses]], and [[Jesus Christ]]. Ironically, he wasn't on the side of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]].

==="[[A Boy And A Priest]]"===
Father Maxi temporarily closes the church and becomes friends with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] after the churchgoers heckle him with pedophilia jokes. After Butters takes Maxi to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde's]] birthday party and the children refuse to accept Maxi's presence, Maxi cuts ties with Butters, explaining he feels guilt for knowing the Catholic Church were doing terrible things to boys and doing nothing about it. However, when the [[Catholic Cleanup Crew]] kidnaps Butters, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and Clyde, Maxi goes to save them. The crew offers to transfer him, but Maxi runs them over with a "Kumboni" as he realizes his purpose is defending the boys. He then returns to church and preaches about penance despite the continuing pedophilia jokes.

==Appearance==
Priest Maxi can sometimes be seen wearing black pants, black shoes, and a black shirt with a white roman collar. Other times he wears a black cassock and a purple stole, traditionally worn in the Catholic church during Lent and Advent. He has brown and gray hair with a hairstyle and a double chin, he also has a wart on his forehead and his eyes are slightly spread apart, and he is seen wearing black glasses. Father Maxi's appearance was lightly redone in the episode "[[A Boy And A Priest]]".

==Personality==
His personality seems somewhat flexible based on the needs of the show; often he is a narrow-minded and intolerant man who is convinced most people are going to be damned to [[Hell]], often for trivial offenses. For example, in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" he states constantly through his sermons that Hell awaits everyone in the town who do not go to church and confess their sins.

Father Maxi is rude and disrespectful towards the beliefs of others, such as he when he tricks [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who is Jewish, into helping [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], into doing the Stations of the Cross. Also in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]", he informs Kyle that because of his beliefs, he and his family will go to Hell without question.

However, he still attempts to be a good priest and leader of the community. In "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]", it's revealed that he's the ''only'' priest not engaging in pedophilia. As a result, he points out that they are to spread the word of God, not harm the innocent. He even goes to [[Vatican City]] to stop this and nearly brings down the church as a result.

==Relationships==
Though as a Roman Catholic priest Maxi is supposed to be celibate, he does not seem to regularly practice this. Like most of the adults in South Park, he has had sex with [[Liane Cartman]] at some point in his life, as mentioned in "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]". In "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]", he was caught having sex with a woman named Mrs. Donovan, however, it is unlikely that she is [[Betsy Donovan]], as her appearance was significantly different.

In "[[Cripple Fight]]" he admitted to having once been homosexual but claims to be reformed; however he apparently once had a sexual relationship with a man with Peterson who he was supposed to be trying to reforming of homosexuality. In "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]" he pushes for a reformation of the celibacy rules as a way to stop priest pedophilia. He befriends Butters in "[[A Boy And A Priest]]" as Butters comforts him after he is the butt of pedophilia jokes; during this episode, he decides to fight even harder to protect the children from the church's habits of molestation.

==Trivia==
Much like [[Principal Victoria]], his inverted name is a reference to singer Maxi Priest.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Maxi Priest|Maxi Priest on Wikipedia]].</ref>
In "[[Cripple Fight]]", it is revealed that he used to be gay.
Like many men in South Park, he is a great fan of the Denver Broncos, going as far as including a Broncos chant in his sermons.
In "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]" it is shown or at least implied that he has had sex with [[Liane Cartman]].
Despite being minister for many of [[Kenny McCormick]]'s funerals he wasn't minister for the funeral for Kenny's [[Kenny Dies|semi-permanent death]]. Instead, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] was the minister (and was even wearing a priest collar). In addition, he is not the priest for his death in "[[Sexual Healing]]".
Father Maxi's devoutness to religion has ranged greatly over the course of the series - in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]" and "[[Cripple Fight]]" he is shown to sin, but in episodes such as "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]" and "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]" he is shown being extremely devout.
The top is his hair is darker in color than the sides, suggesting that he wears a toup√©e.
