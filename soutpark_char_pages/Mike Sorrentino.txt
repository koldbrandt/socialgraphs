}}{{LinkDisambig|Mike (Disambiguation)}}
'''Mike Sorrentino''' was a minor character who appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]". He was seen tied to a chair right before the Jerseyites started advancing upon [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. [[Randy Marsh]] interrogated him. When he replied, "It's a Jersey thing", Randy starts beating him up, asking what he means. 

==Appearance==
He wears a white shirt, a tan vest emblazoned with a decorative "S" near the right shoulder, a belt with a buckle bearing the letters "TS", and blue jeans. 

==Personality==
He seems to be unintelligent, to the point of not being able to explain what ''"It's a Jersey thing"'' means, although several other Jerseyites were the same way, so it is likely that he is of average intelligence among the other Jerseyites.
