The '''United States Border Patrol''', also known as the '''U.S.B.P'''., is a [[United States]] federal law enforcement agency. Their mission is to prevent and detect illegal aliens, terrorists and prevent illegal trafficking of contraband and people. Their only main role was in the episode "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]".

==Background==
[[File:Usbp_logo_2.png|thumb|left|163px|Logo of the United States Border Patrol]]
In "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]" the Mexicans realize that they would be better in [[Mexico]] rather in the [[United States]] after they misinterpret Butters' desire to "cross the border" and rejoin his friends as a genuine desire to return to Mexico, and a mass exodus of Mexican immigrants soon begins. As more and more Mexicans leave, the Border Patrol is tasked with keeping Mexicans in the U.S. instead of keeping them out. USBP even starts recruiting volunteers but with minimal effect.

Volunteer 5 is seen in the episode "[[Where My Country Gone?]]" as one of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] supporters near Niagara Falls.
