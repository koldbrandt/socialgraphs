'''Lolly the Candy Man''' is the owner of [[Lolly's Candy Factory]]. He appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", and [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode, "[[The Scoots]]".

Lolly had a contest to see who would get to have a candy shopping spree in his store, which Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny won. He gave them a ticket stub, which Kenny held on to. In "[[A Ladder to Heaven]]", he would not allow Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to go on their candy shopping spree, unless they acquire their winning ticket stub within one week.

In "[[The Scoots]]", Mr. Mackey goes to Lolly's when he is desperate for candy for Halloween. Lolly is cleaned out, and so Mr. Mackey is refused at gunpoint.

==Appearance==
Lolly is very overweight, he had red hair on the sides of his head and wide black eyebrows. He wore a clown costume consisting of a white t-shirt with pink stripes and lighter pink sleeves, cyan pants and black shoes.

Later in "[[The Scoots]]" he appears to have lost weight and was wearing more normal clothes, which consisted of a long-sleeved brown shirt, dark blue pants and black shoes. He also seems to have aged since he had several warts on his face. His black eyebrows became gray and shorter and his red hair became brown and gray.
