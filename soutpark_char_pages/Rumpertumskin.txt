'''Rumpertumskin''' was one of [[Eric Cartman]]'s stuffed animals along with [[Clyde Frog]], [[Polly Prissypants]], [[Peter Panda]], and [[Muscleman Marc]]. It made its first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]".

==Background==
During the events of "[[1%]]", Rumpertumskin was inadvertently destroyed by Eric Cartman after he tripped a trip-wire trap which detonated a bomb collar around Rumpertumskin's neck. Although the perpetrator of the "killing" was thought to have been Polly Prissypants, it was actually Eric Cartman who was pressured by his peers and by his mother indirectly to grow up and give up his stuffed animals.

Rumpertumskin appeared in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos in "[[Dances with Smurfs]]".

==Appearance==
Rumpertumskin is an overweight purple dragon with a pink stomach, pink wings, and burgundy spikes on its head and tail.
