'''Mrs. Rodriguez''' is [[David Rodriguez]]'s mother and co-owner of [[Nueva Familia]] with her husband, [[Mr. Rodriguez]]. She first appears in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[You're Not Yelping]]".

==Background==
In "[[You're Not Yelping]]", Mrs. Rodriguez is hard at work in her family's restaurant preparing meals for [[Eric Cartman]], who is posing as a yelp critic in order to receive free food. Her husband, in a panic, asks her to rush two taco orders for Cartman.

After [[Whistlin' Willy's]] stands up to [[Gerald Broflovski]]'s antics as a yelp critic, she and her husband become excited that they can finally stop giving these people excessive amounts of service. Unfortunately, this was short-lived as the yelp critics fought back against Whistlin' Willy's. She and her husband had decided to shut down the restaurant. The restaurant was later saved with David's [[The Yelper Special|plan]] to subtly retaliate against the yelpers.

==Appearance==
Mrs. Rodriguez wears black shoes, blue pants, and a red shirt. She wears two bracelets, gold and green respectively, and teal hoop earrings. She has long, black hair.
