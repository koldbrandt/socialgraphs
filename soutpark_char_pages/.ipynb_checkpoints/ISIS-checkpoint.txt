'''ISIS''', also known as the '''Islamic State of Iraq and Syria''', '''Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant''', '''ISIL''' and officially known as the '''Islamic State''', is a religious extremist terrorist group that appeared in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Go Fund Yourself]]". The organization appears again in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, "[[Naughty Ninjas]]".

==Background==
ISIS is a terrorist organization and an unrecognized state, known for being militant and religious extremists. They have taken over parts of [[Iraq]] and Syria in the Middle East.

The group show support for [[Eric Cartman]]'s start-up company, the [[Washington Redskins (Startup Company)|Washington Redskins]], much to the unease of [[Kyle Broflovski]]. ISIS later withdraws support for the Washington Redskins and boycotts the company, after witnessing [[Dan Snyder]] brutalized by the Dallas Cowboys.

In "[[You're Not Yelping]]", real footage of the group is shown during the Yelpers' war on [[Shi Tpa Town]].

In "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", they are seen supporting the boys' [[SoDoSoPa Ninjas]] club, believing they are a part of their religious extremism. The boys believed they were ninjas. Cartman was ecstatic when he learned that ISIS hated Jews.

==Appearance==
The members of ISIS appear wearing all black clothes, covering their bodies and faces, as well as battle gear. They also all carry black ISIS flags.
