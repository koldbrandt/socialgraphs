}}The''' 6th Grader with a Brown Hat''' is a male student at [[South Park Elementary]] who is generally seen as a background character.

==Background==
His first major appearance was in "[[Clubhouses]]" where he attends Cartman's party.

In "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]" he, along with the [[6th Grader Leader|6th grader leader]] and another unnamed [[6th Grader with Cyan Hat|6th grader]], frighten [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] with ghost legends, making [[The Boys|the boys]] want revenge.

In "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]" he along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] want to get a [[Back Door Sluts 9|porn film]] that was with the boys.

His last featured appearance was in "[[Pre-School]]" where he and the other 6th graders promise the boys to protect them from [[Trent Boyett]], but in the end all fail.

==Personality==
Despite being one of the three main 6th graders, not much is known about his personality. He was shown to behave the same way as most other 6th graders, like enjoying bullying younger children. Like the other 6th graders, he stopped being a bully in recent episodes, as seen in "[[Butterballs]]" where he participates in Stan's anti-bullying video.

==Appearance==
He wears a brown earflap beanie, a dark cyan coat, a brown collar, brown gloves, brown pants, and black shoes. He has freckles and thick black eyebrows, he is slightly overweight and looks shorter than most 6th graders.

In his prototypical appearance, his clothes were darker and he didn't have a visible nose.<gallery position="center" spacing="small" caption="Images of 6th Grader with Brown Hat" widths="140">
