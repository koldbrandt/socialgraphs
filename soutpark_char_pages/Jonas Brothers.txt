The '''Jonas Brothers''' is a pop-rock boy band, famous for their appeal to "tweens". They appear in "[[The Ring]]" and made a brief cameo in "[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]".

==Background==
==="[[The List]]"===
A poster of Joe Jonas is seen hung on the wall of the girls' Pleases & Sparkles club.

==="[[The Ring]]"===
In an attempt to lure her into a sexual relationship, [[Kenny McCormick]] takes his new girlfriend, [[Tammy Warner]] to a Jonas Brothers concert, after discovering that they apparently cause her to become sexually aroused. After the concert, the Jonas Brothers invite several girls into their dressing room, where the girls assume they're there to give the boys blow jobs. The boys have no idea what blowjobs are, and instead, preach to the girls about their religious faith, and then give the girls [[Purity Ring|purity rings]] in an attempt to encourage them to not engage in any sort of "naughty" behavior such as sex, drugs, watching "naughty TV shows", or swearing.

While the boys are successful at doing this, it is revealed that the Brothers dislike the idea of forcing the rings on the girls, wanting their careers to be about their music. [[Mickey Mouse]], their boss and the owner of the Disney Corporation, forces them to promote the rings, as he wants to sell sex to little girls, but without parents realizing it. When the Brothers try to back out of their deal with Disney, Mickey Mouse proceeds to beat the lead singer to keep them in line. After [[The Boys|the boys]] reveal the truth behind Mickey's plan, the Jonas Brothers were freed from his control.

==="[[Funnybot]]"===
In the film featuring [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]] having sex with two girls, two posters, one featuring headshots of the three brothers and another promoting ''Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience'', can be seen on the bedroom wall.

==="[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]"===
The Jonas Brothers made a brief cameo in a music video that [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] was watching until [[Stephen Stotch|his father]] changed the station to something "educational".

==="[[Member Berries]]"===
