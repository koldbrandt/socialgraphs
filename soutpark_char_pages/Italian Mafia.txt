The '''Italian Mafia''' are an organization featured in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''. They also form the management of [[Buca De Faggoncini]].

==Background==
During [[The Bowels of the Beast]] mission, as [[The New Kid]] and [[Captain Diabetes]] were chasing [[Classi]] in [[The Peppermint Hippo]], the latter escaped to the side door of Buca De Faggoncini, where a member of the mafia was on standby to deal with the superheroes. However, his warning shot accidentally took down a neon sign which crushed him. The New Kid later uses the Timefart Glitch to reverse time, with the man running back into the restaurant.

After defeating a few chefs, including the [[Buca De Faggoncini Chef|head chef]], New Kid and Captain Diabetes find the mafia in the back playing poker, with Classi beside them. The mafia attempted to gun the superheroes down, turning against Classi as well, but were interrupted and beaten up by the Red Wine Drunk [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], who was looking for his car keys.

The next day, [[Harrison Yates]] reprimanded the mafia for the failure in their part in lacing cat piss into drugs and alcohol, threatening to replace them with other factions.
