'''Malcolm McDowell''' is the narrator of the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Pip]]". 

==Background==
Introducing himself as "a British person", he opens with telling the audience that [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] have decided to tell the origins of [[Pip Pirrip]]. He narrates various parts of the story, but most of it is shown as an actual episode with the viewer following the characters. He closes the episode as well.

==Appearance==
Dressed in a suit, the British Person is sat in a chair in a study with the book ''[[wikipedia:Great Expectations|Great Expectations]]'' in his hand, though towards the end of the episode the plot takes a much more unusual path in reference to a regular ''[[South Park]]'' twist of a story. He has white hair and has a British accent and heritage, which is where he derives his name from.

Naturally, he has the appearance of his actor, though it is not known if he is intended to be Malcolm McDowell or someone else.
