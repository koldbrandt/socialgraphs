'''Jennifer Lopez''' first appear in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]".

==Background==
[[File:FatButtandPancakeHead011.png|thumb|left|Handpuppet as Jennifer Lopez on Cartman's hand]]
After years of success as a recording star, actress, and other artistic fields, Jennifer Lopez develops a raging ego and unstable temper, which begins to bother the record executives of her record label. And so when a "younger" and "spicier" performer by the name of [[Mitch Conner|Jennifer Lopez]] appears on the music scene, the executives become anxious to hire her. However, not wanting to have two Jennifer Lopez's signed to their label, they chose to fire the original one. Lopez does not take the dismissal well, blowing up into a furious rage at being told that she was fired and that she was a "mean-spirited bitch, who spits on people for being poor".

She immediately rushes to [[South Park]], with her boyfriend [[Ben Affleck]], so as to confront the new Jennifer Lopez. She's however shocked and confused to find that the new Jennifer Lopez is in fact a ventriloquist puppet of [[Eric Cartman]]. Initially thinking it's a joke, she becomes completely enraged when the hand insults her, to which Lopez threatens to kill her and Cartman if they don't back off. Unknown to Lopez however, Affleck immediately becomes attracted to the new Jennifer.

Soon after, the new Jennifer Lopez begins working on her album and starts dating Affleck behind the old Lopez' back. Again falling into a psychotic fury, Lopez proceeds to attack Cartman's hand with a baseball bat, breaking several fingers in the process. However, the new Jennifer continues to date Affleck and become engaged. This finally sends Lopez over the edge, and she chases down the new Jennifer with a chainsaw, intending to kill her. The police, record executives, Ben Affleck and [[The Boys|the boys]] all chase after the two Lopezes, and Cartman, and are shocked to discover that the new Jennifer Lopez is, in fact, a con-artist named "Mitch Conner". Mitch kills himself with a suicide pill, however, Lopez does not return to her music career. Instead, she is arrested for assault and attempted murder, and after being released ends up working at a fast-food taco place.
