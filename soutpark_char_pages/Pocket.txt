'''Herbert Pocket''' was [[Pip Pirrip]]'s roommate in the [[Season Four]] episode "[[Pip]]".

==Background==
Pocket teaches Pip the basics of being a gentleman, such as not putting one's knife in one's mouth, not passing gas at the table, not placing a napkin in the glasses, and not checking one's penis for scabs at the diner table. Pocket had a large collection of baby bunnies, of which [[Estella Havisham|Estella]] killed twenty-five. It is logical to assume he never forgave her for her sins.

He helps Pip defeat [[Miss Havisham]] and is joyful at the prospect of a happy ending. It is announced at the end of the episode that Pocket died of Hepatitis B, which could lead to the fact that he was too good a boy and accidentally pricked himself on a drug needle through which it was contracted.

==Appearance==
Pocket is a cheerful bloke with combed strawberry blonde hair, large front teeth, and a crooked smile. He wears brown pants, a red vest over a white formal shirt, and a large teal bow tie.
