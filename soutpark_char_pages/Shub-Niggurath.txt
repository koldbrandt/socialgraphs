'''Shub-Niggurath''' is an Elder God. She made her first appearance in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]],'' and a cameo in the "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]".

==Background==
Shub-Niggurath is an Outer God in the Mythos and an incredible fertility deity, with the ability to give life, and take it with little effort.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' she is an Elder God who resides in the basement of [[Park County Police Station]], being worshiped by the cops. Due to the fact she apparently craves "dark meat," the police falsely arrest black citizens across town and feed them to her.

===[[The Thin White Line]]===
Shub-Niggurath appears as the final boss in the police station, and is destroyed by the temporary alliance formed by Coon and Friends and Freedom Pals.

==Appearance==
Like many Elder Gods, Shub-Niggurath is a morbid combination of tentacles and giant mouths.

Despite the complete greatness of her tentacles, she is in possession of a gigantic one, used to deliver powerful hits to the enemies, the ones who are hit will have no chance of survival. Similarly, among her mouths, there is a giant one located in the upper body, with knife-like teeth to chomp. She also has a smaller exit below for ovulating and regurgitating devoured allies. Blinking yellow dots can be seen scattered across her body, likely serving as light receptors, therefore her eyes.

==Incantation==
<poem><i>iä, iä, Shub-Niggurath!

Black Goat of the woods!

Blessed be us, your faithful servants, the destroyer of light.

iä, iä, Shub-Niggurath! Black Goat with one-thousand morbid young, Draw down the moon and extinguish the sun.
</i></poem>

==Powers and Abilities==
Shub-Niggurath is an evil goddess with powers beyond imagination, any possible way of attack will result in complete devastation and any attack against will be proven futile, the only way to defeat her is through feeding "White meat" to her.

Due to being a fertility goddess, she is able to continuously ovulate and plant eggs onto the battlefield, which will explode on those surrounding it upon taking damage.

As revealed in the process of combat, Shub-Niggurath has two phases: Enraged and Dormant.

==Battle==
Shub-Niggurath is fought at the end of the Police Station during [[The Thin White Line]]. As an Elder God (or goddess), she is tremendously powerful, being completely immune to any of New Kid's attacks and armed with ''two'' instant-kill moves. However, her dietary habits can be used against her; when she uses her Devour move to catch a victim, she can be healed or harmed depending on the quality of the flesh.
*White kid: 1000 damage
*White grown-up (cops): 2500 damage
*Black kid (Tupperware and The Amazing Butthole, if they're black): 2500 heal
Any devoured heroes will be spat out of Shub-Niggurath, but they'll be unconscious and in need of an immediate revival. Also, black kids won't be regurgitated unless at least one white victim was also devoured in the previous Dormant phase.

Shub-Niggurath has two distinct phases that she will cycle through for the entire battle; an enraged state and a dormant state. Both forms rely heavily on summoned minions to force the heroes into range of her powerful telegraphed attacks.

===Phase 1: Enraged===
After consuming white meat (including at the start of the battle, thanks to CLASSi), Shub-Niggurath will burst out of her pit in a blind fury. At this point, she will begin readying a real-time attack; a lethal tentacle slam that hits the four columns nearest to her.

The objective of this phase is to get as many heroes as you can to the two leftmost columns of the battlefield before Shub-Niggurath's attack meter fills up; when it does, the All-Mother will interrupt the current turn to inflict a knockout blow on anyone in range. The cultists will attempt to block New Kid's path, using the occasional knockback move to force them closer to their goddess.

The battle shifts to Phase 2 once Shub-Niggurath's meter is full.

===Phase 2: Dormant===
After smashing the battlefield with her mighty tentacle, Shub-Niggurath will spit out two pulsating eggs from one of her mouths (as well as any heroes that she devoured in her previous Dormant phase). The eggs will land on random squares near the middle of the battlefield; they have 1 HP and no attacks on their own, but they also explode when damaged, knocking back anyone directly adjacent to them. After "ovulating", the Black Goat of the Woods will retreat into her pit, with only several tentacles being visible.

In this phase, Shub-Niggurath's only move is Devour, a telegraphed attack that covers the two rightmost columns of the battlefield. Any humans in the danger zone will be consumed on the boss's turn, healing or harming her depending on their size and race.

After catching someone with Devour, Shub-Niggurath will re-emerge as more cultists arrive to force the team towards her (including Sergeant Yates, the first time this happens). From here, the battle returns to Phase 1, looping until either New Kid or the boss are defeated.

==Trivia==
*Shub-Niggurath is apparently not fully immortal, due to the very fact that she was defeated by a bunch of kids and cannot actually "kill" Mysterion (although she can devour him), though her defeat may have simply resulted in the destruction of her physical form rather than true death.
*Shub-Niggurath can take damage (albeit much less damage, only 1000) from eating either a white New Kid or your teammates (excluding Token). If she eats the New Kid (if the character is black) or Token, then she will regain 2500 health.
*Shub-Niggurath in the Mythos is described as an "enormous cloudy mass" entity, an external form that the game fails to match well with. However, the game's appearance matches "the Dark Young"'s quite perfectly, with four main tentacles and a tree-like form. This implies that the "Shub-Niggurath" under the station may be only an extension of the true Elder God.
**This may also explain why the Skeleton key made to enter the basement is "standard issue" for every police station.
*Shub-Niggurath is the second Lovecraftian deity to appear in South Park, the first her grandson [[Cthulhu]].
