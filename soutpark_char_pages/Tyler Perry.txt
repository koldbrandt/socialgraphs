'''Tyler Perry''' is an American entertainer who appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[Funnybot]]".

==Background==
In "[[Funnybot]]", he was the only person who was present to collect his comedy award, other than [[Jimmy Valmer]]. He received the Kathy Griffin Award, which is awarded to the person who is most likely to show up to collect it.

Throughout the episode, Perry communicates almost exclusively through catchphrases from his movies, such as "Oh Lerrrrd!" and "Halleluyer!". The episode portrays his comedy as appealing solely to black people - [[Token Black]] is the only one who laughs at his jokes, giving him money every time he speaks. [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] also mentions watching one of Perry's movies with his family before the end of the world. Both of them are embarrassed to admit that they find Perry's comedy funny.

Tyler's antics become increasingly absurd, reaching the point that he dressed up as his most famous character, Mabel Simmons, and refused to leave [[South Park Elementary]]. At the end, the Americans and Germans secured him within an enormous metal sphere deep underground, in place of [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]], stating that he was "one of the worst threats to the world."

==Appearance==
Perry initially appears as a relatively faithful portrayal of his real-life self, dressed in a suit and tie.

However, later in the episode, he appears as his character Madea, wearing a purple dress, a gaudy pearl necklace, a pair of thick-rimmed pink glasses, and a long grey wig, with inexpertly applied lipstick.
