'''Emperor Hirohito''' appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Chinpokomon]]". He was voiced by Junichi Nishimura, a creative consultant at [[South Park Studios]].

==Background==
Hirohito was the Emperor of [[Japan]] during World War II. He sought revenge for his defeat by brainwashing the children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] using the [[Chinpokomon]] toys and games and having them bomb Pearl Harbor. His plans were eventually foiled by the parents of South Park. He was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Akihito|Akihito]].

Hirohito is also known for his distinctive technique of distraction, whenever someone troubles him he makes a quick comment on the person's penis size, describing it as being large and gigantic, and his own penis being small and tiny. This method turns out to be very effective, [[Bill Clinton]] as an example has been fooled by him.

== Appearance ==
Hirohito wears a dark/olive-green formal coat with a badge pinned on it as a sign of royalty and honor. He has a small mustache and has unusually large ears. He also has combed black hair and rectangle-rimmed spectacles. He has stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes.
