'''Anthony Stephen Fauci''' is an American physician who is well known for being one of the lead members of [[Herbert Garrison]]'s [[White House]] Coronavirus Task Force in addressing the [[COVID-19]] pandemic in the [[United States]]. He appears in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode "[[The Pandemic Special]]".

==Background==
When the town becomes infected with mustaches growing on their faces after [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] puts his infected semen in the "Pandemic Special" weed, Anthony Fauci appears on a podium at the South Park Hospital to give his advice on avoiding the spread of the mustaches. He tells the townspeople that they should wear their masks over their noses and mouths where the mustaches would be, instead of wearing them like "chin diapers", but he is written off by [[Stephen Stotch]], who believes that wearing a diaper over his nose and mouth is disgusting.

==Appearance==
Fauci has short gray hair and gray eyebrows. He also seems to have a slight blush on his cheeks. He wears a black suit over a light blue shirt and a dark blue tie as well as gray reading glasses. Like everyone else in town, he wears a surgical mask.
