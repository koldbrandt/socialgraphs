'''Franz''' was the ringleader of [[the Burger King Bandits]] in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[Super Fun Time]]".

==Background==
Whilst escaping from the police, Franz and his gang took refuge in [[Pioneer Village]], taking [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class and the employees hostage and killing the [[Sheriff McLawdog|sheriff]].

During the thieves' stay in Pioneer Village, Franz was continually annoyed by the employees' refusal to break character, to the point where he executed [[David Palmer|Ol' Smithy]] for refusing to tell him the door code to the mine shaft.

Franz was defeated when [[Stan Marsh]] told [[Murderin' Murphy]] that Franz was the one who had "killed his pa," causing Murphy to angrily tackle the criminals' leader. This gave the police, stationed outside of the village, the opportunity to storm in. All of Franz's gang except for [[Vosky|one man]] were killed and Franz himself was arrested.

==Appearance==
He had a goatee and wore a business suit with a striped tie. He also carried what appears to be an M16 and a silenced pistol.

==Trivia==
*In both name and overall appearance, Franz is a parody of Alan Rickman's character, Hans Gruber, from the movie ''[[wikipedia:Die Hard|Die Hard]]''.
