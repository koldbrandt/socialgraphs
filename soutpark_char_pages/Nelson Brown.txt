'''Nelson Brown''' was a member of the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] who had terminal [[cancer]]. He often felt ill and weak, and was ultimately confined to a hospital bed because of his affliction. [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] replaced him on the pee-wee hockey team.

He died at the end of "[[Stanley's Cup]]" as the hope of winning the pee-wee hockey game was the only thing that was keeping him alive.

==Appearance==
Nelson had a pale complexion and matted hair due to his cancer. He is extremely frail and pale, also due to his cancer, and he is mostly seen in the hospital. In the beginning of the episode, he is seen wearing the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] uniform but for the rest of the episode, he is seen in a hospital gown in a hospital.
