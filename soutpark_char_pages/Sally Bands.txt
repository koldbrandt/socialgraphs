==Personality==
She appeared to be very articulate and driven, appearing incredibly motivated on ensuring Ike's presidency. Among other measures, she called for a re-evaluation of the votes after [[Filmore Anderson]] was declared president, on the grounds that the ballots were misleading and many kids did not know whom they were voting for.

Eventually, however, she got bored of the game and decided she would rather fingerpaint.
