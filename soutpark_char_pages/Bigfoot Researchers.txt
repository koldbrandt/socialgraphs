The '''Bigfoot Researchers''' are cryptozoologists (researchers of mythological beings) who appear in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Jewpacabra]]", where they were seen at their [[Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization|research station]] and at the location of the [[Easter Egg Hunt]].

==Background==
[[File:BigFootResearchers3.png|thumb|Bobo using binoculars to spy on Eric Cartman.]]
In "[[Jewpacabra]]", they are seen when [[Mr. Billings]], his staff, and [[Eric Cartman]] go to the [[Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization]] for analysis of Cartman's video of the supposed Jewpacabra. The researchers review the video as a group and come to the conclusion that it was actually of a real Jewpacabra, after converting it to infrared and adding a picture of a rottweiler next to the arm.

Mr. Billings, wanting to maintain a fun and safe environment for the Easter egg hunt, decide to use Cartman as a sacrifice for it. Cartman is chained to a concrete block, forced to wear a bunny costume, and drenched with chicken blood.

Believing they sighted a three-foot-tall "bunny man", the researchers shoot Cartman with a tranquilizer gun. Having successfully sedated Cartman, they leave the park with the goal of having a show on Animal Planet using their dart gun as evidence.

==Appearance==

The researcher with red hair wears a black shirt under a large blue jacket, black pants, and black shoes. He has a thick red beard.

Bobo wears a white shirt under a gray sweater under a green jacket. He has brown hair and also wears a dark gray fur hat, blue pants, and large brown boots.

The researcher with gray hair wears a white shirt under a blue jacket, tan pants, and dark brown boots. He has gray facial hair.

The researcher with the pink jacket wears a red shirt, black pants, and a blue chullo hat. She has dark brown hair and also wears large brown boots.

==Personality==
The Bigfoot researchers all appear to be intellectually disabled. They display many speech impediments and their handicap is shown in their mouths. They are evidently very unintelligent, naïve, and gullible, given how they passionately believe in the existence of mythical and fictitious creatures despite the complete lack of scientific evidence to prove such absurdities.

==Trivia==
*The Bigfoot researchers are a parody of the team from the Animal Planet program ''Finding Bigfoot''.
