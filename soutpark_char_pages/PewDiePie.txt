'''Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg''', popularly known as '''PewDiePie''', is a Swedish video game commentator and internet celebrity who appears in the [[Season Eighteen]] episodes, "[[REHASH|#REHASH]]" and "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]". PewDiePie was the most subscribed channel on YouTube until T-Series overtook him on March 30, 2019. He specializes in the "Let's Play" video game genre. He currently has over 100 million subscribers on YouTube to this day.

==Background==
PewDiePie is featured in "[[REHASH|#REHASH]]", where his videos have mesmerized [[Ike Broflovski]], as well as his friends, much to the anger and confusion of his brother [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who Ike and his friends call "grandpa" for not understanding the appeal of PewDiePie. Seeing the appeal of making money and becoming famous for and commenting on things, [[Eric Cartman]] becomes a YouTube commentator, taking the name "[[CartmanBrah]]", and specializes in commenting on other peoples' commenting.

He returns in "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]" to stop CartmanBrah. After doing so, he plays ''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare'' and thanks ''[[South Park]]'' for featuring him in the show.
