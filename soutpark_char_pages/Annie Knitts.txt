[[File:Annie funnybot png.png|thumb]]
'''Annie Knitts''', formerly '''Annie Nelson''' and '''Annie Faulk''', is a student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She was originally voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", then [[Mona Marshall]] later took over that role. However, Annie is now voiced by [[April Stewart]].

Annie is one of the popular girls in the fourth grade at [[South Park Elementary]]. She is friends with girls such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], and [[Lola]], along with most of the other [[List of Female 4th Graders|4th grade girls]].

==Background==
===Name===
Her name was first heard in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", when she was at the [[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore store]] with [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Red McArthur]], and [[Bebe Stevens]]. Prior to that, she was referred to as "Jordan" in "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]", though many background characters at the time were frequently called by different names. Despite the finalization of her first name, she was called "Ashley" in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", but her first name seemed to have gone back to its current one in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[The Hobbit]]".

Her surname has changed a lot throughout the series; it was revealed as "Faulk" in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", but in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[The Hobbit]]", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] refers to her as "Annie Nelson". However, her other surname, "Knitts", was finalized in the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]],'' though she was once again referred to as " Annie Nelson" in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Annie has a somewhat major role in this game. In her first appearance, she is seen being bullied by [[Bully Girls|three older girls]] by taking her [[Justin Bieber]] toy. After [[The New Kid]] fights the bullies, Annie befriends him. When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] asks Douchebag to recruit the girls, he finds Annie and she takes him to the girls' hideout by blindfolding him. During the siege on [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s fortress, she is dressed as a fairy. She also uses her fairy costume as her picture on Facebook, even before the New Kid recruits the girls.

==Appearance==
She wears a brown collarless jacket and black pants. Her hair is short, light blonde and tight-curly. In "[[The Hobbit]]", [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] states that Annie's hair is also thin. In "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]] ", she wore an aquamarine tube top, a teal-and-aquamarine wrap skirt, and white shoes.

She wears a pink pajama shirt with a light purple collar when she goes to bed, as shown in "[[Skank Hunt]]".
{{GallerySubPage|name=Annie Knitts}}

==Personality==
Annie is portrayed as a kind and friendly person; however, this leads to her being a target for bullying. In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', she is seen crying because three older girls took her Justin Bieber doll.

Annie is also rather na√Øve and innocent minded, admitting that she did not know what a queef was in "[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]". Despite her shortcomings, she showed a trait of leadership and convinced Wendy and the rest of the girls to break up with their boyfriends in "[[Skank Hunt]]" in an attempt to prove a point about [[Skankhunt42]]'s misdeeds.

==Family==
===[[Mrs. Knitts]]===
[[File:Mrs. Polk.JPG|thumb|right|Annie's mother, Mrs. Knitts.]]
[[Mrs. Knitts|Annie's mother]] was seen with her in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore]]", buying her things and waiting in line to check out. She had a speaking role, criticizing [[Mr. Testaburger]] for not letting his daughter buy anything in that store.

Her mother is also seen at the parents' meeting in "[[T.M.I.]]" sitting with her father; while he is not actually visible, her mother is seen looking off-screen towards someone, in the same manner the other parents look towards each other.

===Other Relatives===
In the toy shop in "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]", she is seen trying to get the attention of an unnamed female relative as she holds up a candy cane convincing her to buy it for her. This is most likely not a new mother, as her official [[Mrs. Faulk|mother]] first appeared with her in the [[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset|previous episode]].

==Interactions==
===4th grade girls===
Annie is usually seen with the other girls, such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], and [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]]. She is seen mostly with [[Red McArthur|Red]], though.

While she is depicted as being part of Wendy's group along with Red, Bebe, Heidi, and Nichole, Annie tends to take a backseat to other characters at some points, such as [[Esther]] and [[Millie Larsen]] in "[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]", [[Red]] and [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]] in "[[Marjorine]]", and [[Lola]] and Red in "[[The List]]".

===[[Token Black]]===
Annie and Token were often seen together in a friendly way in the earlier seasons. They were seen sitting next to each other on the bus in "[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]" and "[[Trapper Keeper]]" and chatting in class in "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]". They were also seen playing together on the swing set in "[[Clubhouses]]" and holding hands while singing "[[It's Easy, Mmm'kay]]" in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

In the recent seasons, they are not seen together as often, but they can be seen molding clay together in art class in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Toilet Paper]]".

===[[Butters Stotch]]===
Annie joined Butters' kissing company in "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]", and they seemed to be on good terms throughout the episode.

However, she can be heard in the crowd of girls encouraging [[Nelly]] to fight Butters in "[[Douche and a Danish]]", indicating that Annie disapproves of Butters' decision to start the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement along with the rest of the girls.

===[[Daniel Tanner]]===
[[File:SkankHunt00036.png|thumb|Annie breaking up with Daniel toward the end of "[[Skank Hunt]]".]]
In "[[Skank Hunt]]", Annie is revealed to have had a boyfriend, [[Daniel Tanner]], with whom she breaks up towards the end of the episode.
