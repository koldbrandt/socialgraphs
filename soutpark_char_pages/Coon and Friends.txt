'''Coon and Friends''' was a superhero team formed by [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] to fight crime in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in the hopes of building a franchise.

The original team first appeared in the episodes, "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]", and "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]". They later returned and expanded in "[[Franchise Prequel]]", only for the team to be torn apart by different franchise plans, a battle that was the primary focus of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

The final team lineup consisted of The Coon, [[Human Kite]], [[Mosquito]], [[Fastpass]], [[Super Craig]], and [[Captain Diabetes]] before they were absorbed by the [[Freedom Pals]].

==Background==
Amid an alleged crime wave, in town, the the Coon brought together eight heroes including himself at an elaborate headquarters constructed in [[Cartman Residence|his basement]] to form a team that could combat the rise in crime, offering them access to his resources, which are largely common household items, including basic equipment and electronics such as televisions and computers, with added Coon-branding. They had access to a "Coon Mobile", driven by [[Liane Cartman]] and more; however, members were asked to pay unspecified dues and fees for membership to enjoy these services. Only two members of the team were known to possess real superpowers, [[Mysterion]] and [[Mintberry Crunch]].

Their first mission was to help rescue people from a burning building, but the firemen, who were already there, keep them away from the scene for their safety. [[Captain Hindsight]] then arrives, tells the firemen what they did wrong, and leaves. The firemen consider the problem solved, and drive home, leaving 14 people to burn. The people's admiration for Hindsight enrages the Coon, who becomes obsessed with forcibly recruiting Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends, planning to dress [[Butters Stotch]] as Courtney Love and faking provocative photos of the two.

The group then attempts to help the victims of the DP oil spill, planning to sell lemon bars at a bake sale to raise money, however this gets set back when the Coon beats up Mosquito and Mintberry Crunch. The Coon is kicked out of the group by a unanimous vote for this and then grounded by his mom for beating up his friends and swearing soon thereafter.

In "[[Mysterion Rises]]", they proceed with the bake sale, gaining plenty of press attention and making some money for charity. Mysterion becomes the de facto leader, although it is presumed they take on a democratic vote, as suggested by Mosquito in "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]". They decide to keep the name 'Coon and Friends' specifically to spite the Coon, which Mysterion finds greatly amusing. The Coon, meanwhile, forms a new organization under the same name by teaming up with [[Cthulhu]], printing matching 'Coon and Friends' T-shirts for only the two of them.

In "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]", the Coon returns to town and implores Cthulhu to banish the members of Coon and Friends at Coon's command, to the [[City of R'Lyeh]], though Mintberry Crunch manages to run home before the banishment proceeds. Mysterion manages to escape by committing suicide and being reborn in the real world, while the others remain there waiting for help. They are ultimately rescued by Mintberry Crunch and brought back to the real world thanks to Mysterion.

The Coon and Friends reassemble in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[Franchise Prequel]]", hoping to kick off a superhero franchise. Fastpass wins an audition to join the team after telling them his superhero origin story, while [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], with [[Mark Zuckerberg]]'s support, creates fake 'news' about the Coon and Friends group on Facebook ruining their reputation and keeping Netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise. Super Craig is seen as a member of the group for the first time here, with [[Wonder Tweek]] appearing briefly at the end and [[Scott Malkinson]] is also mentioned to be a member.

While Zuckerberg is trespassing into the town, Fastpass runs around him, providing a distraction for Tupperware, and fires bursts of energy at him, to which Zuckerberg fires back in his mind but misses every shot. The Human Kite then punches him in the crotch, sending him to the ground. He is subsequently attacked by all the remaining members of the Coon and Friends.

Zuckerberg stands up, and the Coon and Friends dramatically fall to the ground. The Coon announces to the citizens on site that Zuckerberg had attacked innocent children who were simply trying to save black lives, and simultaneously support Jews, and crippled people. Zuckerberg is thwarted by the Coon and Friends and is forced to take down [[Facebook]], ruining Professor Chaos's plan.

Despite this, the group separates at the end of the episode due to petty franchise differences, introducing a major conflict that would be revisited in the [[South Park]] video game, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Members==
As of the end of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the team is defunct and has merged into [[Freedom Pals]]. Below was the lineup of the team at the time of the merger.

When night falls in South Park, Eric Cartman takes up the call and dons the Coon costume. This fearless crime fighter is the only one who can sort through the trash can of society.

[[File:Mosquito.png|220px|thumb|Mosquito]]
{{main|Mosquito}}

[[File:Fastpass.png|195px|thumb|Fastpass]]

===[[Captain Diabetes]] ([[Scott Malkinson]])===
[[File:Captain Diabetes.png|201px|thumb|Captain Diabetes]]
{{main|Captain Diabetes}}
Scott Malkinson could've been an ordinary child, but in a freak accident his mom farted on him during childbirth which gave him diabetes. Rather than dwelling on his misfortune, Captain Diabetes wields his sugary illness as a source of power that his enemies cannot overcome.

==Enemies==
*[[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] ([[Butters Stotch]]) - Defeated and held in "The Coon Holding Cell". He comments that its been six days and The Coon refuses still to give him anything to eat or drink, besides his own feces. Later ruins their reputation on Facebook to prevent them from receiving a franchise.
*[[General Disarray]] ([[Dougie O'Connell]]) - Seen on their 'biggest bad guys' board in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]".
*[[Cthulhu]] - A dark god who allied with the Coon and went on a killing spree throughout America, destroying everything Cartman hates. He banishes all of the heroes to another dimension, but he is defeated when Mint Berry Crunch uses his newly discovered godlike powers to overpower Cthulhu and seal him back into his own dimension.
*[[Cult of Cthulhu]] - Cthulhu's followers, which include [[Peter Nelson]], The [[Goth Kids]], and [[Richard Adler]]. In "[[Mysterion Rises]]", they killed Mysterion with a switchblade, but he came back shortly after.
*[[Captain Hindsight]] - After [[Eric Cartman]] uses fake pictures as blackmail. Due to a combination of blackmail and the pressure of being a hero, he is not Captain Hindsight anymore (he went back to being a news reporter) and therefore not a real threat.
*[[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] - Formerly their leader, now is out for revenge on his former group for kicking him out. He even went as far as to label the group evil and traitorous, oblivious to the fact that he is the true villain. Eventually defeated when Mint Berry Crunch defeats Cthulhu. He was held in the same cell as Professor Chaos, for a time.
*[[Herbert Garrison]] - Seen on their 'biggest bad guys' board in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]".
*[[Mark Zuckerberg]] - Defeated by Coon and Friends during a confrontation with Police on the town's main street.

==Trivia==
*Trey and Matt first conceived of the idea of a superhero team involving the kids while working on "[[The Coon]]", as mentioned in the episode's commentary track. It is not known if this was the same as the team that appeared in subsequent episodes. 
*Cartman and Cthulhu become "Coon and Friend" in "[[Mysterion Rises]]". Cthulhu even has a shirt for it as seen in "[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]". Cartman apparently trademarked the name "Coon and Friends" during this teamp; this was just to give him an excuse to get back at the others.
*Bradley and Kenny are the only members to actually have superpowers, the rest are just pretending.
*The Coon and Friends' most common method of dealing with their enemies is apparently locking them in a small cage without anything to eat or drink for long periods of time. They do this to Professor Chaos and The Coon.
*Tupperware suggested calling the superhero organization the "Extreme Avenger League", but was ignored by The Coon.
*In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', themed music tracks will play depending on the team/area. Coon and Friends' music is inspired by Marvel's ''Avengers'' franchise.
