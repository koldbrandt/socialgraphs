'''Pope John Paul II''', born '''Karol Józef Wojtyła''' in Wadowice, Poland was the religious leader of the Catholic church, from 1978 until his death in 2005. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]".

==Background==
Pope John Paul II made his first appearance in South Park during the episode "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]". In the episode, he receives a phone call from [[Sister Ann]] of the [[South Park Church]] after growing concerned about the messages [[Priest Maxi|Father Maxi]] is delivering to their congregation. When Father Maxi states that handicapped people like [[Timmy Burch]], who are incapable of speaking normally, will go to hell due to being unable to confess his sins, the Sister decides to ask the Pope's opinion. Unfortunately, the Pope is far too old, decrepit, and mentally vacant to answer the question and instead muttered half-phrases and blowing raspberries.

His next and final appearance was in "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]". Father Maxi, growing concerned about the shocking number of pedophile priests molesting children in the states, rushes to [[Vatican City]] in the hopes of getting the international priests to help him put a stop to it. When he arrives, however, he is shocked to learn that the entire Catholic faith believes that molesting children is acceptable, as it is not expressly forbidden in Vatican Law. When the father tries to get this changed, Pope John Paul, who is still feeble and ancient, in his own weak way declares that Vatican Law cannot be changed before asking the supreme being, "[[Queen Spider|The Great Queen Spider]]". In "[[Bloody Mary]]", when the news teller mentions "newly elected" Pope Benedict XVI, it means that Pope John Paul had passed away a few weeks prior.
