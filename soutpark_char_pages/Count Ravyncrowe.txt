'''Count Ravyncrowe''' is a member of the [[South Park Vampire Society]] who first appear in the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[The Ungroundable]]". His name was revealed in the [https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:100893 removed vampire kids quest] in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

==Background==
His first appearance in "[[The Ungroundable]]" was going out to the [[Goth Kids|goth kids]]' hangout spot and suggesting it would be a great place for a vampire meeting. He and a younger vampire are scared off by [[Henrietta]].

He is later seen in "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", at the noon meeting for the South Park Vampire Society. He sat in the second row, beside [[Larry]] and behind [[Vladimir]]. He does not play a significant role.

He and some other vampires in the Vampire Society make a brief appearance during the "[[Black Friday]]" trilogy, where they are seen throughout the episodes as part of [[Stan Marsh]]'s army to fight for the PlayStation 4 systems.

==Appearance==
Ravyncrowe wears black shoes, black pants, a black jacket with a wide triangular collar and red trim, square yellow-tinted sunglasses, black fingerless gloves, and a red shirt with some kind of word on it. He has longish black hair with a silver streak on the front left side. He has eyeliner as well.

In the game he wore a red suit with a white undershirt underneath and his glasses had red lenses.
