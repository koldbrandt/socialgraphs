:''For the [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] sports teams, see [[List of South Park Cows Sports Teams|South Park Cows]].''
The '''Cows''' of South Park are a herd of cattle owned by [[Farmer Carl Denkins]]. They had four major appearances, first in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", then the [[Season Two]] episodes, "[[Cow Days]]" and "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]", the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Fun with Veal]]", the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Ginger Cow]]", and the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode "[[Let Them Eat Goo]]". They are seen most often as background characters. They are the mascot for the [[South Park Elementary]] sport teams.

==Background==
In "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", alien [[Visitors]] are turning cows inside out. 
The Cows repeatedly try to escape a seemingly imminent death, but they are thwarted every time. At the end of the episode the cows find out that Carl, a Visitor new to his job, had only mutilated the cows by accident. The aliens also explain that cows are the most intelligent animals on the planet before handing them a gift. The gift is capable of zapping anyone into singing "I love to singa!" by Owl Jolson from a Merry Melodies short.

In "[[Cow Days]]", a county fair is held in honor of the cows. A giant cow shaped memorial clock is presented to the townsfolk which begins the annual "Running of the Cows", where the cattle stampede through [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] chasing the townsfolk. The cows steal the cow memorial clock and push it to an open field, where they begin to worship it as an idol. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|The FBI]] shows up to disperse the "cow cult", but is unsuccessful when they all commit suicide by jumping off the cliff.

Cows are seen being forcefully milked by machines during a tour of the dairy farm in "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]".

The children at [[South Park Elementary]] go on a field trip to a cow farm in "[[Fun with Veal]]". Here, Stan and the other boys discover a group of baby cows who were planned to be murdered and turned into veal. They returned later that night to kidnap the baby cows. They kept them locked in Stan's room with them to prevent them from being killed, causing a dramatic media stir, and briefly turning the boys into vegetarians.

In "[[Ginger Cow]]", Cartman turns one unsuspecting cow into a ginger to fool the other children at school into believing that other animals besides humans can have light skin, red hair, and freckles.

==Appearance==
The cows of South Park all resemble typical dairy cattle. They usually have a combination of black, brown, or white fur, and pink udders. The cows have traditional South Park-styled eyes and short horns. In later seasons, the cows are slightly redesigned to resemble more realistic cows. However, the South Park Cows cow, Mooy, still retains the original design of the cows from earlier seasons.
