As the main antagonist of the Alien film franchise, the Alien in [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]] is also antagonistic. It is killed by Jesus wielding an M60, previously his sword, after [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] uses his imagination.

==Appearance==
The Alien is mostly blueish-black in appearance, mostly. It is almost always a facultative biped, walking on hind legs and running on all fours.

Along the back are four dorsal tubes, an upper and lower pair, with a sharp spine separating them that runs the center of the torso.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Xenomorph_XX121_(Alien)#Appearance|title="Xenomorph XX121 (Alien): Appearance" on Xenopedia}}</ref>
