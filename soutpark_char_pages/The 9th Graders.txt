'''The''' '''9th Graders''' are teenagers who attend the ninth grade, they include [[Scott Tenorman]] and his friends.

Scott's friends were only seen twice in the episode "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]". They were seen reading magazines/books with him, and then they helped Scott make the chili with pubes for [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. They appeared in "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]" along with [[Scott Tenorman]].

==Appearance==
The ninth graders appear much taller than [[The 4th Grade|the fourth graders]], however, they are slightly shorter than the adults.

===[[9th Grader with Red Hood|Orange Haired Teenager]]===
This kid wears green shoes, yellow pants, and a long-sleeved, red hoodie jacket. He has orange hair and orange eyebrows.

==Personality==
They appear to be mischievous, and enjoy tormenting the younger kids, not by threats of physical violence like [[the 6th Graders]], but rather by outsmarting and deceiving them. One target in particular is [[Eric Cartman]], whom they trick into buying pubes by telling him that it would make him more mature in "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]". They later attempt to make him eat chilli laced with pubes, but this plan backfires massively.
