'''Nellie McElroy''' is [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]]'s mother who lives in Scotland. Her first appearance was in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[The Succubus]]", where she comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with [[Thomas McElroy|her husband]] for Chef's wedding.

==Background==
She made a second appearance in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]". Chef takes [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] to his parents' manor house in Scotland. She performs a shaman-esque ritual to exorcise [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] soul from Cartman's body. Although she is successful in exorcising Kenny's soul she is unable to re-seal it because Chef hadn't brought a victim child to sacrifice. Instead, Kenny finds his way into a pot roast Nelle was preparing, much to her dismay.

Her most recent appearance to date is in "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", where she is seen along with Chef in a crowd during the town's Christmas celebration. She is not seen at Chef's funeral in "[[The Return of Chef]]".

==Appearance==
She appears to be very old, with wrinkles and grey hair. She has a full head of curly grey hair and wears a yellow dress and a pearl necklace. Her eyes seem to be perpetually closed. She also appears to carry a small blue handbag around. In "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]", she appears in full voodoo regalia, with a long white robe, an intricate mask and headdress, fake wings and one scepter in each hand.

==Personality==
She appears to be friendly, being very accommodating to [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Eric Cartman]] when they visit her house in "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]". Nellie appears to be a little senile and over-concerned with household duties, worrying about Kenny's spirit getting all over the curtains and her pot roast, and occasionally muttering things to herself.

==Family==
===[[Jerome "Chef" McElroy]]===
She appears to have a good relationship with her son, Chef. He lives in the [[United States|USA]], and she appears to miss him a lot. When he appeared at their doorstep in Scotland she was overjoyed to see him again.

===[[Thomas McElroy]]===
Nellie and Thomas both love each other very much. They argue constantly over their frequent encounters with the Loch Ness monster.
