'''Prince Michael Jackson II''', also known as '''Blanket Jackson''', was seen in "[[The Jeffersons]]", when he and his father [[Michael Jackson]], under the alias "Mr. Jefferson", move to the neighborhood. He wore a mask constantly; however, at the end of "[[The Jeffersons]]", his father lets him take off. He reveals that he is a test-tube baby and never knew his mother.

==Appearance==
Blanket is wearing a small black tuxedo, a gray shirt, a yellow vest, black pants, and spats. He also dons a mask or veil up until the last few minutes of "[[The Jeffersons]]".

==Personality==
In contrast to [[the boys]], Blanket is an average boy. He appears to be more mature than his father, who wants to pretend to be a child, and Blanket wants a regular father/son relationship instead.

==Trivia==
*Blanket is clearly based on Michael Jackson's real son Prince Michael Jackson II, although he is more Caucasian than he is in real life.
*Blanket legally changed his name to Bigi to avoid being harassed at school.
*The real Blanket Jackson was 2 years old when "[[The Jeffersons]]" aired. Blanket (now known as Bigi), is currently {{age|2002|2|21}}.
