'''Josh Cashner''' is an actor hired by [[Motivation Corp.]] in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[My Future Self n' Me]]". He is intended to play as a future [[Kevin Stoley]], whose life went downhill after doing drugs and alcohol.

==Background==
[[Stan Marsh|Stan]] becomes suspicious of the the appearance of [[Future Stan]] and [[Future Butters]], and through searching his future self's wallet, he finds an address printed on a key card that leads him to the Motivation Corp building. There, both Stan and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] witness a couple hiring Josh Cashner to pose as their son's future self. Josh plans to tell their son that he "dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where he was sodomized in the ass."

==Appearance==
True to his role, he appears to be an older but a slovenly version of Kevin. He has a tuft of unkempt black hair, five o' clock shadow and has hair on his chest and arms. He wears a turquoise T-shirt with red rims, and dark blue pants.
