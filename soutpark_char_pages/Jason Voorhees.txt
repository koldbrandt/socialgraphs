{{LinkDisambig|Jason (Disambiguation)}}
'''Jason Voorhees''' is a fictional mass murderer from the ''Friday the 13th'' film series.

==Background==
In "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", a man dressed as Jason is seen arriving at Satan's Halloween Party. Later, in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", Jason is one of the members of the evil side of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]] who attacks the good side. He is shown with a feminine-like voice, declaring killing [[Strawberry Shortcake]] as "super hardcore". He is killed during the third episode but resurrected and put back behind the wall.

==Appearance==
Jason Voorhees wears black pants, black/grey torn up shirts, black gloves, a green coat, and a white hockey mask. His clothes are severely torn and are covered in blood. He also wears filthy brown shoes, which are in poor condition.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", Voorhees does not resemble ''South Park'''s traditional character style. Instead, his model features a more stylistic look about him, akin to rival [[Freddy Krueger]], who also appears.
*In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]", a Jason hockey mask is seen being displayed in Creepy City Costumes & Novelties.
*In "[[Bring the Crunch]]", [[Mimsy]] wears Jason's outfit.
*The mask is based on his Part 7 hockey mask.
*In the Halloween themed episode "[[Sons A Witches]]", [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] is seen in the intro wearing a hockey mask which strongly resembles Jason's mask.

==Prominence==
*"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" (mentioned only)
*"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]" - Member of the bad side of Imaginationland attacking the good side.
