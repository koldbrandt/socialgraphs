'''Ranger Pete''' was a forest ranger who appears in [[Season Fourteen]] episode "[[Insheeption]]", speaking to the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s class the day they went on a field trip to [[Frisco Woods]]. He introduced them to [[Woodsy Owl]], not suspecting that Woodsy was a child molester, and paired Mackey up with [[Billy Thompson]] and his friends, unknowingly setting in motion the events leading to the young Mackey's molestation by Woodsy Owl.

==Appearance==
He wears the standard forest ranger uniform: a light brown hat, a light brown shirt with several metals and patches, and brown pants. He also wears a belt with keys attached to it.

==Personality==
He seems to love the forest, which fits in perfectly with his job. He may also be slightly unintelligent, failing to see the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s fear when [[Billy Thompson]] wants to be in Mackey's group.
