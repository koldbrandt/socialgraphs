The '''Escaped Convict''' is a convict who appears in the episode, "[[Pip]]". After escaping from prison, he threatens [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]] in a graveyard, but Pip gives him a sandwich and cuts off his handcuffs. Touched by Pip's display of unconditional kindness, he moves to Wales and becomes a millionaire.

Afterwards, he repays [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]]'s favor by sending him to become a gentleman in London. He later tries to help Pip stop [[Miss Havisham]], but is killed when she spits acid on his face.

==Appearance==
He has an irregularly-shaped face, badly-kept stubble, thick and bushy eyebrows and a prominent forehead. He initially wears a loose brown shirt and blue trousers, but later dons a morning coat, grey waistcoat and white shirt with white gloves when he becomes a millionaire.
