'''Sarah Jessica Parker''' is an American actress known best for her role as the character Carrie in ''Sex and the City'' who appears in a non-speaking role in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]".

==Background==
In "[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]", Sarah Jessica Parker is a key component of a [[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|book]] written by [[The Boys|the boys]] (but later claimed to be the work of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) in which they describe or at least reference her ugly appearance, in order to make their story more disgusting and vulgar (always resulting with readers vomiting).

Her husband [[Matthew Broderick]], is interviewed while at the Oscars, about his wife being referenced in the book, while Sarah Jessica stands behind him. Although Matthew attempts to defend his wife's appearance, he is thrown off when the reporter then asks "How come a transvestite-donkey-witch is standing next to you and why is it wearing a dress?"

In order to get back at Butters for taking claim of their book, the boys attempt to get the book banned talking to the school board, along with Sarah Jessica Parker. The board however rejects their opinion that the book is vulgar for the sake of vulgarity, and instead claims that they do not understand the book's meaning (which in-truth, there is none according to the boys). Still wanting revenge, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] then suggests that they kill Sarah Jessica Parker and claim that Butter's book provoked her murder, just as ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' was supposedly responsible for the murder of John Lennon. Although [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], reject the idea, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] agrees to it and together he and Cartman set up Sarah Jessica Parker in the woods, dressing her up as a moose and making moose calls to get her shot by hunters. After she is found dead in the woods, the boys later place the blame on Butters. Butters however is unconcerned saying, "Oh, that's okay. At least she was ugly".

However, she eventually came back to life because she appears in "[[200]]". Though she can be seen arguing at the beginning, her voice is never heard.

==Appearance==
Sarah Jessica Parker is portrayed as extremely unattractive, in an unflattering and exaggerated version of her real life appearance. With an overly-large head, close-set eyes and heavy brows, her dull brown hair is pulled into a tight bun at the back of her head. She has a massive, prominent nose, and heavy mascara, giving her eyes a sunken appearance and making them look unusually small. She also has a large mole on the right side of her chin. She always wears the same vacant expression, even when being insulted.

Throughout the episode, she is seen wearing a canary yellow ball gown that she wore in the 2010 Academy Awards show.
