'''SuperSexyLisa18''', whose real name is unknown, is an internet troll who first appears in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Wieners Out]]". 

==Background==
In "[[Wieners Out]]", they are seen briefly at a once undisclosed location when [[Dildo Shwaggins]] brings [[Gerald Broflovski]] to the secret troll meeting.

In "[[Douche and a Danish]]", the meeting is revealed to be taking place at the [[Airport Hilton]]. After Shwaggins and Gerald coordinate, SuperSexyLisa18 joins the troll attack against [[Denmark]].

In "[[Fort Collins]]", they are only seen briefly at the impromptu troll party at the [[Broflovski Residence]]. They later leave after Gerald insists the trolls leave.

In "[[Oh, Jeez]]", they are captured by [[TrollTrace.com]] after believing they had been hired by [[Hillary Clinton]] to infiltrate and sabotage the service.

===Office===
SuperSexyLisa18 operates, and likely lives, in a basement. To their left is a monochrome television with a VCR attached and an old desk fan. Behind them are shelves filled with canned, and non-perishable foods. Also behind them is a cot and a pillow. In front of them are several empty bottles of John Adams beer, several smoked cigars, and their computer.

==Appearance==
SuperSexyLisa18 is overweight, and is most noted by their unprofessionally done tattoos and yellow buzz-cut. They wear a white shirt and blue jeans, and occasionally wears black sunglasses. They are often seen smoking a cigar and drinking beer.
