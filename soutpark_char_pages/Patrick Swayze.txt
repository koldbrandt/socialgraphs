'''Patrick Wayne Swayze''' was an American actor who appeared in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Dead Celebrities]]".

==Background==
Patrick Swayze was one of the few ghosts who made contact with [[Dr. Phillips]], informing that [[Michael Jackson]] had refused to accept his death.

He was later seen among the dead celebrities that were held back on board a purgatory plane. While waiting on board, he became tired of listening to [[Billy Mays]] advertising one of his products, and in response the latter threatened to kick him right in the balls. After Michael Jackson had accepted his death, the passengers were flown to [[Hell]], and expressed their dismay when they found that Hell was a tow-in gate.

==Appearance==
Patrick Swayze wears a black short-sleeved collared shirt, black pants, and black shoes.
