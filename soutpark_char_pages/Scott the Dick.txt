{{LinkDisambig|Scott (Disambiguation)}}
'''Scott the Dick''' first appears in [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]". He makes a cameo in the movie appearing on the [[Asses of Fire]] poster. He later appears in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]" and in "[[Royal Pudding]]", where he was seen as a "giant dick".

==Background==
Scott is a resident of Ontario, [[Canada]], and is the nemesis of Terrance and Phillip and notorious among his fellow Canadians. He is most well known for being "a dick" and driving a PT Cruiser. (Often, when he made his entrances to the scenes in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", the other Canadians in the same scene would shout out to the boys: "Oh no! It's Scott! He's a ''dick''!", or some variation thereof.) He is uptight and short-tempered, especially when it comes to Terrance and Phillip's toilet humor. Despite all of this, he claims he is the most patriotic Canadian.

===Occupation===
In the Season Two episode, "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", he was the duo's prosecutor in court and was made [[Saddam Hussein]]'s adviser later in episode. He was Saddam's adviser again in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]", while Saddam was in disguise as Canada's new Prime Minister. However, it was stated by Scott that his official job is a journalist, i.e. a television critic for magazines.

==Appearance==
He has brown, spiky hair. He wears dark blue jeans and a brown, long-sleeved shirt with a black capital "S" embroidered in the middle. In several of Scott's appearances, he wears a red tie with his shirt. Like most Canadian characters, he has a Pac-Man head.

In "[[Royal Pudding]]", as a result of radiation poisoning in Ottawa, he appears as a giant, which causes fellow Canadians to refer to him as a "giant dick" (despite the fact he is actually slightly taller than he used to be), he also wears a red tie during the episode.

==Personality==
He appears to be quite xenophobic and racist, stating that Americans are "power-hungry" and was going to send the boys away, in "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]". He also dislikes [[Inuit]] people, but seems desperate to deny that he is an "Eskimo racist". In general, Scott just seems to dislike everybody.
