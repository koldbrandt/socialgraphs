'''Horace Sanders''' is one of the [[Hopeful Hills]] campers in the [[Season Four]] episode "[[Fat Camp]] ".

==Background==
Horace is first seen when [[Eric Cartman]] enters the Hopeful Hills weight loss camp. He is said to be the only happy child in the camp. Later, when he appears as one of the children caught by an ice cream truck for trying to escape from the camp, he claims that he can no longer stand without eating any candy. His parents eventually decide to take him out of the camp die to him not losing weight. At the end of the episode, [[Chad]] tells his parents and [[Rick and Susan|counselors]] that Cartman was selling candy to the campers.

==Appearance==
Horace wears the standard Hopeful Hills uniform, which consists of a short-sleeved shirt with blue details and the camp's logo, blue shorts, and black shoes. Outside camp, he wears a dark blue shirt and brown shorts. He is overweight and appears to be larger than the 4th graders. His hair is curly and brown.

==Personality==
Horace acts more childlike than the other children, believing that the greasy monster was real, until later realizing that he was just one of the [[Rick and Susan|counselors]] wearing a costume. This led Cartman to call him "retarded". He also seems to be concerned about his weight.
