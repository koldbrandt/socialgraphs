'''Stephen Tamill's Friends''' are two 5th grade boys who are seen protesting the 99% with [[Stephen Tamill]] in "[[1%]]".

==Background==
The two boys, along with [[Stephen Tamill]] himself, decided to protest the 99% group (essentially [[Jimmy Valmer]] and [[Butters Stotch]]) under an "83%" group, blaming the [[The 4th Grade|fourth graders]] for the punishments as a result of the school's fitness test. Both groups got into an argument which later escalated to a physical altercation that media characterize as "class warfare".

==Appearance==
They are taller than 4th graders, but slightly lower than 6th graders. The first has combed light brown hair and wears a purple shirt with two orange stripes, blue jeans and black shoes. The other has orange hair combed with some spikes on top and wears a navy blue shirt with a V neck, pale green pants and black shoes.

==Prominence==
*"[[1%]]" - Seen protesting the 99% group.
*"[[Butterballs]]" - One of them can be seen together with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] and the others at the beginning of Stan's video.
*"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
One of them was among the children that [[The New Kid]] frees from detention in [[Detention Sentence]] quest.
