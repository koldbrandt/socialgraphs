The '''Nishimura Master''' is a sumo wrestling instructor at the [[Nishimura School of Martial Arts]]. He appears in [[Season Three]] episode "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]".

==Background==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] takes [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] to the Nishimura School of Martial Arts to help the latter learn sumo wrestling, preparing him for a fight against [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]]. The master gave Craig advice on treating "the body like stone, and mind like meatloaf" when it comes to sumo, while bringing out Cartman as a training opponent. Cartman ended up knocking out Craig instead, to which the master suggests to the former that he take up sumo as a profession.
