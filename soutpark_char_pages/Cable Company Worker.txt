The '''Cable Company Worker''' is a receptionist for [[Get Cable Company]] who appears in [[Season Seventeen]] episode "[[Informative Murder Porn]]".

==Background==
With TV shows depicting excessive sex and violent murder blocked by the boys and other children, the parents petitioned the company to get their shows back, only to find unhelpful staff rubbing their nipples while sarcastically complaining they can do nothing to help.

Later, as the boys went to the company to take down the murder porn channels altogether, they were treated no different from the parents, with the staff claiming that they cannot remove certain channels from packages.

==Appearance==
The worker appears with black hair and goatee. He wears a navy blue "Get Cable Company" uniform that includes two velcro flaps on the chest (exposing his nipples to rub on), along with grey pants, black belt and black shoes

==Prominence==
