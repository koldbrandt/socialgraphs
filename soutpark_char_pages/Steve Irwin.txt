'''Stephen Robert Irwin''', also known as the '''Crocodile Hunter''', was a TV personality from [[Australia]]. He was parodied in the [[Season Two]] episode "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]".

==Background==
Irwin appears in the episode "[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]" on the television program the boys are watching. He eventually comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to help capture [[Larry ("Prehistoric Ice Man")|Larry]] for [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] and the federal agents. He fails in his attempt, resulting in his death, and Larry escapes in a helicopter to Des Moines.

Irwin also appeared in "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" as a resident of [[Hell]]. [[Satan]] holds a costume party, mistakes him for a patron at the party wearing a crocodile hunter costume, and deems it offensive. Steve tells Satan that he is the real crocodile hunter, causing Satan to realize it is him and throw him out of his party because he didn't have a costume on. Irwin's appearance in this episode was a source of controversy, as it aired only weeks after his actual death by a stingray. This is despite the fact that the stingray got away and Steve got killed from a helicopter blade in an earlier episode.

In the episode "[[Stanley's Cup]]", [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] tries to convince the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] he is coaching that the Denver team won't kill them, and one of the players responds with, "That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays," referencing Irwin's cause of death.

In his last appearance in "[[200]]" he, alongside other celebrities, launched a class-action lawsuit against the town of South Park. He still appears with a stingray sticking out of his heart.

==Appearance==
He can usually be seen with a stingray in his chest, a direct reference to his accident. He wears tan shorts, a tan coat, and a dark brown hat lined with teeth. He has long blond hair and is rendered with an elongated head.

==Prominence==
*"[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]" - Plays a prominent role on television and later attempts to capture [[Larry ("Prehistoric Ice Man")|Larry]].
*"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" - Seen at Satan's party but kicked out.
