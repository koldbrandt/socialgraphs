She was assigned to teach [[Craig Tucker]], explaining to Craig the conspiracy theory about how the [[Hollywood Elites]] have been using [[Jeffrey Epstein]]'s child sex services to harvest [[adrenochrome]]. They rely on adrenochrome to stay in power and control the masses. As she was about to reveal information about the Hollywood Elites, she was interrupted by [[Mr. Garrison]], and was later placed on chokehold by [[Mr. Service|Garrison's secret service agent]]. Before dying, she revealed to Garrison that the White family was the party responsible for kickstarting the organization.
