They later appear at the end of the episode seeing Cartman revealing to Scott that his parents were killed by [[Farmer Carl Denkins|Farmer Denkins]].

*A boy almost identical to him can be seen as a 6th grader in "[[Pre-School]]"; the boy has orange hair and long eyebrows just like him, but was wearing a green hoodie, blue pants and black shoes.
*His model was used in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' as a 6th grader. He seems to be smaller in the game, however.
