{{LinkDisambig|Thomas (Disambiguation)}}
'''Thomas''' is a boy who suffers from [[Tourette's Syndrome|Tourette's syndrome]]. He appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode "[[Le Petit Tourette]]".

==Background==
While in [[Toy Safari]], [[Eric Cartman]] notices Thomas swearing constantly, giving him the idea of faking Tourette's syndrome. After [[Kyle Broflovski]] is deemed intolerant of people with the affliction, due to Kyle claiming Cartman to be faking it, he encounters Thomas when attending a meeting for people with Tourette's.

Thomas soon realizes Kyle was right, Cartman ''is'' faking it, so he later helps Kyle with a plan to stop Cartman from appearing on ''[[Dateline]]'' with [[Chris Hansen]] so he will receive more attention. Thomas and Kyle contact a number of pedophiles and invite them to the studio claiming it to be their home. Thomas welcomes them in, but upon seeing Hansen, they all shoot themselves, causing the audience to flee thus ruining the recording.

Hansen is angered with Thomas, but he replies with swearing which causes Hansen to leave. Cartman, however, is happy to have had the show canceled though, as he has lost control of his speech, revealing embarrassing secrets about himself. [[Craig Tucker]] then asks Thomas if he can be his friend, as he adores Thomas due to him being able to swear whenever he wishes.

==Appearance==
Thomas has a light yellow shirt with green stripes and dark green trousers. He has dark blonde hair and faint bags under his eyes.

==Personality==
Thomas suffers from regular outbursts of swear words, primarily "cock" and "shit," wherever he may be, which is not helped by his mother who tries to integrate him into society when he has a series of outbursts in a toy shop. He also has a very nervous personality, similar to that of [[Tweek Tweak]] or [[Rebecca Cotswolds]], and has black rings under his eyes implying he is very stressed and does not get much sleep.

He attends the [[Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation]] where there are regular meetings for him and other children with Tourette's syndrome.

==Interactions==
===[[Eric Cartman]]===
Cartman was faking having Tourette's in order to get away with saying swear words with impunity. After Cartman whispered to Thomas, "Isn't having Tourette's awesome?", Thomas immediately realized that Kyle was right about Cartman being a fraud. 

===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===

Thomas cooperates with Kyle in stopping Cartman's attempt to get on ''Dateline'' to spew anti-Semitic and vulgar messages on national television, agreeing that Cartman was faking the condition and giving people a negative impression of people affected by Tourette's. It is unknown how he felt about Kyle before realizing that Kyle was right about Cartman.

===[[Craig Tucker]]===

Craig seemed to think Thomas was very cool for being able to swear whenever he wanted. At the end of the episode, he asked him, "Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?" However, the pair has not been seen together since, nor has Thomas been seen at [[South Park Elementary]].
