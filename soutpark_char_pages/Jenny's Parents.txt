'''[[Jenny (Kindergartner)|Jenny]]'s Parents''' are [[City people|South Park residents]] who occasionally appear in the background with their daughter.

==Background==
They first appear in "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", where they are seen with their daughter at the end of the episode when the children's parents return to town. 

After this appearance they made some cameos in later episodes, such as "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" where they are seen with their daughter at Cartman's party, and "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]" where they are seen with their daughter among the crowd of desperate people. 

They made a most notable background appearance in "[[Britney's New Look]]", where they are seen in the crowd to take pictures of [[Britney Spears]], this time without their daughter.

==Appearance==
Jenny's mother has shoulder-length curly black hair, a purple shirt under a dark pink sweater, purple pants and black shoes. Jenny's father has black hair (gray in later episodes), large ears, and wears a long-sleeved cyan shirt, dark blue pants, and black shoes.
