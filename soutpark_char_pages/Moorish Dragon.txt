The '''Moorish Dragon''' is a made-up dragon controlled by the Moorish army. It is encountered during the combat tutorial in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
During the battle against the Moorish, [[The New Kid|King Douchebag]] brought down several warriors before approaching [[Cartman Residence|Cartman's house]], home to the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]]. In their final attempt to defeat the king, the Moorish released the dragon from [[Stotch Residence|Butters' house]], but was defeated by the King's ultimate power, which awarded them the "Dragon Slayer" title.

==Appearance==
The dragon is green in color and entirely crafted with cardboard. Similar to the Trojan Horse, the dragon can house about two Moorish men. The dragon is maneuvered with a red wagon which must be controlled by external units.
