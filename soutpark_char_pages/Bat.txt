The '''bat''' is an animal belonging to the order ''Chiroptera '' found globally and was suspected to be the origin of [[COVID-19]] until the [[pangolin]] was found out to be the actual origin of the coronavirus. The bat appears in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, "[[The Pandemic Special]]".  

==Background==
A new statement on the news reports that scientists have pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in Wuhan, [[China]]. They do not understand how the virus could have spread from a bat to a human.

[[Randy Marsh|Randy]] recalls a time where he went to China last season, where he was in a bar in Wuhan with [[Mickey Mouse]], during the events in "[[Band in China]]". They become intoxicated together and Mickey notices a bat on a table nearby, commenting that it is "so hot".

As Randy walks around drunk in the streets of Wuhan, he stumbles to Mickey Mouse hiding while doing sex activity with the bat. He recommends having a try at it and then proceeds to do the same.

Randy then flew home while ill, thinking he has the flu; which he thinks he has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. It is then revealed that Mickey had sex with many bats before as heard in a phone call with Randy.

But in a news report later in the episode, the virus was not caused by bats.

==Trivia==
*In the bar, Mickey Mouse points out that a bat is "a mouse with wings", which is a very common misconception. Bats are not related to mice or rats completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/are-bats-rodents|title=Are Bats Rodents?|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

==Prominence==
*"[[The Pandemic Special]]" - Randy and Mickey are seen having sex with one.
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.
