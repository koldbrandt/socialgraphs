'''Jonathan Sidney "John" McCain III''' was an American United States Senator from Arizona and was the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 2008 election. He first appeared in the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[About Last Night...]]".

On August 25, 2018, he died of cancer at his home in Phoenix, Arizona at the age of 81.

==Background==
McCain appeared in "[[About Last Night...]]", as part of a thief organization run by [[Barack Obama]], whom he has secretly been working with for years. They run for presidency so that Obama's victory will distract people long enough for him to sneak into the [[White House]]. This allowed their team to access a secret tunnel which goes under the [[Smithsonian Natural History Museum|Smithsonian museum]], which would further allow them to steal the Hope Diamond. They succeed and he, along with [[Sarah Palin]] and much of the organization's members, run off for paradise.

==Appearance==
McCain appeared in four different outfits.

While on television, announcing his opinion on his loss, he wears a dark grey suit, white dress shirt, and a gold tie. Whilst talking to [[Barack Obama]] shortly after Obama won the election, he wore a dark grey suit, light purple dress shirt with open collar, and a red tie.

While talking to the group of thieves, he wore an unbuttoned, light grey suit and a white dress shirt with open collar.

Shortly before leaving for paradise, he wore an unbuttoned, white suit, and a light blue, striped dress shirt with open collar.

==Personality==
McCain was extremely intelligent, teaming up with [[Barack Obama]] in order to steal the Hope Diamond.
