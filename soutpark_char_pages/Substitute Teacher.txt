The '''Substitute Teacher''' is an unnamed teacher at [[South Park Elementary]]. She is first seen acting as a substitute for the kindergarten class, but continues to appear as a minor faculty member throughout the show.

==Background==
The teacher is first seen at South Park Elementary in "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]" at a school assembly introducing [[Dr. David Nelson]] to the school. She has since made frequent background appearances in assemblies or meetings involving the school teachers.

She is seen teaching the [[Kindergartners|kindergarten class]] in "[[Fatbeard]]" during the morning announcements, but a new teacher takes over that class later that season and she continues to appear.

In "[[Gluten Free Ebola]]", she makes a frustrated remark that they are running behind because of [[Mr. Mackey]] once again, and the other teachers begin discussing his gluten-free diet.

She is also present at the larger staff meeting in "[[SUPER HARD PCness]]", where she is one of the teachers who overhears "[[Hold My Hand]]" by Hootie and the Blowfish playing in the background.

==Appearance==
The substitute teacher has bright brown parted hair with visible eyelashes and white earrings. She wears a pink buttoned shirt with a collar and a pearl necklace under a pale yellow jacket. She also wears a long purple skirt and has deep purple shoes.
