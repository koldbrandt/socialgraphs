'''The Quintuplets''' are a Romanian set of contorting sisters. They perform at the [[Cirque Du Cheville]] in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Quintuplets 2000]]". Only four of them have names: Glacas, Nadia, Natalia, and Baltania. The name of the fifth sister is never given.

They have an [[Romanian Father|absent father]], and are orphaned before the episode's events. Their [[Mrs. Vladchik|grandmother]] died of a heart attack during the episode as well. They lived briefly in the [[Marsh Residence|Marsh household]].

==Appearance==
Being identical quintuplets, they all look exactly the same. They wear the same clothes as well, a light blue shirt with a large, white trim, and a blue skirt. They have what appears to be a white bow in their, abnormally wide, black hair.

==Interactions==
===[[The Boys]]===
In "[[Quintuplets 2000]]", the boys attempted to befriend them so they could use them in their own "circus". They tried to show the Quintuplets about what is great about America, so they would stay. It is very likely that they broke off their friendship with the boys, stating that the boys were "the worst of them all".

===Family===
===[[Romanian Father|Father]]===
They despise their father, who neglected them when they were younger. Also, he walked out on them five years earlier.

===[[Mrs. Vladchik]]===
After their mother died, their grandmother became their caregiver, it is presumed they had a close relationship before she died.
