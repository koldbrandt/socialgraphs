'''John F. Kennedy''' was seen along with his son, [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]], as a resident of [[Hell]] during the song, "[[Christmas Time in Hell]]", in "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]". His brother, [[Ted Kennedy]], later appeared in "[[Dead Celebrities]]". Kennedy's assassination was parodied in the episode, "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", in which [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] attempts to shoot [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] from the book depository window in the same fashion as Oswald.

==Appearance==
He appeared with a photo-realistic head, much like [[Saddam Hussein]]. His skin was gray due to his head being taken from a black and white photo. He wore a gray, long-sleeve shirt and brown pants.
