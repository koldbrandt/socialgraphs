'''Babylonians''' are people from an ancient nation (modern-day Iraq and Syria), that is mentioned in the Bible; mostly in the context of colonizing the Ancient Kingdom of Judah and bringing it to its temporal end by exiling the Jews to Babylonia and Persia for 68 years in two waves (the first one of only the elites and upper-middle class in 597 BC and the second of the general population in 586 BC).

In "[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]", the Babylonians are humoristically mentioned as candidates for the ones who built the Pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]].
