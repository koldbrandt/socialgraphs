'''Madonna Louise Ciccone''' is an American singer-songwriter, who is commonly referred to as the "Queen of Pop". Some of her most famous songs include "Vogue", "Like a Virgin", "Like a Prayer", and "Material Girl". She appears in the episode "[[Kenny Dies]]".

==Background==
When [[Kenny McCormick]] is suffering from a debilitating illness and was hospitalized, the "Make A Wish Foundation" arrives to grant Kenny one wish before he dies. When asked what his wish would be, Kenny's responded (with Kyle translating his muffled voice), ''"not to die"''. After a moment of awkwardness, the Make A Wish people suggested that maybe he'd like to meet Madonna. Kenny, however, rejects this wish, and says Madonna is ''"...an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself."''

At that moment, Madonna herself asked if she should enter the room in an English accent that was fake, but the Foundation decided it wasn't a good time.

In "[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]", Stan claims that "renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs".

==Appearance==
Madonna seems excessively skinny, she is possibly anorexic, as referenced by Kenny. She also has a large head, a large nose, large lips, small eyes slathered in mascara and blue eye shadow, and sunken in cheeks. She wore a white crop top with the American flag in the shape of a "2" at its center as well as a white skirt with what resembled the brown patches commonly seen on cows. This outfit is most likely based on costumes she wore during the ''Music'' era.
