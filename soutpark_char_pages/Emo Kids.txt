The''' Emo Kids''' is a group that first appear in [[Season Seventeen]] episode "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]". The group was briefly cited earlier in "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]".

==Background==
[[Henrietta]]'s parents show concern for her behavior and call her emo, making Henrietta angry since they don't know the difference between goths and emos. They send her to a camp that they think might help her be a normal person. When Henrietta returns from camp, [[Michael]], [[Pete]], and [[Firkle]] are startled to find that she has become an emo. 

When Michael goes to Henrietta's room to tell her about the camp having turned her into an emo, Henrietta tells Michael that someday the emos would take over the world. After Michael tells Pete about what happened, [[Michael's Parents|his parents]] forcefully send him to the same camp as Henrietta because they think he was emo too. 

Pete and Firkle decide to ask for help from the [[Vampire Kids]]. They go to [[Henrietta]]'s house to show the Vamp Kids what Henrietta had become. The Vamp Kids' leader, [[Mike Makowski|Mike]], has the idea of summoning [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to help them "break the spell" of the Emo Kids. Meanwhile, a camp gardener tells Michael (who was trapped in a chair) that the camp plants were turning the kids into emos. Michael discovers that the gardener works for those plants. 

Pete, Firkle, Mike, Edgar, and an [[Unnamed Black Vampire|Vamp Kid]] plan to the camp to rescue Michael and set fire to the place. When they arrive at camp and are about to rescue Michael, Firkle reveals that he is an emo and points a gun at them. He and the gardener then lock everyone in chairs with a plant so that they can be turned into emos. Edgar Allan Poe appears and shoots the "leader plant" and finds that the plants were purchased at Lowe's Home and Garden. The gardener then discovers that everything was actually a joke created by his wife. Michael and Pete come to Henrietta's house to tell her that it was all a hoax and that she had become an emo on her own.

Henrietta is overweight and has medium length straight hair that is parted in the center. She wears a black dress, a necklace with the cross on it, and black finger-less gloves.

According to [[Larry]], Sarah Collins was part of the [[Vampire Kids|Vamp Kids]] two weeks ago, so it may be that she is the third most recent kid to have become emo. She has long blonde hair with black highlights and wears a black shirt with a picture of a skull on the right side, gray pants, and black shoes.
