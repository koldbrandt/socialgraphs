The '''Tardicaca Camp Counselors''' are counselors at [[Lake Tardicaca]], a summer camp for disabled children. They first appear in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, "[[Crippled Summer]]".

==Background==
The counselors run the camp throughout the episode. The campers compete in competitions divided into a red and blue team. The events include: swimming, archery, scavenger hunt, 50-yard dash, three legged race, bear hunting, basketball, surfing, canoeing, and a talent show. [[Steve]] is the leader of the camp counselors.

==Appearance==
They are of varying appearances but all wear the Lake Tardicaca camp t-shirt and shorts.

==''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''==
The counselors became a fairly important plot point in ''[[Bring the Crunch]]'', where they are essential to keep the Camp at Lake Tardicaca alive. Knowing this, in an attempt to destroy the camp, [[Nathan]] decided to let [[Mimsy]] tie them up and to hire thugs to scare children away.

However, Mimsy mistook Nathan's command as an assassination order, and started murdering counselors. [[Fastpass]], [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], [[Mintberry Crunch]] are determined to stop this and save the camp. One of the counselors committed suicide after he realized he subjected children to penile imagery, and two counselors were gravely injured before their painful demise. 

Finally, the last female counselor survived the murder and the alien abduction, and proceed to get ready for the camp.
