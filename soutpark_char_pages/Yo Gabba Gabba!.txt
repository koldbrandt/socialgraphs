'''Yo Gabba Gabba!''' is a group of colorful monster characters who star in the children's educational television show ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' The members are Foofa, Muno, Brobee, Toodee, and Plex. They play a major role in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[Taming Strange]]".

==Background==
In an attempt to rekindle his relationship with his brother, [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] takes him to a ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' concert. At the concert, Ike goes onstage and "tames Foofa's strange", much to the horror of the other Gabbas and the audience. Foofa then leaves the group, desiring to become "edgier" and have more "sex appeal", despite protests from the others. Foofa goes on to smoke pot, party, and arranges a raunchy performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, with Ike as her manager. The other Gabbas try to convince her not to perform but to no avail. At the VMAs, Kyle manages to convince Ike that he's trying to grow up too fast, and they reconcile. Foofa, however, is unmoved by this. She reveals her dominatrix outfit and proceeds to perform as the others watch in horror and disappointment.
