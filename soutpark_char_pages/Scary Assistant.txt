The '''Scary Assistant''' is a member of [[Rob Reiner's Smoke Stoppers]], who appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Butt Out]]".

He is seen offering [[Eric Cartman]] a cupcake, that is presumably poisoned, in an effort to kill him after filming the anti-smoking commercial. This was an attempt to pin Eric's would-be-death on lung cancer due to smoking.

==Appearance==
He wears a black cloak with the Smoke Stopper symbol and a belt. He has black hair and very pale skin. He always has his hands down during the episode. His appearance is similar to Gríma Wormtongue or Dracula due to his pale skin and cloak.
