'''Estella Havisham''' is a character from the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[Pip]]". She is a literary counterpart from Charles Dickens' classic tale, ''Great Expectations''. Estella is [[Miss Havisham]]'s daughter. She was raised to break men's hearts.

==Background==
Estella first meets Pip after he answers a job offer in the newspaper. Pip is hired by Miss Havisham to be a playmate with Estella. She is very surprised to find that her game of "whack the blond boy over the head with a log" is one that Pip and his sister play often. Estella treats Pip cruelly, calling him many nasty names. Though she is cruel, Pip still falls in love with her.

After being sent away to become a gentleman, Pip reunites with Estella. He tells Estella that he believes that he is in love with her, but is heartbroken to find that she has a seventeen year old boyfriend who already owns a car. Pip soon discovers that Estella was raised to break men's hearts so that the tears from all of her ex-boyfriends could be used to fuel a machine which would combine Miss Havisham's soul with Estella's body.

Pip tries to convince Estella that she is not cold-hearted by giving her a baby bunny. Estella breaks the bunny's neck, and Pip offers another (which she also kills). Estella continues to kill the bunnies offered to her by Pip, but stops after the twenty fifth. Pip claims that she has a heart due to her inability to kill twenty six baby bunnies and unhooks her from Miss Havisham's machine. Miss Havisham dies in a fire resulting from the machine malfunctioning, and Estella accepts her love for her "small testicled darling".

It is not stated to whether Pip and Estella's relationship continued after the episode, though it is highly unlikely since Pip has moved to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

A possible second appearance as a boss, named "Blooderella," was to taken place in ''Stick of Truth'' during the cut [https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:100893 vampire quest].

==Appearance==
Estella is a Caucasian girl with long, wavy blond hair. She has rosy cheeks and dresses very wealthy. She wears a green dress and a dark pink hat with a dark pink rose on it in the beginning of "Pip". Toward the end of the episode, she wears an off-the-shoulder white dress with a ribbon in the chest with a tiered ruffle pìnk skirt and a pink lei with pearls on her head. In Stick of Truth this was changed
