The '''Prince and Princess of Canada''' were seen in [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[Royal Pudding]]". They are both parodies of the real-life [[wikipedia:Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] and [[wikipedia:Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine]], the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The princess returns in "[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]", with the prince having a bigger role. The prince returns as well in [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Freemium Isn't Free]]".

==Background==
The prince and princess were seen performing the traditional Canadian Royal Wedding ceremony in "[[Royal Pudding]]"; the ceremony is a parody of the British Royal Wedding. During the first part of the ceremony, the princess was abducted by an energy cube that crashed the wedding. [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[Scott the Dick]], and [[Ugly Bob]] go after her, only to find out that the culprit was a hideous monster known as [[Tooth Decay]]. In the end, the princess was rescued and the ceremony was resumed.

The prince gets a major role in "[[Freemium Isn't Free]]", where he allows the [[Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming]] to create a mobile phone app that helps pay to rebuild Canada better by making a game free and addicting. He finds out this was caused by the deeds of the Canadian Devil, in which [[Satan]] helped rescue Canada. He tells the people of Canada that he learns his lesson and promises to never make Freemium games.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
The prince and princess appear in the game, when the [[Douchebag|New Kid]] arrives in Ottawa, Canada. The prince has imprisoned the Minister of Montreal in a cave and sends the New Kid to get the [[Bishop of Banff]]'s testicles to convince him to release the Minister. After obtaining the testicles, or a Dire Pig's to deceive, he goes back on the deal and instead friends the New Kid on [[Facebook]]. The princess goes behind the prince's back and sends the New Kid to Vancouver to talk to the Duke for more help.
