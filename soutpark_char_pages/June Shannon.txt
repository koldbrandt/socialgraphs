'''June Shannon''' is the mother of a reality television personality and frequent beauty pageant contestant, [[Alana Thompson]]. She appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Raising the Bar]]".

==Appearance==
June is obese and has brown hair, droopy eyes and worn teeth. She wears a green shirt and dark blue jeans. She speaks in a strong southern drawl. She has a large triple-neck and wears blush on her cheecks.

==Personality==
June acts like a typical "reality TV / show-business mother" - she spoils her daughter while pushing her to win beauty pageants, even telling her to keep going after just recovering from a heart attack. She exhibits low-class behavior and displays no shame for her conduct or appearance, leading Kyle to opine that the "bar has been lowered".

After the bar is raised, she expresses distaste at her daughter's actions and her own appearance.

==Trivia==
*The real life June Shannon [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/honey-boo-boo-south-park-parody-mama-june_n_1969718 did not find her portrayal amusing].
