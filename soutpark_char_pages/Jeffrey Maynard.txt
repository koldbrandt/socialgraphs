==Background==
[[The 4th Grade|The 4th graders]] are rehearsing for their [[The Miracle Worker|Thanksgiving play]] about Helen Keller. They are trying to put on a play as spectacular as possible, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] brings in Jeffrey Maynard as their supervisor. Cartman describes him as "South Park's biggest expert on musical theater" because he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks. He brings in [[Lamond]] the animal trainer who owns the feat-performing turkey [[Alinicia]]. During the play, [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] finds out that Lamond tricked him to let go of his disabled turkey [[Gobbles]]. Timmy leaves the show to look for Gobbles. As a result, Maynard fills in for Timmy's part of Helen Keller. To Cartman's chagrin, Maynard acts in his own way which includes singing, contrary to Hellen Keller being deaf, mute, and blind.

==Trivia==

Colm Wilkinson originated the role of Jean Valjean in ''[[wikipedia:Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' on the West End and Broadway. Most of Maynard's dialogue is sung to the tune of various songs from ''Les Misérables''.
