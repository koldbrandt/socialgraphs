'''Job''' is a Biblical character mentioned in the [[Hebrews]]' "Literature of Wisdom" corpus of the Bible. Most scholars believe he is a fictional character created to teach the readers about morals. Job lived in the Ancient Near East and is shown in a flashback in "[[Cartmanland]]".

==Background==
[[Kyle Broflovski]] pops his hemorrhoid on the barbed wire fence while waiting in line in [[North Park Funland]] which was bought by [[Eric Cartman]], infecting the sore and almost killing him. He is taken to [[Hells Pass Hospital]] where he denounces his faith completely, and [[Gerald Broflovski|his]] [[Sheila Broflovski|parents]]' description of the trials of Job who suffered despite being a good person does little to assure him, only resulting in him believing God is even worse.
