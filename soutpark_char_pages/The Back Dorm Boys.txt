'''Wei Wei''' and '''Huang Yixin''', also known as '''The Back Dorm Boys''', are a pair of internet celebrities famous for lip-syncing "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys. They appear in the background of the episode "[[Canada on Strike]]", as two of the internet celebrities waiting for their theoretical payments. They may or may not be deceased, as they were not seen fighting or dead.

==Appearance==
As in their video, they wear matching red Houston Rockets jerseys and the number 11 (Yao Ming) printed on them, along with black shirts and blue jeans. One (Wei Wei) also wears a white headband. Like other Asians on the show, they are portrayed with narrowed eyes.
