The '''Four-Assed Monkey''' is a genetically modified monkey and one of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]]'s most prized creations. It first appears in [[Season One]] episode, "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]".

==Background==
As [[The Boys]] embark on a tour in the [[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]], Dr. Mephesto showed them a four-assed monkey, claiming it will change the world for the better.

The monkey was used as [[Terrance Mephesto]]'s science project, now with five asses, who eventually lost the award to [[Fluffy]] when the latter gave birth to a piglet that resembles [[Herbert Garrison]].

In later appearances, it is again seen with four asses.

==Appearance==
As the name suggests, it is a brown monkey that was modified to have four asses, covering the base of its tail. Its head has three strands of black hair.

==Prominence==
*"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"
*"[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"
*"[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"
