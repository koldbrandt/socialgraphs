:''For the Dean of [[University of Colorado Boulder]], see [[Dean Howland]].''

'''Dean''' was the host of [[J&G Shopping Network]] who appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Cash For Gold]]". In the episode, he sold overpriced jewelry on his television show.

==Background==
Dean hosts a jewelry shopping channel where he sells exorbitantly expensive jewelry which he bought for a fraction of the cost he sells them for, usually to elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease. He is shown to receive his product from India, from a sweatshop that makes the jewelry.

Upon selling a piece of jewelry to an individual, they would then give it as a gift, usually to a relative. The relative would then take the jewelry to a [[Cash For Gold (Locations)|Cash For Gold]] shop to sell it at an extremely devalued price. The shop would go on to sell the gold to a smelter, who would then smelt the gold down into gold bars. The smelter would then send the gold to the sweatshop in [[India Manufacturing Inc.|India]], where it is turned back into jewelry. The sweatshop then sends the jewelry in crates back to Dean to be sold again, thus completing the cycle.

At the end of "[[Cash For Gold]]", Dean commits suicide on air, by a gunshot to the temple, after being told to by several callers. Although he himself was not seen, it was an extremely bloody death, as blood was seen covering his counter and products.

An old footage of Dean appearing in the shopping channel can be seen in "[[Basic Cable]]", when [[Scott Malkinson]]'s and [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s streaming service stops working.

==Appearance==
Dean was only shown behind a counter. However, he wore a white shirt with tribal designs and a black scarf. He had dark brown hair which had been combed back.
