'''Johnny Manymoons''' is a Native American comedian who appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Red Man's Greed]]".

==Background==
At the [[Three Feathers Indian Casino]], [[The Boys]]' parents force them to go to the comedy club at the casino since minors are not allowed on the casino floor. At the comedy club, Johnny Manymoons is seen performing stand-up comedy. Despite his jokes not being very funny or making any sense, the other Native American customers burst out in stereotypical chanting-like laughter, completely confusing The Boys.

==Appearance==
Johnny Manymoons has short black hair and black eyebrows. He wears a purple shirt with orange colors and a circular design on the shoulders over a green shirt. He also wears a brown belt with a gold buckle, black pants, and black shoes.
