'''Mr. Adams''' is a caseworker for Child Protective Services. He made his first appearance in "[[The Poor Kid]]".

==Background==
He was the caseworker for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and presumably, the other children fostered by [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead]]. Although his aim was to send the children to a better environment than their current one, he realized that it was a mistake sending them to live with [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead]], after seeing that one of the children had been water-boarded in [[The Punishment Room]].

He reappeared in the episode "[[The City Part of Town]]" at the [[Whole Foods Market]] along with many rarely seen characters from previous seasons.

In the video game ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], ''Mr. Adams appears and offers the player a reward if they post 8 of his headshots around the town. He also appears in the DLC ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'', where he is revealed to be [[Mike Makowski]]’s stepdad. When [[Mysterion]] and [[Douchebag|The New Kid]] interrupt Mike‘s birthday party at [[Casa Bonita]] to rescue Kenny’s sister [[Karen McCormick|Karen]], Mr. Adams dresses up as Keifer Sutherland from the 1980s film ''The Lost Boys'' and fights the children.

==Appearance==
Mr. Adams is a heavy set Caucasian male. He has a full, brown beard and mustache, and wears glasses. He wears olive-colored slacks, a red dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up, a yellow-orange tie, and a plain black belt. 

==Personality==
He cares for the children whose cases he works although he is naive, trusting foster parents completely. He is softhearted and cheerful and he routinely likes to tell jokes about the [[wikipedia:Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Penn State Scandal]]. When something happens that requires him to be assertive, he is, and when it's time to help the children, he becomes sincerely nice.

==Prominence==
*"[[The Poor Kid]]"
*"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]" - Seen at the back of the Child Protective Services room.
*"[[The City Part of Town]]"
*"[[Bike Parade]]"
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.
