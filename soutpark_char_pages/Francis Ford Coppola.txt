'''Francis Ford Coppola''' is an American filmmaker who appears in the episode, "[[Free Hat]]".

Coppola is one of the directors who is invited to see the premiere of the remastered ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' by [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]. However, the truly terrible opening scenes of the film cause his head to shrivel up and implode, in the same manner as Colonel Dietrich in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.

He also appears in the episodes "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" as one of the many celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

==Trivia==
*Coppola's manner of death is a parody of the death scene of [[w:c:indianajones:Herman Dietrich|Colonel Dietrich]], who died in a similar fashion during the finale of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.
*Late in the making of "[[Free Hat]]", [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] realized that they needed a third director for the finale. They chose Coppola because he had just announced that he was to release a new version of his classic film, ''Apocalypse Now'' (''Apocalypse Now Redux''). However, unlike the remastered versions of ''Star Wars'' and ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', Stone and Parker actually liked the changes made in ''Apocalypse Now Redux''.

==Prominence==
*"[[Free Hat]]" - Attends the premiere of the new version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and dies.
*"[[200]]" - Can be seen in the background as one of the celebrities suing South Park.
*"[[201]]" - Can be seen in the background as one of the celebrities suing South Park.
