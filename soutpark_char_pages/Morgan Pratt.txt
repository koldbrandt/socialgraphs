'''Morgan Pratt''' is a 4th grade little league batter for the [[Fort Collins (City)|Fort Collins]] baseball team. He appears in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[The Losing Edge]]".

==Background==
In "[[The Losing Edge]]", Morgan is first up to bat for his team. [[Stan Marsh]] is pitching, and throws Morgan's first strike, all the while [[Randy Marsh]] is hailing "Hey, Batter Batter" from the stands. With Morgan ignoring Cartman's demand to at least swing at the ball, Stan throws a ball to get him to walk to first base.

Morgan's eldest teammate tells Morgan to only swing if Stan throws a strike, much to his confusion. Stan attempts to throw a ball, but it is declared a strike, causing Cartman to yell at the umpire. Believing Stan's next pitch to be a ball, Morgan swings and hits the ball. He runs to first base with disappointment.

==Appearance==
Morgan wears a baseball uniform that is blue, orange, and white. He wears black shoes, and a blue and orange baseball helmet. His jersey is mostly blue, with orange trim. It has the team name "Fort Collins" on the front.
