'''Linda Cotner''' appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]", when her car breaks down in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] on the way to her husband's job interview.

==Background==
The children gets rid of all the adults by getting them arrested for molestation, taking control of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] which later breaks into two factions: [[SmileyTown]] and [[Treasure Cove]]. Linda and Mark's vehicle breaks down while in "SmileyTown", on the way to a job interview. They then walk into town for a phone and come to a garage, where they meet [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]. Butters tells them that they must go to Treasure Cove, where they will find a phone. They do so and are attacked and taken to the Mayor, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. He tells them to get a book from Treasure Cove, meaning someone from that side will have to be sacrificed for "Carousel".

Linda and Mark proceed to Treasure Cove, and are again attacked and taken to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. They tell him to get a book from Smiley Town. He does so and the clock chimes, meaning someone from Smiley Town must be sacrificed. Before Butters is sacrificed, Mark gives a speech about how parents are important, and the boys decide to tell the police that their parents did not really molest them. Mark tells Linda he thinks he wants children, but Linda disagrees and gets her tubes tied.

==Appearance==
Linda wears black shoes, a blue skirt, and a purple blouse.
