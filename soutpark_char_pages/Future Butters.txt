'''Future Butters''' is an actor hired by [[Motivation Corp.]] in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[My Future Self n' Me]]". He is intended to play as a future [[Butters Stotch]], whose life went downhill after doing drugs and alcohol. However, Butters found out that he was being deceived, with the help of [[Stan Marsh]].

==Background==
Future Butters came to the [[Stotch Residence]] four months before Stan's future self, [[Future Stan]] did. Future Butters tells his family about how he abused alcohol, and now must take a medicine to prevent liver failure. He also frequently watches a show called "Becker", much to the disdain of Butters.

Stan begins to put the pieces together when Butters tells him about Future Butters' coming. He exclaims to Butters that their parents have been lying to them and should be punished. The next day, both boys follow an address to a parental revenge business they had found in a newspaper ad. Upon arrival, they find out the business is run solely by [[Eric Cartman]].

Though their decision tentative, Stan and Butters agree to consult Eric for ideas. Eric gets Butters to agree with smearing his home's walls in fecal matter, but Stan chooses to leave when Eric doesn't offer a satisfactory punishment. After Butters' parents, [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] and [[Linda Stotch]], come back home with Future Butters, the redecoration makes them realize their mistakes and confess their lies to their son.

==Appearance==
True to his role, he appears to be an older but a slovenly version of Butters. He has a tuft of unkempt blonde hair, a turquoise T-shirt, and dark green pants. The major contrasting points in appearance to Butters, other than the obvious age difference, is his five o'clock shadow, pot belly, and blond eyebrows.
