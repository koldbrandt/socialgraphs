}}'''Boston''' is an American rock band formed by Tom Scholz in 1975. The band made a brief appearance in the [[Season Twenty]] episode "[[Skank Hunt]]".

==Background==
When [[Gerald Broflovski]] decides to take a night trolling message boards online as [[Skankhunt42]], he puts in a record that plays the Boston song [[Smokin']]. A montage is then shown of Gerald trolling, with him ending up on stage with the members of Boston at one point.

Smokin also plays during a portion of Season Twenty's finale "[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]", when [[Kyle Broflovski]] tries to overload the TrollTrace servers using his dad's Skankhunt42 account.

==Appearance==
All of the band members have mustaches, aside from guitarist Tom Scholz. They appear to have old 70s hairstyles.
