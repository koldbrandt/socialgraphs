The '''Toilet Safety Obese Agent''' is an agent for the [[Toilet Safety Administration]] who appears in [[Season Sixteen]] episode "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]".

==Background==
The agent's job scope is to monitor toilet users on several security cameras, alerting relevant authorities should he spot anyone breaching the new toilet safety rules. Unfortunately while on the job, he would masturbate with the use of moisturizing lotion.

In "[[Reverse Cowgirl]]", he finds [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who has a baby and a gun. Cartman then pulls a tied up TSA agent into the view of the camera, before spraying black paint onto the camera.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
The agent is encountered during [[The Thin White Line]] mission. [[The New Kid]] is required to get past the agent by dropping an overhead LCD television screen onto his head, knocking the agent out cold.

==Appearance==
The agent appears overweight and has balding gray hair. He wears the TSA uniform over an undersized white shirt and white sports shoes. There are chains strapped onto his left pocket.
