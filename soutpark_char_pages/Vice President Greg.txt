'''Vice President Greg''' appeared in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[Lice Capades]]", as a louse that lives in [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s hair. He serves as the main antagonist in the episode.

==Background==
The Vice President does not believe [[Travis Mayfield]], the louse protagonist, that the world (Clyde's body) is conscious. After Clyde washes his hair with the special shampoo given by the doctor, many lice are killed.

The Vice President survives the disaster and travels with Travis and a female louse to the forbidden zone in hopes of finding a new home. The three make it to safety, only for the Vice President to betray Travis by shooting the female louse in the head.

He then corners Travis and shoots him in both his knees and tells him that he will rebuild their destroyed village. He mocks Travis' theories of a living world and shoots the ground - in other words, Clyde's head. Only feeling a mild tingle, Clyde plucks the Vice President from his head and tosses him to his death.

==Appearance==
The Vice President is a louse. He has gray, receding hair and burns on major portions of his body from the lice removal shampoo.
