'''Some Puerto Rican Guy''' is an entirely fabricated criminal who is mentioned in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]".

==Background==
Some Puerto Rican guy was blamed for kidnapping and killing [[Butters Stotch]], [[JonBenét Ramsey]], [[O.J. Simpson]]'s wife, and [[Gary Condit]]'s intern. He was made the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]]'s number 1 most wanted criminal. [[Linda Stotch]] claimed him to be of average Puerto Rican height. 

Throughout the episode, it is implied that he is entirely fictional and was invented to cover up the fact that the individuals who claimed he was real were really the ones who murdered their relatives/lovers. The character is also satirical of racial stereotyping against minorities, especially in crime.
