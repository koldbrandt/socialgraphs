'''Kanye Omari West''' (also known as '''Ye'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58965500|title=Kanye West officially changes his name to Ye|publisher=BBC|date=October 19, 2021}}</ref>) is an American rapper and musician who first appears in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Fishsticks]]". He reappeared in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, "[[The Hobbit]]".

==Background==
Kanye does not understand the [[Fishsticks Joke]] and thinks that people are actually referring to him personally as a gay fish. He resorts to violent rages every-time someone attempts to explain the joke. He punches out a TV presenter and leaves the stage during a performance. When [[Carlos Mencia]] claims credit for writing the joke on the [[Conan O'Brien]] show, he kidnaps and murders the comedian while trying to get him to explain the meaning. Finding out [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Jimmy Valmer]] wrote the joke during their appearance on the [[Ellen DeGeneres]] talk show.

Kanye and his entourage hold Cartman and Jimmy hostage at Jimmy's house threatening to murder them if they do not tell him the reason for calling him a "gay fish". Jimmy and Cartman ignore the threats and fight about who wrote the joke, Kanye comes to the wrong conclusion and accepts that he is a literal "[[Gay Fish]]", mistaking the argument as if they were talking about him. At this point, a music video shows him diving into the sea where he begins humping and French-kissing other fish and sea animals.

Kanye returned in "[[200]]", still in his "gay fish" attire, to take part in the lawsuit against [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with all of the other celebrities.

In "[[The Hobbit]]", Kanye constantly tries to convince naysayers that his fiancée, [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]], is not a hobbit. However, he repeatedly calls her to clarify certain issues as her similarities to a hobbit become ever more apparent. He sings the song "[[My Bitch Ain't No Hobbit]]".

West makes a cameo on a poster in "[[REHASH]]".

===Deleted Scene===
In a deleted scene from "[[Fishsticks]]", the U.S. Coast Guard finds his drowned, bloated corpse in the ocean, revealing that Kanye's undersea sexual encounters were nothing more than hallucinations.

==Appearance==
Kanye West is an African American with close-cropped black hair and a dark skin tone. Prior to becoming a "gay fish", he wore red "shutter shades", a (presumably leather) jacket, a white shirt (with a partially-covered black design at its center), gray pants, and red-laced black and white sneakers. As a "gay fish", he wore a shiny green, skintight shirt, as well as aqua-green, skintight pants.
In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', he is depicted as a literal fish with shiny green scales. He still wears his signature golden chain.
