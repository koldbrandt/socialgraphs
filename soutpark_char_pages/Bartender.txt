The '''bartender''' is a minor townsperson and the former owner of [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails]] before it was inducted by [[Skeeter]], and changed to [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Wine Bar]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]". He used to be a more "important" character during the early seasons.

==Background==
Since his bar's most frequent patrons were generally close-minded and uninviting, the Bartender typically served as the straight man to them, regularly attempting to water down their hostility towards whoever they "didn't take kindly."

==Appearance==
The bartender wears a blue jacket with a pocket and a yellow pen on the right side, a brown belt with a gray buckle, pink pants and black boots, his coat buttons are blue when he is seen from the side. He has blond hair and a ponytail, a thick beard and is almost bald, he also has a yellow pencil in one ear. Bartender seems to be taller than most adults, perhaps because of his long legs. He looks a little overweight.

The bartender's appearance changed slightly in later seasons. Now he wears a dark blue jacket with white buttons, two side pockets and some brown details, a black belt with a yellow buckle and gray pants. He also had some yellow hair and unique eyebrows. Although his appearance has had a big change, he still keeps his legs long and unusual.

==Personality==
Placid, but stern, the bartender is easy-going and relaxed. He is authoritative when it comes to keeping his customers under control, and tranquil. He seems to be the only peaceful redneck in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

==Trivia==
*He and [[Hat McCullough]] have a very similar body type. Their legs are distinguishable from those of other ''[[South Park]]'' characters.
