[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] tries to explain to him that the Laboratory was stupid, but Cartman goes to Spooky Laboratory anyway. When he enters the Spooky Laboratory, he meets Dr. Spookalot, who puts a blindfold on Cartman's eyes while putting him to run his hand over the "bowl of human eyeballs", which was actually just a bowl of eggs, a bowl of lemon gelatin, which Dr. Spookalot claimed to be the brain, and on the ass of a donkey, which he said was to be the warm bowels of the body.
