'''P. Diddy''' is an American rapper who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[Douche and Turd]]". 

==Background==
Kyle Broflovski hires P. Diddy to persuade an indifferent [[Stan Marsh]] by instilling the fear of violence to make him vote for a new school mascot. P. Diddy performed his song "[[Vote or Die!]]" in a video montage of him and his gang violently chasing Stan, threatening to slit his throat and having five guns pointed at Stan while using profanity.

After he is banished from the town for not voting, he is then sent on a donkey with a bucket over his head when they come onto a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] community. P. Diddy and his crew somehow locate him to follow through on his threats. Then, A PETA member throws pig blood on him for wearing fur. Enraged, he gives his group the signal to start slaughtering everyone. A stray bullet ended up hitting Stan in his shoulder.

==Personality==
P. Diddy appears to favor violence to get his way with others and murders a group of people for having different ideals about love than himself. Seems to really care about voting even to the point of murder. When about to rap he speaks like a typical rapper, but when talking to his posse he speaks with a regal and posh accent.
