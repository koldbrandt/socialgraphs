The '''Girl with Blonde Hair''' is an unnamed [[List of Female 4th Graders|4th-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]] who first appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[The List]]".

==Background==
She first appears in "[[The List]]" when the girls were discussing which girl has the cutest purse. When [[Millie Larsen]] submitted her opinion on two girls' purses, she responded to Millie by saying, ''"I don't think anyone disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Theresa's, but that doesn't make it the cutest."'' [[Bebe]] then explains that the committee had already agreed that purses with stripes couldn't be in the top five cutest purses.

In "[[Elementary School Musical]]", she was shown talking to [[Annie Knitts]] before [[The Boys|the boys]] sang their song at the end.

In "[[Super Fun Time]]", she was shown many times in the background. In "[[The Ring]]", she and her two sisters watch the [[Jonas Brothers]]' 3D concert on TV with their parents.

==Appearance==
She has short blonde hair that does a half-curl to the side at the bottom. She wears a navy blue coat with black buttons running down the front. She also wears a black skirt, which is rare among the 4th-grade girls, as [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red]], [[Annie Knitts]], [[Millie Larsen]], etc. all all wear pants. The only regular background girls to wear skirts are [[Allie Nelson]] and [[Theresa]].

==Personality==
The girl with blonde hair was portrayed as business-like in "[[The List]]", calmly arguing over who's purse is the cutest. However, this behavior is likely due to the committee itself and its rules, as all girls act similar while meeting.

==Family==
[[File:Jennysimon-family.png|thumb]] 
In "[[The Ring]]", her family is shown as a very devout Christian family. She also has two sisters. One of her sisters appears to be [[Jenny Simons]], and she also has another sister. It is revealed that her name is Katie when her father addresses her in "[[The Ring]]". She is very young, possibly around three or four years old.

===The Foley Family===
[[File:Foley_Family.png|thumb]]
It was shown that the girl with blonde hair's father is actually Mr. Foley, the father of the three ginger kids in "[[Ginger Kids]]". The mother and youngest daughter are also members of the Foley clan. The mother's design, with the exception of the blond hair, is the same as before, even seen knitting just like the last episode. The youngest daughter was also once a ginger. This was most likely a case where the creators recycled a few character models.

==Interactions==
===[[Annie Knitts]]===
In "[[Elementary School Musical]]", she is seen with Annie nearly every time she is shown. It is assumed they are friends.
===Popular Girls Clique===
She is represented as a semi-popular girl that is not part of Wendy's group of popular girls, but may be part of her extended group, because she is friends with some of the girls in Wendy's group. In "[[Elementary School Musical]]", when the whole school was singing, she was shown again singing beside Annie. It is displayed that these two are fairly good friends, and with Annie being popular, she is likely somewhat popular as well.
