'''Dramatic Look Gopher''' appeared in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[Canada on Strike]]", as one of the internet celebrities waiting for their theoretical payments.

==Background==
It appears that the gopher's gaze can cause severe brain damage. The Dramatic Look Gopher was shot by [[Tay Zonday]], who in turn made him explode.

Although the video is called "Dramatic Chipmunk", the character is referred to as "Dramatic Look Gopher" in the episode. It is famous for staring directly at a camera as it zooms in on its face while dramatic music plays.

==Appearance==
Dramatic Look Gopher is a brown haired gopher. He is not anthropomorphic and has no distinguishing features.

==Trivia==
*He and the [[Numa Numa Guy]] are the only Internet characters that have their original voice (or sound).
*Despite being called a gopher, chipmunk, and a squirrel, it's actually a prairie dog.
*This character and its internet meme were originated from a Japanese variety television show ''Hello! Morning featuring Minimoni'' where the cropped and zoomed-in clip shows a prairie dog inside the transparent box being shown to the hosts in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=dhy0tIbGs_0|title=Horrorbeaver.
