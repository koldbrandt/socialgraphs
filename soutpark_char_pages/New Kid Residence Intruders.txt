The '''New Kid Residence Intruders''' are a group of three men who intruded [[The New Kid's Residence]] in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

==Background==
In all four of the Origins mission line, the story (as narrated by [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]) was that the intruders broke into the house to attempt to hurt [[the New Kid]]'s parents. Through a tutorial on the selected [[Classes|class]], the New Kid takes down the intruders in each of the four missions. It was revealed in [[Farts of Future Past]] that the intruders' true intention was to obtain a selfie with the New Kid.

Percy (also known as the Alpha Intruder while in combat) wears a large red cap, and brown jacket with a navy blue shirt underneath, black gloves, a pair of black pants and black sports shoes. Percy has a large scar running along the left side of his face.

James wears a navy blue cap, grey jacket, black gloves, a pair of denim, and black shoes.

Jesse is usually seen carrying a crowbar. He wears a black beanie, black collared shirt, grey pants and black boots.

*'''Wicked Crowbar''' - Jesse flings a crowbar onto the New Kid.
*'''Vicious Crowbar''' - James flings a crowbar onto the New Kid.
*'''Home Invader Special''' - Exclusive to Percy. Punches the New Kid five times.
