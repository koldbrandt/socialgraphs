[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] goes to talk to Cartman about the Vaping Man, asking Cartman how much he owes his vaping dealer.

Later on, the Vaping Man crashes through the fence of the [[Mackey Residence]] when Kyle tries talking to Cartman and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], angrily asking them where his money is.
