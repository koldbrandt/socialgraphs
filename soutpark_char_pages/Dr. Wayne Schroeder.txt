'''Dr. Wayne Schroeder''' is a psychologist who appears in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Skank Hunt]]", where he was seen delivering a presentation to parents about internet trolls and [[Skankhunt42]].

==Background==
Schroeder's presentation is titled ''"Is my child a TROLL?"''. He begins by discussing [[Nancy Turner]]'s vandalized photo online. Turner's image was vandalized by the troll because she defended her [[Heidi Turner|daughter]]'s right to sit down during the national anthem. Dr. Schroeder, believing Skankhunt42 is a student, asks all parents to look for signs that their children may be the troll.

==Appearance==
Schroeder wears a light blue shirt with two pockets and pocket protectors. His left shirt pocket holds a red and a black pen. He also wears a red, striped tie. He has gray hair, is mostly bald, but has a small tuft of hair on the top of his head.
