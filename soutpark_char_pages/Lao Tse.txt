'''Lao Tse''' is the founder of Taoism and a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]. He was a Chinese philosopher. He has psychic powers of persuasion. His voice is very similar to [[Tuong Lu Kim]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Super Best Friends]]".

==Appearance==
Lao Tse, as he appears in [[South Park]], wears a pink robe, a red belt, and white shoes. He has gray hair but is balding, and a long gray beard. He can usually be seen wielding a wooden staff, which is longer in length than Lao Tse's height. He has stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes.
