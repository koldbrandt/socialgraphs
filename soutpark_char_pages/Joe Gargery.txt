==Family==
===[[Pip Pirrip]]===
Joe has taken Pip on as his apprentice and wishes to teach him in the trade of being a blacksmith. When the lawyer from London comes to take Pip to be a gentleman, he appears to be disappointed that Pip is leaving him to be a gentleman rather than a blacksmith, but appears genuinely happy for Pip, remarking that Pip is "A young gentleman of great expectations!"
===[[Mrs. Joe Gargery]]===
His short-tempered wife, Pip's grown sister, is dismissive towards him and his work, often being obnoxious and abusive towards him as well as disparagingly calling him things like "metal-pounding fairy".

==Trivia==
*One of the things Gargery creates is a metal orange. This is likely a reference to the novella ''A Clockwork Orange'' by Anthony Burgess, which was adapted into a film starring [[Malcolm McDowell]], who appeared as the narrator of the episode.
