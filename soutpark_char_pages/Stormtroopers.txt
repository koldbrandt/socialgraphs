'''Stormtroopers''' are characters in the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are typically portrayed as soldiers or guards and are often highly revered in the ''Galactic Empire''.

==Background==
Stormtroopers first appeared in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", where they were seen in the background chasing [[Butters Stotch]]. They next appeared, briefly, in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[The China Probrem]]", where [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] were seen raping one. In the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Obama Wins!]]", two Stormtroopers can be seen escorting a captured [[Eric Cartman]] to be interrogated by [[Mickey Mouse]].

==Appearance==
Stormtroopers have white armor with a utility belt and a grappling hook attached to it. Their armor protects their entire bodies, including their head. and provides functions such as cranial protection, filtered air, blaster protection, temperature controls, and much more. They can be typically seen wielding "E-11 blaster rifle",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/E-11_blaster_rifle|title=E-11 blaster rifle on Wookieepedia}}</ref> an energy weapon serving as the standard issue weapon of Imperial stormtroopers in the ''Star Wars'' universe.

==Trivia==
*In "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]", [[Kevin Stoley]] can be seen dressed as a Stormtrooper, whilst the other children were dressed as ''Lord of the Rings'' characters.
*In "[[Free Hat]]", several Stormtrooper helmets can be seen in George Lucas' house.
*In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]", a stormtrooper head is seen being displayed in Creepy City Costumes & Novelties.
*In "[[The Scoots]]", a stormtrooper costume is seen being sold at the [[Halloween Outlet]].
*In "[[Band in China]]", the stormtroopers are being replaced by [[Stormtroopers (First Order)|First Order stormtroopers]], a successor.
*Interestingly, in the Imaginationland trilogy, a Stormtrooper is seen in the good side of Imaginationland when the boys arrive in Imaginationland, yet in the other parts of the trilogy, the other Stormtroopers are seen on the evil side of Imaginationland during the part where one torments Strawberry Shortcake with the other evil characters, and when the evil characters are planning on what to do with Imaginationland after breaking down the wall that splits the two sides of Imaginationland. It could be possible that the one seen on the good side was Han Solo.
