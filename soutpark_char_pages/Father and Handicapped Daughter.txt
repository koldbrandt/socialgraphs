The '''father and Handicapped Daughter''' appear in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, "[[Fort Collins]]".

==Background==
The internet history of the residents of [[Fort Collins (City)|Fort Collins]] has been hacked and made public by [[TrollTrace.com]]. This enables the father to track down [[Anthony Webster|MLKKK]], the troll who called his handicapped daughter "R2-D2". At home, MLKKK gets a phone call from an unknown caller, the father, who says "I know where you live now you son-a bitch". MLKKK flees his home in terror. After crashing into the car in front of him, he is confronted by the father. The father says that he has waited a long time for this day. He then pours a bucket of gasoline onto MLKKK and sets him on fire. The daughter asks, "Is he burning, Pa?!" The father replies, "He's burning bright, little girl."
