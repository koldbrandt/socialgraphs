'''Blink-182''' is an American pop-punk band seen in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Christian Rock Hard]]".

==Background==
The band was one of several musical celebrities that joined [[The Boys|the boys]]' band, [[Moop]], in their strike against illegal music downloading.

Although this is their only appearance as a group, they were mentioned in the episode "[[The Snuke]]", when the boys are finding information about the new student, [[Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem]]. Hakeem's [[MySpace]] profile states that his favorite band is The White Stripes, while he told everyone in class that his favorite band was Blink-182. This leads Cartman to conclude that Baahir was lying, and thus likely to be a terrorist.

They are again referenced a few episodes later in "[[Le Petit Tourette]]" when [[Thomas]] uses the "CuteBilly182" moniker to attract older men to the ''Dateline'' Studio.

Travis Barker appears alone in the [[Season Twelve]] episode "[[Britney's New Look]]" at the 2007 MTV music awards.
