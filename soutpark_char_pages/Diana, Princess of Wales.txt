'''Diana, Princess of Wales''' was an immensely popular member of the British Royal Family, married to Prince Charles and mother of Princes William and Harry. She made her first appearance in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]".

==Background==
After her death in a car accident where her drunk driver was being chased by paparazzi, she made her first appearance as a resident of [[Hell]] in "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]" joining in on [[Satan]]'s song "[[Christmas Time in Hell]]". She was seen kissing [[Gene Siskel]] under a burning mistletoe.

She is one of the guests who attend Satan's luau party and sing "[[Hukilau]]" in "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]".

She also appeared in "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", in which she along with all her friends of Hell were invited to [[Satan]]'s Sweet 16-like birthday party on Earth. She along with everyone else was extremely excited, and since the party was costume only, she proceeded to dress up as Lara Croft of ''Tomb Raider''. However, she along with everyone else began to grow annoyed with Satan when he began acting like a spoiled brat.

==Appearance==
In "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]", Diana wore a pink dress, white shoes, and a silver necklace. Her face is a cut out of a picture of the real Princess Diana.

In "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" Diana wore a silver dress with white sequins, a silver necklace with a blue jewel, and silver earrings with similar jewels in them. Her head was animated with lots of makeup and it had blonde wavy hair as she did in real life.

==Trivia==
[[File:Siskeldiana.JPG|thumb|right|Princess Diana in "[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"]]
*It is assumed that, like the other 'nice' people in hell (i.e. [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), she is simply there because she was not a Mormon; who, for a long time, were the only people who could get into Heaven.
*Despite living in Hell, Diana seems to rather content apparently having a close friendship with [[Satan]].
*When she first appeared Diana's character had a real-world photo used for her head. However, like a majority of celebrities, she was later re-designed to be fully animated.
