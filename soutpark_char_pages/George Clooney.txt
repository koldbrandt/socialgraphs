'''George Clooney''' is an American actor and filmmaker who was featured in "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]", "[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]" and "[[Smug Alert!]]".

==Background==
George Clooney was an early supporter of the beginning of ''South Park'' by e-mailing the "[[The Spirit of Christmas]]" to some of his friends. This helped the video become one of the first "viral videos" on the internet back in 1995.

==Appearance==
When two years later ''South Park'' debuted on [[Comedy Central]] the creators cast him as a "gay dog" named [[Sparky]] that runs away from home and joins [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]].

A year later Mr. Clooney received a speaking role in the feature film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' as [[Dr. Doctor]].

Only a recording was used in "[[Smug Alert!]]", taken from George's acceptance speech at the 78th Academy Awards which was put into a dark "Smug Cloud" that took over the West Coast.

==Quotes==
*'''Stan:''' "Don't be gay, Sparky."<br />'''Sparky:''' "Woof?"
*'''Doctor Gouache:''' "We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about three seconds to live." - While operating on Kenny.
*'''Doctor Gouache:''' "It never gets any easier!" - Walking away from the operating table while whistling.

==Prominence==
*"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"
*"[[Smug Alert!]]"
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - A real life photo of George Clooney is seen on [[Bob White]]'s [[QAnon]] board as well as a South Park-style version of him when the [[Female QAnon Tutor]] explains the Hollywood elites to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]].

==Trivia==
*[[Trey Parker]] said that the story for Stan's dog running away came from personal experience when he was young.
*George was rumored one of the friends to be given with ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'' video tape.
*When Keenan Williams says, " If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction." This is a reference to the movie George starred in named ''The Perfect Storm'', which also explains why George was a storm cloud.
*George Clooney's role as a bad doctor is a reference to his popular role as Dr. Doug Ross on the TV series ''ER'' from 1994 to 2000 and once in 2009.
*The Smug Cloud is a pun of Smog Cloud which is caused by carbon dioxide pollution in the upper atmosphere.
*George Clooney has stated that he was not offended by his portrayal in "[[Smug Alert!]]".
