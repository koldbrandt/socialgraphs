}}{{LinkDisambig|Bill (Disambiguation)}}
'''Bill Allen''' is a student at [[South Park Elementary]] who is often seen with [[Fosse McDonald]]. Both boys are similar to ''Beavis and Butt-head'', describing things as "gay" then laughing in a deep voice.

==Appearance==
Bill wears a blue shirt similar to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' except with a white collar and pocket. He also wears black pants and matching gloves. His hair is similar to [[Terrance Mephesto]]'s, although it is brown and slightly shorter. He has thick eyebrows during the first four seasons, but was later redesigned and given regular ones.
{{GallerySubPage|name=Bill Allen}}

==Personality==
Bill is a bully, often laughing at things and people. In addition, he thinks everything is gay. Due to his seeming stupidity, it appears he did not make it to the fourth grade - he is never seen in the fourth grade classroom, but is in the halls, and is only seen in the hallway and playground after the second season. His voice appears to sound almost the same as [[Fosse]]'s. He was seen again in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]" when the boys discovered he, along with Fosse, stole [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll. He then played along and was "shot" in the game.

Bill seems to be one of the more naive children in the school along with Fosse, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Jason White|Jason]], and [[DogPoo Petuski]]. In the episode "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", he was part of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s group to help capture and lock up [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. It seems that unlike most other kids, ([[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Token Black|Token]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]) who are more aware of Cartman's manipulating methods, he still hasn't wised up to it and so that is why Cartman would most likely seek him out for help.

==Family==
[[File:Damien058.png|thumb|Bill and Fosse's fathers.]]
Due to Bill's quick phasing out from the series, his family was never officially seen. In the episode "[[Damien]]", [[Mr. Allen|two older]] [[Mr. McDonald|men]] are seen in the bar after [[Jesus]] storms out, saying "This show's gay" followed by "Yeah, gay" in the similar style to Bill and Fosse, while also having the same face and clothes but adult bodies. In the commentary of the episode, it was revealed that these two characters were indeed Bill and Fosse's parents. Bill's dad actually has a line in "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]" where he is one of the parents that drives by and makes fun of [[Mr. Mackey]]. Bill can be seen in the episode "[[Best Friends Forever]]" with an adult woman who could be his mother.

==Trivia==
*Bill is seen playing on the school's basketball team in "[[Elementary School Musical]]", one of the few times he appears without Fosse.
*Bill was a part of Cartman's entourage to eliminate [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]". Although he didn't speak, it's arguably his first major appearance since "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".
*Bill and Fosse are referred to by Matt and Trey within the scripts and commentaries as "the Nerds", "the Bullies" and the "That's Gay Kids" – they actually rarely use the duo's real names.
*Outside of "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]" he is never seen in the classroom seats with Fosse - Bill is often there into the third season, and Fosse would occasionally reappear. Bill once appeared in 4th Grade Classroom B, but Fosse did not appear with him.
*Bill's voice sounds similar to [[Kevin McCormick]]'s, and vice versa.
*In "[[T.M.I.]]", his name was revealed on the chart as Bill Allen.
*In "[[Lice Capades]]" a person looking similar to Bill was seen lining up in the 5th grade line.
*While not a direct relation, Bill is often seen standing with [[Annie Knitts]] in background appearances rather than with Fosse, making it one of a few times a character involved in a duo is with another character.
*Along with [[Scott Malkinson]] and [[Timmy Burch]], Bill is one of the few children on the show who has visible ears.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Bill and Fosse are minor characters in the game. They participate in the attack on [[South Park Elementary]] and Clyde's fortress alongside the player. Both of them are seen being attacked by three elves, and they befriend the player after he saves them. Bill makes only one Facebook post, and it says "You're gay!"

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Bill can be found with Fosse at the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] bar. When interacted with, Fosse says, "Sorry, you're not my type" with regards to the player, Bill then responds with, "Yeah, he's taken", referring to Fosse. This could been seen as confirmation that Bill and Fosse are (somewhat ironically) in a relationship with one another; or it may simply be seen as the duo engaging in another example of their "that's gay" routine.

The New Kid can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Blaster|blaster]] ability.
