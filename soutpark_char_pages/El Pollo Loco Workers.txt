The '''[[El Pollo Loco]] workers''' appear in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]".

==Background==
When [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] (dressed up as "Mantequilla") is dropped off to El Pollo Loco by [[Mr. and Mrs. Whipple]], he is taken into the restaurant by the workers. Upon hearing that Butters is "Mantequilla", the workers recognize him from posters which [[the boys]] had erected. They then begin to question their place in the [[United States]], misinterpreting Butters' desire to "cross the border", which ultimately led them to their decision to return to [[Mexico]].

Along with Mantequilla, the workers make their way to a nearby hospital, rallying other Mexican workers to return to Mexico as well.
