'''Buddha (शाक्यमुनि)''' is the founder of Buddhism and a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]], who first appeared in the [[Season Five]] episode, "[[Super Best Friends]]". 
==Appearance==
Buddha has blond hair in a bun. He wears a black beaded necklace and an orange robe. As of "[[200]]", Buddha has a newer appearance. His skin, hair, and robe are slightly darker in color and there are two yellow strands of fabric attached to the sleeve of his robe.

==Personality==
He is shown to be heroic, being a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]. This is further evidenced by him trying to help defeat [[David Blaine]]. 

In the "[[200]]" and "[[201]]", he is shown to be addicted to drugs, evidenced by his cocaine-snorting activities which made Jesus upset at him. The "200" episode shows him doing his drug session in front of the Super Best Friends as well as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] to which [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] furiously tells him "Buddha don't do coke in front of kids". He appeared again in the "201" episode wherein he does his drug session again and Jesus, already furious about this, orders him to stop as it was getting to be a problem wherein Buddha argues with him about pornography.

==Powers and Abilities==
He is said to have the power to turn himself invisible, but he's never shown to perform this. He also has the power of flight.

==Prominence==
*"[[Super Best Friends]]" - Buddha's debut and first major role. He helped defeat [[David Blaine]].
*"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]" - He was in the audience singing the reprise of "[[Bleeding Heart Rock Protest Song vs. Pro War Country Song]]" at the end.
*"[[Imaginationland]]" - In the background, he was one of the inhabitants of ''Imaginationland''.
*"[[200]]" - As a member of the ''The Super Best Friends'' discussed the controversy about the negative depictions of [[Muhammad]] in art and other media.
*"[[201]]" - Continuing from the previous episode, Buddha and the rest of the Super Best Friends saved Muhammad from kidnapping by the [[Ginger Separatist Movement|Ginger Kids]] and [[Tom Cruise]].
* "[[The Pandemic Special]]" - Appears on [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s lunchbox with the other [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]] including uncensored [[Muhammad]].

==Trivia==
*The scenes from "[[200]]" and "[[201]]" which depicted Buddha snorting cocaine made Sri Lanka ban the South Park series.
