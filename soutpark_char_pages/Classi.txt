==Personality==
Classi is dedicated to whomever pays her. She was Nathan's girlfriend, until he slapped her and told her to shut up, similarly to how he would treat [[Mimsy]]. She has strength as well, as she easily beats up Nathan during the breakup. But she is compassionate, as she unties [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and takes him to the gun show.

==Relationships==

In "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]", Nathan hired her to be his girlfriend with the money he received from helping [[Leslie Meyers|Leslie]] and the ads. Their relationship ended abruptly after she was slapped by him in a similar way to Mimsy, for which she violently assaulted him.

===[[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]===
She does not have much of a relationship with Jimmy at first. However, after Nathan slaps her, she goes on to help Jimmy stop the advertisements. She teams up with him and [[Officer Barbrady]] at the gun show, in order to alert [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] about Leslie.

==Prominence==
*"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]" - Introduced as Nathan's girlfriend. Gets Jimmy to the gun show.
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end of the episode celebrating that she has been vaccinated against [[COVID-19]].

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
During [[The Bowels of the Beast]] mission, [[Captain Diabetes]] and the New Kid try to chase after Classi in the Peppermint Hippo. After fighting past other [[Strippers]], chefs of [[Buca De Faggoncini]] and [[Randy Marsh|Red Wine Drunk Randy]], Classi was finally surrounded by the [[Coon and Friends]] who then asked her of the missing cat Scrambles for its reward money. Initially reluctant to give them the information, but after the New Kid delivers her medication, she finally reveals that the missing cats are being hidden in [[U-STOR-IT]] .

Later in [[The Thin White Line]] mission, she was almost fed to the elder god [[Shub-Niggurath]], being rescued just in time by the superheroes. Following the events in [[Park County Police Station]], she thanked the New Kid and offered to help them in combat, unlocking a Summon.
