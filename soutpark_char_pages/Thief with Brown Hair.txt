He and the rest of Bandits arrive in [[Pioneer Village]] to evade the police after robbing a Burger King. He and fellow Burger King Bandit [[Orlich]] close the gate to the village. He then assists the others in suppressing and keeping watch over the village employees and [[South Park Elementary]]'s [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade]] class, who were there on a field trip. After another member, [[Vosky]] warns that the police are coming in the village, he runs away.
