'''Zazul''' is a demon from [[Hell]] and one of [[Satan]]'s minions who makes his first appearance as a background character in the [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Best Friends Forever]]".

==Background==
In "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]", Zazul appears among more of Satan's minions when he tells them about a party he is having on Earth. He later introduces the Three Killers, [[Ted Bundy]], [[John Wayne Gacy]], and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and tells them to pick up Satan's [[Ferrari Cake]] for the party. He also appears wearing a schoolgirl costume but is told to take it off by Satan because Satan himself wants to wear the schoolgirl costume. He appears when an Acura Cake is unveiled due to a problem with the Ferrari Cake and is smacked away by an angry Satan.

==Appearance==
Zazul has dark red skin, large wings, two small horns on his head, small yellow eyes, and sharp teeth. His normal outfit consists of black and gray body armor. As a schoolgirl, he wears a blonde wig with pink bows in it, a gray and white top that is tied up high, a plaid skirt, white leggings, and black high-heeled shoes.

==Prominence==
*"[[Best Friends Forever]]" - Seen having his body armor put on him for the battle.
*"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]" - A model of him can be seen on top of [[Jenkins]]' television.
*"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" - He appears as a schoolgirl but is told to take the costume off so Satan can wear it.
