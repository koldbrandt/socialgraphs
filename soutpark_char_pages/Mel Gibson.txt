'''Mel Gibson''' is an American actor and film director, known for roles in films such as ''Braveheart'' and ''The Patriot'', and for his movie ''The Passion of the Christ''. He is depicted in ''[[South Park]]'' as utterly and violently insane, lacking any reason or sanity. He first appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, "[[The Passion of the Jew]]".

==Background==
Gibson is featured prominently in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]", in which [[the boys]] see ''The Passion of the Christ''. In the episodes prior to "The Passion of the Jew", [[Eric Cartman]] continues to make assorted disparaging remarks towards [[Kyle Broflovski]] about being Jewish, while citing the ''The Passion of the Christ'' as justification. Finally fed up, Kyle goes to see the film, and is horrified by how bloody and vicious [[Jesus Christ]]'s death was. Completely shaken in his Jewish beliefs, Kyle concedes that Cartman is right in his opinions. Seeing this as a sign, Cartman goes on to believe that the film was Mel Gibson's way of rallying people against the Jews, and idolizes him for it. As such, Cartman recreates the Nazi party, under the guise of the "Mel Gibson Fan Club".

[[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kenny McCormick]], on the other hand, after watching the film, are disgusted, seeing it not as a film masterpiece as so many have claimed, but rather a "snuff film" that completely sucked. They demand their money back, but the ticket guy snidely tells them that the only person who can give it to them is the film's producer, Mel Gibson himself. Infuriated by the movie and the ticket guy's attitude, Stan and Kenny go to Gibson's house in Malibu, only to discover that he is a religious zealot and is obsessed with prompting strangers to torture him. Stan and Kenny introduce themselves to Gibson and explain they did not like the movie and they wanted a refund. He then replies by saying that they cannot not like ''The Passion'' and that he just followed the Bible. Stan and Kenny still follow him into his house and insist that he gives them their money. He then replies by stripping himself to his underwear and locking himself up on a table and tells them they can torture him all they want, but that he still would not give them their ticket money. After Stan called him daffy, he threatens them with a pistol, running around acting like the old Daffy Duck cartoons, all the while demanding that they torture him. While running for their lives, Stan and Kenny find and steal the 18 dollars from his wallet and escape. Gibson only had a twenty dollar bill, so Stan and Kenny put two dollars back in the wallet. Gibson, however, chases them back to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in a truck still stripped in his underwear, where he begins to demand the whole town to torture him, all while Cartman praises him, asking for approval. Gibson pays no mind to Cartman or his group, instead becoming angered when nobody tortured him and says "if nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my 18 dollars," but is angered once more when Stan told him that it was their 18 dollars and once again told him his movie sucked. He angrily tells Stan and Kenny that saying his movie sucked is like saying Christianity sucks. Stan counters this argument by saying that Christianity is fine, but focusing on how Jesus Christ died ends up with really bad results, convincing the town that Mel Gibson was wrong all along. Cartman seems somewhat disillusioned in Gibson, after Gibson gleefully defecates on his face.

In "[[Imaginationland]]", the United States government requests the help of Hollywood directors in coming up with ideas on how to fight the terrorists of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]]. Unfortunately, their first two attempts with [[Michael Bay]] and [[M. Night Shyamalan]] prove to be unsuccessful as neither understands plot, but rather special effects and movie 'twists'. Gibson, however, despite still being completely insane, proves to have a good understanding of plot, as he suggests that the government look at video footage from Imaginationland, and see if there is someone who does not belong there.

Gibson appears again, still in his underwear, in a cameo role in "[[200]]", in which [[Tom Cruise]] organized 200 celebrities, in filing a class-action lawsuit against the town of South Park for years of mockery and abuse. It is revealed however that the celebrities actually only want South Park to give them the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]], so they can steal his power of not being ridiculed. He does not speak however.

==Appearance==
Mel Gibson can usually be seen with a painted face wearing nothing but a pair of white briefs underwear. Before stripping, he wears a dark blue collared shirt.

==Personality==
Gibson is portrayed as being utterly insane and disturbed, lacking in any reason and reacting violently to even the slightest criticism of his antics. He is shown to be an intense Sadomasochist, with a particular preference for his nipples being squeezed.
