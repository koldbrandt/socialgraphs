'''PRIMUS''' is an American alternative metal band from [[San Francisco]] that composed and performed the [[South Park Theme|''South Park'' theme]]. The frontman of the group, [[Les Claypool]], sings the lyrics. Les Claypool is somewhat a South Park character as well, with a few appearances on the show. He appears in the opening, singing the theme song in most of the episodes of the show from seasons one through four ("[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" to "[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]")

They made an appearance in the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Chef Aid]]", playing at the concert to support [[Chef]] and said that in the early days of PRIMUS, chef told them to keep trying and keep pursuing their dreams, no matter how much they sucked. Which is a reference to a PRIMUS slogan known as "PRIMUS Sucks!"

PRIMUS performed "South Park Theme" and "[[Mephesto and Kevin]]" on ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''.

PRIMUS' song "[[John the Fisherman]]" was played in the episode, "[[Guitar Queer-O]]". While studying the nature of existence, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] has a psychedelic experience while the song "[[Welcome to This World]]" is played in "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]".

Les Claypool appeared in ''[[Chef Aid: Behind the Menu]]'', in which he talked about [[Chef]]'s influence on his career.
