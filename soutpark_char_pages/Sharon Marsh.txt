'''Sharon Marsh''' (née Kimble) is [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Shelly Marsh]]'s mother, as well as [[Randy Marsh]]'s wife. She first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]".

==Background==
In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', it is revealed that Sharon is the receptionist at [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]].

Sharon was portrayed in earlier seasons as a loving but stern suburban mother. She wanted to protect Stan from the 'dirty' language and vulgar humor of his favorite cartoon, ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'', in "[[Death]]" and ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. In "[[Spookyfish]]", she was so protective that she buried the bodies of people she thought Stan had killed, in order to prevent Stan from being charged with murder. In actuality, it was his new pet [[Spookyfish (Character)|goldfish]] that murdered the people, to which Sharon felt regretful for not realizing in the first place. She was also unofficially in charge of the movement against [[Chinpokomon Dolls|Chinpokomon dolls]] in "[[Chinpokomon]]". However, she has often been caught up in fads around town, such as holistic medicine in "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]" and atheism in "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]".

During the episodes in which she was voiced by [[April Stewart]], Sharon had become the same half of her marriage. She serves as a foil to the craziness that surrounds her; craziness often caused by her husband, Randy. In "[[The Losing Edge]]", she was embarrassed by Randy getting drunk and starting fights at Stan's little league games. This was apparently lost on Randy, who imagined her cheering him on in his big fight against the Bat Dad. In "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]", she is noticeably upset and disappointed in the car ride home after Randy says the N-word on ''Wheel Of Fortune''. In the [[Pandemic]] [[Pandemic 2: The Startling|story arc]], she gets repeatedly angry at Randy for videotaping the guinea pig attacks.

Sharon is named after [[Trey Parker]]'s mother, Sharon Parker. Sharon was referred to her as "Carol" in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Death]]", however, many characters had different names when they were first introduced. Sharon Parker, unlike Mrs. Marsh, is an insurance broker while Mrs. Parker is an insurance saleswoman.

In the episode "[[You're Getting Old]]", she reveals she has been unhappy with her marriage and can't fake it anymore, claiming her life feels like the same ridiculous shit every week, and as a result divorces her husband and moves with her son and daughter to a new home while Randy moves away from himself.

==Criminal Record==
*'''Corpse Concealment:''' In "[[Spookyfish]]" she hides all the people (including [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and her [[Flo Kimble|aunt Flo]]) killed by Stan's fish in her garden so as not to have [[Stan Marsh|her son]]<nowiki/> taken to jail (believing it was him).
*'''False Imprisonment:''' In "[[Spookyfish]]" she holds [[Officer Barbrady]] captive in her basement after he learns about the dead bodies.
*'''Arson:''' In "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", she burns down a Wall-Mart, and Jim's Drugs.

==Appearance==
Sharon's outfit slightly resembles that of Stan's, except with a few slight variations. She wears a brown sweater with red frilly ruffles on the cuffs and the collar, and dark blue jeans. Her hair is brown and seems to be slightly wavy.[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus.png|thumb|left|Sharon in her formal brown dress]]

[[File:Sharon-nightgown.jpg|right|thumb|Sharon in her nightgown.]]
Some characters find her attractive, especially for her cleavage. This is first made evident in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]". Butters, asked by the boys to provide a semen sample for a case, is unable to produce one throughout the episode. At the end of the episode, he was finally able to produce one after he imagined Sharon's breasts. Later, in "[[Pre-School]]", [[The 6th Graders]] agree to protect the boys from [[Trent Boyett]] in exchange for a photo of Sharon's breasts, telling Stan, "Your mom has the hottest boobs!" Because of the way women in ''South Park'' were traditionally animated at the series' start, Sharon's breasts or cleavage cannot be seen by the audience unless she is in nothing but a brassiere or a swimsuit.

At night, she wears a creamy-white, knee-length nightgown with pink lining at the hem and neck, and two orange-yellow flowers embroidered on the chest.

For special occasions, she wears a brown dress with red trimming on top or a black dress, a pearl necklace, and gold earrings.

It is heavily implied in many scenes in the Marsh family's living room that Sharon is farsighted, as whenever she is reading or doing finances, she is seen wearing reading glasses.

In "[[Whale Whores]]", Sharon can be seen wearing a blue bathing suit at the Denver Aquarium. It is unknown if the suit is a one or two-piece suit, as it is hidden by a life vest.

In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", when Randy leaves to be in a boy band, he says bye to a girl, presumably his girlfriend, who looks incredibly like a younger Sharon with longer hair.

[[Future Stan]], in the episode "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", mentions that Sharon has a scar on her left knee, which is leftover from a time when she slipped in a swimming pool.

According to [[Joe and Teresa Giudice|Teresa]] in "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", she has a large chin, however, Teresa is heavily implied to be exaggerating her claim.

In "[[Ass Burgers]]", Sharon wears a pink gown in the morning when making Stan his breakfast.

==Family==
===Randy Marsh===
{{main|Randy Marsh}}
Sharon's husband is Randy Marsh, who she seemed to be inseparable from for the first season and half of the second season. In the [[Season Two]] episode, "[[Clubhouses]]", they divorced because they were constantly arguing. Sharon briefly dated [[Roy]], whom Stan could never get on good terms with, due to Roy's pettish reaction to whatever he said towards him. Towards the end of the episode, Randy and Sharon played 'Truth or Dare' and, touched by the sentiments surrounding the game and their history together, fell in love again and remarried.

However, there have been a few strains in the marriage. Sharon was annoyed with Randy and even yelled at him in "[[Pandemic]]" for recording everything the family did, saying at the start to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], "(Because) ever since your father got that stupid video camera, he thinks he has to record everything the family does." As she was reprimanding him for recording everything the family does, the [[Furry Death]] began. After a scare, the family evidently survived, and they went on to survive the entire crisis.

Sharon is shown to have a fetish in "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", when Randy intentionally gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles swell up to a massive size. Randy mentions that women just love big balls.

Randy's obsession with cooking in "[[Crème Fraiche]]" was distracting him from paying attention to Sharon and their marriage was on the brink of failure, so Sharon took up an interest in the [[Shake Weight]]. After growing annoyed by how clingy it was, she eventually abandoned it. To fix their marriage, and make Randy pay attention to her again, Sharon used what she learned from the shake weight to give Randy an "old fashioned" (a handjob), strengthening their relationship.

They divorce once more in "[[You're Getting Old]]" and it seemed to be permanent, however, they did manage to resolve their differences in the [[Ass Burgers|following episode]], and remarried. Randy and Sharon haven't had a major falling out since then, implying that their relationship has improved.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]", Sharon helps Randy with his obsession with renovating houses and starts a show with him. Sharon did the decorating while Randy did the construction. She didn't seem at all interested, and may have only done the show with Randy to support him, which would be implying that their relationship is getting even better.

===Shelly Marsh===
{{main|Shelly Marsh}}
Sharon's daughter is Shelly Marsh, who has adopted her mother's hair color. Sharon and Randy are unconcerned and oblivious to the fact Shelly physically abuses to Stan, to the point of destroying a part of their house. They sometimes seem to believe that Stan is making up stories about their daughter's rage issues, until she eventually sees her beating him in "[[Over Logging]]" relentlessly. Shelly accused her of favoring Stan in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]".

===Stan Marsh===
{{main|Stan Marsh}}
Her son is Stanley Marsh. She seems to be closer to him than her daughter, although she does get angry with him at irrational moments, while also remaining pleased with him at times when she should be angry. In "[[Spookyfish]]" she tried to protect him by burying the dead bodies of the Spookyfish's victims because she thought Stan killed them. She told him in the episode "[[Clubhouses]]", that she considers his happiness and Shelly's happiness secondary to her own, however, this may have been just a throwaway joke as Sharon's actions as a mother contradict this. In "[[Pandemic]]", she was very worried about Stan when he was arrested by the military as a part of a Peruvian flute band. In "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]", Sharon reads Stan a bedtime story.

===Aunt Flo===
{{main|Flo Kimble}}
Aunt Flo was Sharon's aunt, who would come to visit the Marsh residence once a month and stay for nearly a week at a time. In the episode "[[Spookyfish]]", Aunt Flo gave her great-nephew, Stan a goldfish for Halloween, but it was evil, and killed many people, including Aunt Flo. This upset Sharon, because Aunt Flo would not come and visit her anymore. Before her death, Aunt Flo caught Sharon walking into the house, covered in blood, and carrying a shovel after burying the first murdered victim of the fish. Flo comments that it reminds her of a time when Sharon was twelve years old and in which she saw Sharon doing the exact same thing, implying that Sharon may have been involved with another murder at the time.

Aunt Flo is an obvious reference to the menstrual cycle, and her death parodies the menopause.

===[[Roy]]===
{{main|Roy}}
Roy was Sharon's new boyfriend after she divorced Randy in "[[Clubhouses]]". She stayed with him until she and Randy played 'Truth or Dare' in Stan's clubhouse, in which Sharon dared Randy to have sex with her, causing them to make up and for Sharon to break up with Roy. He seemed to have what could best be described as bipolar disorder. One moment trying to be nice and caring towards Stan, then after simply shrugging it off Roy became angry and irrational. He consistently told Stan to chop firewood after these incidences, so much that Stan stated they had enough for a whole year.

===[[Jimbo Kern]]===
{{main|Jimbo Kern}}
Jimbo is Sharon's brother. She takes care of him when he's stricken with COVID-19 in "[[The Pandemic Special]]".

==Trivia==
*Sharon Marsh is [[April Stewart]]'s favorite role.
*Sharon is the only member of the Marsh family to not be seen wearing clothing from [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] since Randy's acquisition of the farm.
*[[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and the [[6th Grader Leader|6th Graders]] are sexually attracted to Sharon's breasts.
*Her maiden name is Kimble, as mentioned in the episode "[[My Future Self n' Me]]." However, Jimbo Kern was confirmed to be her brother in "[[The Pandemic Special]]". Sharon's maiden name is most likely a continuity error. 
*Sharon has not used the word "fuck" for the entire series until "[[Dead Kids]]".
*Both Sharon Marsh and [[Mrs. Tenorman]] are known for having the most attractive breasts in South Park.
