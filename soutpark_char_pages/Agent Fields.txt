'''Agent Fields''' is an FBI agent who appears in "[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]" and "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".

==Background==
In "[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]", he is one of two CIA agents in search of an alien ship piloted by [[Starvin' Marvin (Character)|Starvin' Marvin]].

In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", he and his men inexplicably show up to the shootout underway at [[the Peppermint Hippo]] in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", where he attempts to pull jurisdiction on [[Lieutenant Dawson]]. His relationship with Dawson mirrors that of [[Agent Tucker]]'s relationship with the [[South Park Crime Unit]].

==Appearance==
He wears the standard FBI uniform which consists of a black suit, a white undershirt with a black tie, and black pants.

==Personality==
He seems to be controlling, completely overtaking [[Lieutenant Dawson]]'s case in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", not letting Dawson help or assist him in any way.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", it should have been the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and not the FBI, who showed up, as [[Gino]] was a drug dealer.
