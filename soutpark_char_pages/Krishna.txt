'''Krishna''' is a [[wikipedia:Hinduism|Hindu]] deity who is a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]. His powers include shapeshifting and flight. He saved [[South Park]] from [[Barbra Streisand]] by pacifying her in in "[[201]]".

==Appearance==
Krishna's most notable features are his light blue skin and "halo" around his head. Krishna wears a bejeweled crown on his head with what appears to be a variously shaded pink feather sticking out of the top of it. Krishna also wears a dark purple necklace, light purple strips of fabric on his wrists, a yellow and brown bracelet on his right wrist, loose fitting yellow dhoti with brown and blue decorations at their top, and a light orange sash.

==Personality==
He is a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]], so we can assume that he is heroic and cares about the safety of innocents.
