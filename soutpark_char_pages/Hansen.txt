'''Hansen''' is a SWAT member who appears in [[Season Four]] episode "[[Fourth Grade]]".

==Background==
In an attempt to travel back to third grade, [[The Boys|the boys]] seek help from the [[Star Trek Nerds]] to build a time travelling device onto [[Timmy Burch]]'s wheelchair, but the plan backfired when the device went out of control, causing Timmy's wheelchair to speed up. Knowing that the device would explode if the wheelchair slows down, a SWAT helicopter was deployed with Hansen attempting to disable the device, only to have accidentally carried a woman on board. Despite the difficulties, Hansen managed to fix the device at the last few seconds, creating a time portal as designed, but sending Timmy back to pre-history. 

==Appearance==
Hansen appears to have brown hair, and wears the SWAT uniform with black headgear and harness.
