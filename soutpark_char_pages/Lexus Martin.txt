'''Lexus Martin''' is a waitress in the Hooters-inspired restaurant [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]]. She made her first appearance in the episode "[[Raisins]]" as [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' choice in girlfriend. She did not return his affection, however, as being nice to boys is her job. She made an appearance in "[[You Got F'd in the A]]", where she was seen dancing in the background.

==Background==
Lexus was seen flirting with multiple boys at a time, as is typical for a [[Raisins Girls|Raisins girl]]. She talked to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] on the phone, as well as winking at a couple of boys walking by. With her charm, Lexus had made Butters fall madly in love with her, and thus she got many tips and presents. He believed that he and Lexus were in a serious relationship, only for Lexus to dump him saying she only used him for extra tips and gifts, which left Butters heartbroken and saddened.

==Appearance==
Lexus looks like all Raisins waitresses, dressed in a skimpy cheerleader-type t-shirt with the Raisins logo, orange shorts and white shoes. She has long, ginger-orange hair, wears purple eye shadow, blush, mascara, and red lipstick.

==Personality==
Lexus seems to be straightforward and unaffected by other people's emotions. She seems to be the biggest flirt out of all the Raisins, leaving her to have a more "gold digger" type personality than the others. She is shown to be rather intelligent, knowing how to get Butters to give her money easily. This could just be, though, because Butters gets attracted easily and that he is so naive.

==Prominence==
*"[[Raisins]]" - Her first appearance, shown manipulating Butters.
*"[[You Got F'd in the A]]" - Shown briefly, dancing with another Raisins girl.
*"[[201]]" - Seen running from [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]] after the destruction of [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]].
*"[[Butterballs]]" - Seen in [[Stan Marsh|Stan's]] anti-bullying video.
*"[[Franchise Prequel]]" - (pictured) - Appears on Butters' [[Facebook]] profile on his computer as one of his Facebook friends.
