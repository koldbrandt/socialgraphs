'''Matthew McConaughey''' is an actor who appears in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, "[[Handicar]]", where he drives and simultaneously advertizes the Handicar and ZipCar vehicles, satirizing his actual commercials for Lincoln's MK series of vehicles.

==Background==
Matthew McConaughey first appears driving a Handicar, saying that he "was driving a Handicar way before [he] got paid to drive one" and that he "just likes how it feels". However, later when he's competing in ''Wacky Races'', McConaughey appears driving a Zipcar, saying, just like with the Handicar, that he "was driving a ZipCar way before [he] got paid to drive one". At the end of the race, McConaughey tries to catch up to [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s Handicar, which is in the lead; however, explosives that were set by [[Mimsy]], which were intended for Timmy's Handicar, were actually set under McConaughey's Zipcar. This happens because Mimsy mistook the "fake, soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves" to be McConaughey, rather than Timmy, which angers [[Nathan]]. The explosives go off, ripping open a wormhole that sucks McConaughey in, allowing Timmy to win the race.

==Appearance==
Matthew McConaughey has combed brown hair and wears a black business suit, which includes a black coat, a white shirt, and a black tie.
