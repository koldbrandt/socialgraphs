'''Nanny Skexis''' is an elderly Skeksis seen in the [[Season Ten]] episode "[[Tsst]]".

==Background==
Nanny Skexis was seen during the Nanny 911 parody montage as one of the nannies sent to discipline children who are out of control. [[Liane Cartman]] sees this program as an inspiration to get [[Eric Cartman]] to behave.

A Skeksis is seen again in "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]" as one of the evil characters that broke through the blown up barrier to attack everyone's imagination.

Another Skeksis is seen again in "[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]" in the final battle.

==Appearance==
In "[[Tsst]]", Nanny Skexis wears a red jumper and a gray and black dress with a white wig, pearl earrings, and round glasses. In "[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]", a Skexis is seen wearing normal clothing.

==Trivia==
*Nanny Skexis is a reference to the fantasy film ''[[wikipedia:The Dark Crystal|The Dark Crystal]]'' in which the Skeksis are the main villains of the film.
