'''Shauna''' is a [[South Park Elementary]] student who makes her first appearance in the [[Season Nine]] episode "[[Erection Day]]". She also appears briefly as a background character in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode "[[Board Girls]]".

==Background==
[[Jimmy Valmer]] arranges a date with her in hopes of getting her to have sex with him. After a brief discussion, Jimmy ruins the date by stating, ''"I am so glad you think so Shauna, because I really want to stick my penis in your vagina."'' Shauna responds by throwing her cup of water at him, calling him a creep, and leaving the restaurant in disgust.

==Appearance==
Shauna has long, orange hair. She wears a purple blouse with white trimming, two light cyan bows in her hair, a black skirt, and black shoes.

==Personality==
Shauna is shown to enjoy gossiping, although unlike [[Porsche|some girls]], she seems to know when to stop, only continuing on after being urged by [[Jimmy Valmer]]. Shauna's reaction when Jimmy said he wanted to have sex with her is typical of any girl in her age group.
