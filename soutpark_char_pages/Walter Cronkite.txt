'''Walter Cronkite''' was a famous American anchorman of CBS. He appeared in purgatory in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[Dead Celebrities]]".

==Background==
He was first heard talking to a nurse, telling her and the boys that [[Michael Jackson]] wouldn't admit to his death and that was keeping everyone stranded in purgatory. Like everyone else on the plane, he thought sitting on a plane doing nothing was bad enough without [[Billy Mays]] selling his products. But when the plane went to [[Hell]], he reacted badly, like the other passengers. He now resides in Hell.

==Appearance==
He appeared as an old man, with thick gray eyebrows and a gray mustache. He wears a black suit with a green, black striped tie.

==Personality==
He appears to be irritated by [[Michael Jackson]]'s refusal to accept that he is dead, although this is not abnormal, as the rest of the celebrities were irritated as well.
