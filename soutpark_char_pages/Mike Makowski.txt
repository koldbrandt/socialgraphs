'''Mike "Vampir" Makowski''' is a 5th grader who appears in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, "[[The Ungroundable]]". He is the leader of the [[South Park Vampire Society]] and an avid fan of the ''Twilight'' series.

==Background==
His appearance in "[[The Ungroundable]]" makes him seem like a calm, innocent kid; With him being dark inside, he is adopted to [[Mr. Adams]]. He is a big ''Twilight'' fan with the [[South Park Vampire Society]], with reading books to them. On what he got his alise, Vampir, makes him feel the only special vampire of the group. As leader, he hosts the rituals when other kids want to be in the group. 
Aside from the [[Goth Kids]], the Vampire Society is less frightening, spiritual and more positive with them not having to smoke and being away from coffee. The Goth Kids then suspected he was the reason as to why people used their style and made others confuse them with the Vampire Society, so they gagged him and planned to kill him, thinking everyone will go back to normal. Even though Mike admitted he is not really a Vampire, they still FedEx'ed him to the city of Scottsdale in Arizona.

He later reappears in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode "[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]", along with [[Unnamed Black Vampire|another vampire kid]], to join forces with the Goth Kids, [[Pete Thelman (Goth)|Pete]] and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]], to try to uncover the camp turning Goths and Vampires into 'Emos'. It is still unknown that he befriended the goths after the episode. He cameos again later in the "[[Black Friday]]" trilogy as a member of the PlayStation 4 camp, along with other Vampire Kids.

Mike also appears to frequently remark, "per se" in his speech.
