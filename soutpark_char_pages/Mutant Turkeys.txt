The '''Mutant Turkeys''' were a group of genetically-altered turkeys who appear in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Starvin' Marvin]]".

==Background==
[[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] created genetically-altered turkeys for Thanksgiving, but they escaped from his lab and began rampaging through [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The turkeys destroyed several structures, including [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s classroom, and murdered several [[City People|townsfolk]] at [[Stark's Pond]]. 

Dr. Mephesto attempted to warn [[Mayor McDaniels]], but she dismissed his claims, citing Mephesto for being crazy. The turkeys are later seen rampaging a canned food drive near the South Park Library. 

In an attempt to get the turkeys under control, [[Jerome "Chef" McElroy|Chef]] leads the townsfolk in a battle dressed as William Wallace, from the movie ''Braveheart''. During the debacle, [[Kenny McCormick]] is killed by the turkeys. Eventually the townspeople are able to kill them all. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] soon arrives to escort [[Starvin' Marvin (Character)|Starvin' Marvin]] back to Ethiopia, with turkeys to feed his [[Ethiopian Tribe|tribe]].
