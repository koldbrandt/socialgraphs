}}'''Barack Hussein Obama II''' was the 44th President of the [[United States]] and the first African-American to hold the office from 2009 to 2017. He was succeeded by President [[Herbert Garrison]] following the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

==Background==
==="[[About Last Night...]]"===
He is a member of a professional thief organization. He and [[John McCain]] are both in this organization and both ran for presidency. If either won, they would have gained access to the presidential escape tunnel. This would allow them to execute an intricate plot to steal the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institute. They succeed in their efforts and fake their deaths, with the help of [[Ike Broflovski]]. They then planned to travel to an exotic island to live out the remainder of their lives. Obama, however, decides to actually give the presidency a chance along with [[Michelle Obama]].

==="[[Sexual Healing]]"===
President Obama is one of the lead members in the elaborate conspiracy to justify the actions of rich, successful men, who have been caught cheating on their spouses. He notes that the men were under the control of a [[Wizard Alien]], causing them to be addicted to sex.

When [[Kyle Broflovski]] suggests that they need to learn to control their impulses, he and [[Butters Stotch]] are taken to the alien at Independence Hall. Once there, Barack Obama urges the boys to kill the alien, who in reality was a soldier wearing a costume. After the soldier is killed, Obama gives a speech reassuring others that if a rich, successful man is caught cheating, it would be because of a Wizard Alien.

==="[[Funnybot]]"===
President Obama told the public that [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]] had planned an attack against the United States, using its and Russia's missiles. He stated that he would spend his last few hours on earth watching "Madea" movies with his family. He stated that he was embarrassed, but he could not help it.

==="[[Obama Wins!]]"===
President Obama makes a deal with [[General Tso]] to in order to get re-elected. The deal was that if Obama is re-elected, the Chinese will get the rights to ''[[wikipedia:Star Wars|Star Wars]]''. General Tso makes a deal with [[Eric Cartman]], which was that if Cartman steals the ballots and gives them to General Tso at [[Red Lobster]], then Cartman would get a role in the next ''Star Wars'' film. However, the deal is postponed due to [[Kyle Broflovski]] and others trying to stop Cartman. Cartman hides the ballots at a Hummer dealership. In the end, to protect the ''Star Wars'' franchise, everyone decides to burn the ballots, guaranteeing Obama a second term in office.

==Personality==
Embodying a 'gentleman thief' archetype, Obama is depicted with natural charm as well as good manners and courteousness, using distraction and manipulation rather than violence or intimidation to achieve criminal ends. He is outgoing and confident in interactions with his staff and close allies. He is willing to resort to complex manipulation, inventing the '[[Wizard Alien]]' as an excuse for the various rich men having sex with many women, and he has ballots stolen to preserve his re-election as President.
