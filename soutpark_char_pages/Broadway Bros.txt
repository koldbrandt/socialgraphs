}}The '''Broadway Bros''' - Stephen Sondheim, Stephen Schwarz, Andrew Lloyd Webber and [[Elton John]] - are a group of Broadway writers who are total bros and hang out at [[Hooters]]. They are responsible for creating a massive conspiracy to get men blowjobs through subliminal messaging in Broadway theater productions.

They all appear in the episode "[[Broadway Bro Down]]". When they learn about [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s new play, ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen'', they are alarmed that the overtness of the play will disclose the secret of Broadway and set out to stop him.

Although their first meeting is confrontational, Randy and Sondheim later have a "bro-down" and gain respect for one another. Now officially "bros", the other writers eagerly help Randy make his play more subtle, renaming it to ''[[The Woman in White]]'' and removing all the outright mentions of blowjobs, instead of introducing more oral "subtext". It is not known whether the play was completed, as Randy left to interrupt a performance of ''Wicked'' in order to stop [[Shelly Marsh|his daughter]] from performing oral sex on [[Larry Feegan|her boyfriend]] before it was completed.

==Stephen Sondheim==

'''Stephen Sondheim''' has written a large number of critically acclaimed theater productions, including (but not limited to) ''West Side Story'', ''Sweeney Todd'', ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Merrily We Roll Along''. Sondheim was described as "the greatest Broadway composer alive today, perhaps the greatest of all time" during the episode. He has a "bro-down" with [[Randy Marsh]], after which they become bros. He later helps Randy introduce some subtext into his play, ''The Woman in White''. He wears a black, yellow, and white Pittsburgh Steelers jersey as well as a Steelers' hat of the same colors.
