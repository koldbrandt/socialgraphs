'''Polly Prissypants''' was one of [[Eric Cartman]]'s toys, along with [[Clyde Frog]], [[Peter Panda]], [[Rumpertumskin]], and [[Muscleman Marc]]. They were the only comfort Cartman had and acted as his [[Multiple Personality Disorder|alter-egos]]. He talks to them by pretending they are real when he is having personal issues in his life. Polly, along with the rest of his toys were "killed" in "[[1%]]" by individual executions.

==Appearance==
Polly Prissypants is a small stuffed doll attired in a sleeved pink dress with white trimmings and two unsewn pink buttons, a large pink hat with white frills, white and pink striped stockings, and brown slippers. She has short brown hair, light blue buttons stitched with black thread as eyes, large rosy cheeks, and pink lipstick.
