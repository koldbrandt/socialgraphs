'''Clyde Frog''' was one of [[Eric Cartman]]'s stuffed toys along with [[Rumpertumskin]], [[Polly Prissypants]], [[Peter Panda]], and [[Muscleman Marc]]. It was known as Eric's most favorite toy, as evidenced in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", where he says a tearful farewell to Clyde Frog before he goes on a dangerous mission. 

In some episodes, when Eric was alone, he would ask Clyde Frog for advice, and he seems to have seen the stuffed animal as a friend as seen in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]". 

==Background==
[[File:1201 killing clyde frog.jpg|Clyde Frog on South Park Studios.|thumb|left]]
Clyde Frog first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]". He was one of the stuffed animals at a tea party in Cartman's backyard. When Clyde Frog was asked by Eric what he thought about him, his reply was "I think you're a big fat piece of crap". In the episode "[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]" he is seen in Mayor Cartman's office, and in the episode "[[The Jeffersons]]", in the toy grab machine at [[Michael Jackson|Mr. Jefferson's]] house you can see Clyde frog inside it in many scenes. Clyde Frog was torn apart in "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", when an enraged [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] ripped Clyde's head off as payback when finding out that Cartman had infected him with [[AIDS|HIV]], but Clyde Frog makes an appearance in-tact in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode "[[Dances with Smurfs]]". In [[South Park: The Complete Fourteenth Season|Season Fourteen DVD]], Clyde Frog was in a deleted scene for "[[201]]". He is also seen in the basement in "[[The Last of the Meheecans]]".

He ends up dying in the episode "[[1%]]". 

In ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', Clyde Frog is the trophy given to the player if they get a silver medal.

===Death===
Clyde Frog "died" in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode "[[1%]]". He was murdered at the hands of Cartman, who pretended it was [[Polly Prissypants]], after he was told to grow up and "killed" all of his stuffed dolls in a very dramatic way. He was the first out of Cartman's toys to "die".

==Trivia==
*Clyde Frog is based on a character of the same name from a children's educational program from the late 1970s called ''[[Wikipedia:Clyde_Frog_Show|The Clyde Frog Show]]''.
*Clyde Frog's design vaguely resmbles [[w:c:muppet:Kermit the Frog|Kermit the Frog]] from ''The Muppets''.
*Cartman referred to him as "Artemus Clyde Frog" while playing ''Wild Wild West'' in the season 3 episode [[Cat Orgy]]. As this was the first time Clyde Frog had been directly referenced, many viewers came to believe this was the toy's name. However, Cartman was merely referencing the character "Artemus Gordon" from the movie - he also referred to [[Polly Prissypants]] as "Salma Hayek" (who acted in the film) and to himself as "James West, cowboy and rap star" (Will Smith's character).
