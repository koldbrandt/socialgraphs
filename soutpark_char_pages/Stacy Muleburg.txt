'''Stacy Muleburg''' is the poster child for "Halitosis Kidz!", an organization attempting to counteract bad breath. She appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[Cartman Finds Love]]".

==Background==
In "[[Cartman Finds Love]]", she was seen at the basketball game promoting Halitosis Kidz. After [[Token Black]] and [[Nichole Daniels]] resume their relationship, Stacy fell in love with [[Eric Cartman]] as she was shot with "love" arrows from Cartman's alter-ego, [[Cupid Me]].

==Appearance==
Stacy is overweight, similar to Cartman, and she wears black shoes, navy blue pants, and a blue "Halitosis Kidz!" shirt over a white undershirt.  She has long brown hair with a pink bow to hold her ponytail. She has a snout-like nose and severely rotten teeth, which are likely the cause of her halitosis.
