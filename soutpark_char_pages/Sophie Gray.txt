'''Sophie Gray''' is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]], who appears in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, "[[Basic Cable]]". She is the new girl at school, who recently moved from Scottsdale, Arizona to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She has diabetes.

==Background==
During her self introduction in class, she mentions that she has diabetes, which makes [[Scott Malkinson]] develop a crush on her. She is fawned over by many of the boys in the school soon after she introduces herself. However, Scott does his best to chase them away. When he gets to hang out with her during recess but unlike him, Sophie was not interested in talking about diabetes and was unaware of his feelings towards her and he fails to connect with her until she brings up ''[[The Mandalorian]]''. Scott lies and says he watches it, and the two arrange to watch it at [[Malkinson Residence|his house]].

Since his father was against streaming services, Scott goes to meet [[Nathan]], who is selling streaming accounts and passwords. He asks for Disney+ and trades it for some of his insulin. Scott gets his house decorated just as Sophie arrives. The two sit down to watch ''The Mandalorian'' but Disney+ goes down just as he starts it, thanks to Clark and the other cable workers taking the cables out. The two head to [[Valmer Residence|Jimmy's house]] but find Disney+ down there as well. The boys all try to comfort Sophie, angering Scott.

Sophie arrives home to find her Disney+ not working. The boys introduce themselves to Sophie's [[Mrs. Gray|mom]] while Scott goes to get some sugar for a sugar rush. He then yells at the boys for trying to steal his girlfriend, only for Sophie to tell him she is not his girlfriend. She then berates everyone for hitting on her when she only just moved here. Scott tries to explain they were meant together since they both have diabetes. Sophie explains she is more than her diabetes, but Scott realizes he is not.

Scott sits alone in [[South Park Elementary Playground|the playground]] and Sophie comes to comfort him. She tells him she is glad there is someone she can talk about diabetes with, and that she likes the ''Scott Malkinson Show''. 

==Personality==
Sophie is shown to be calm, empathetic, and friendly with people around her.

==Appearance==
Sophie has long orange hair tied into a side-swept braid with a thin strand on the side that she usually pushes out the way of her face and long bangs held back by a blue hairclip. She wears a pale pink shirt under a dark blue sweater, a violet-red skirt, and gray leggings. She also wears white socks and black sandals.

==Interactions==
===[[The Boys]]===
Many of the 4th-grade boys at school became attracted to Sophie and try to flirt and hang out with her in "[[Basic Cable]]".

===[[Scott Malkinson]]===
Scott developed an interest in Sophie when she revealed she had diabetes just like him and believed that their illness made them the perfect match although she was not interested in talking about diabetes and was unaware of his feelings towards her and believed he just wanted them to be friends. The two are currently friends for now.
