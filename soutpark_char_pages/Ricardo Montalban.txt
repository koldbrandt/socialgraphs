==Personality==
The Ricardo in "[[Cancelled]]" and the Ricardo in "[[Imaginationland]]" were likely two different people, the one in "[[Cancelled]]" being one of [[Najix]]'s forms, and the one in "[[Imaginationland]]" being one of Ricardo's characters, Khan from ''Star Trek''. They will be listed under separate headers to prevent any confusion.
==="[[Cancelled]]"===
The Ricardo shown here was one of [[Najix|the alien]] forms.
==="[[Imaginationland]]"===
He was one of the evil characters of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]], so, we can assume that he, along with the rest of the evil imaginary characters wanted to take over Imaginationland.

==Prominence==
*"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]" - Mentioned/Referenced; a reporter resembling him discusses the Observatory.
*"[[Cancelled]]" - He is one of the forms suggested by [[Najix]] to the boys.
*"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]" - His character, Khan Noonien-Singh, can be seen as one of the evil characters.
*"[[Dead Celebrities]]" - appears as one of the deceased celebrities waiting for entrance to Heaven
