'''Veronica''' is [[Chef]]'s former girlfriend/fiancé, who was revealed to be a [[wikipedia:Succubus|succubus]] (a demon that appears in dreams and takes the form of a woman to seduce men) in the episode "[[The Succubus]]".

==Appearance==
Veronica has two specific forms. Her human form is that of a moderately attractive black-haired woman, who is slightly taller and thinner than Chef. She haves long black hair, arched eyebrows, and pink lipstick. She is often seen wearing a thin dark-green dress held at the waist and black shoes. She is later depicted in a short, frilly wedding dress, a white flower crown with a veil, a light-blue lace, white shoes, and holds a colorful bouquet.

Veronica's true demon form however is that of a demented, massive beast of a woman; with low-hanging breasts, cloven-hoofed feet, blood-red eyes, protruding fangs, and large red leathery wings. She does not appear to wear any clothing in this form, however, she has an exaggeratedly large tuft of pubic hair which acts as a loincloth.

==Relationships==
===Chef===
Chef first met Veronica while searching for Kama Sutra books at the library. Using her hypnotic song, "[[The Morning After]]", she tricked Chef into spending the night, talking to him about "the goddess" and the evils of men, and forcing him to fall in love with her. [[Mr. Derp]] tells [[The Boys|The boys]] that Chef quitted being the school chef and became an accountant to get a change about meaningless sex. The boys, however, grew suspicious of Veronica's behavior, primarily out of jealousy of losing Chef to her and to get married. However, after talking to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], the boys realized that she was in truth a demonic Succubus, a demon sent from Hell to suck the life out of men. The boys soon discovered that Garrison was right, though Garrison was not speaking in the literal sense when she revealed her demonic form. The boys attempted to warn Chef, who did not believe them, and cast them out.

After doing research, the boys soon discovered that to defeat Veronica, they would need to force her to listen to her own song backward. They did so at her wedding, causing her to reveal her true form to not only Chef but to his parents and the rest of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. After she managed to kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] sang the rest of the song to cast Veronica to the pits of Hell from whence she came and to never come back.
