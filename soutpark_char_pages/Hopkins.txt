'''Hopkins''' was a detective with the [[Park County Police Force]], who appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".

==Background==
He is often seen with his cohorts [[Murphy and Jenkins]]. Unlike them, however, he was not corrupt and was not antagonistic towards [[the boys]] in "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]".

He insisted the other two be nice to them. During the raid on the Peppermint Hippo, Hopkins was sent in along with Murphy and Jenkins by [[Lieutenant Dawson]]. When Murphy and Jenkins revealed their true colors, Hopkins protected the boys by returning fire at them and was wounded by Murphy. He was later taken to the hospital.

==Appearance==
Hopkins has brown hair with a noticeable widow's peak and an elongated nose. He wears a hunter green "business" shirt, light green suspenders, a black tie, and dark gray pants.

==Personality==
He seems kind and incorruptible, unlike Murphy and Jenkins. In "[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]", he defended the boys on numerous occasions and told Jenkins and Murphy to leave them alone when they bully them.

==''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''==
Detective Hopkins is one of several police officers that are fought during [[The Thin White Line]] mission.

==Trivia==
*In the Mandarin Chinese dub, Hopkins is named "晨泳人" (Pinyin: ''Chén yǒng rén''). This name, along with those of Murphy and Jenkins, parody the main characters of the ''[[Wikipedia:Infernal Affairs (film series)|Infernal Affairs]]'' film series.
