{{LinkDisambig|Rick (Disambiguation)}}
'''Rick'''<ref>"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]"</ref> is formerly the ticket salesman for [[Bijou Cinema]] and currently the local [[Burger King]] store manager.

==Background==
Rick first appeared in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' when [[the Boys|the boys]] try to get into the cinema to watch ''[[Asses of Fire]]''. The operator tells them they need an adult with them, so they pay a homeless guy to let them in.

Rick's most prominent appearance is in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]". In this episode, he lets [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] watch ''The Passion of the Christ'' as he believes it is an important film that everyone should watch. He later joins [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s rally to kill all the Jews (believing, along with the others that it is a rally to celebrate the movie). He, along with the others, lose their faith in [[Mel Gibson]] after seeing what a lunatic he really is.

In "[[Handicar]]", a different ticket operator is seen, suggesting that the original ticket operator left or was fired. In "[[Let Them Eat Goo]]", he is seen working at Burger King.

==Appearance==
Rick wears the standard ticket operator uniform, which consists of a white jacket under a red vest. He also wears a thin black tie, dark blue pants, and black shoes. He has black hair that forms a widow's peak and is usually seen inside the ticket booth. Rick seems to be underweight.

==Personality==
Rick seems very dedicated to his job, not letting the boys watch an R rated movie in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. His attitude changes in "[[The Passion of the Jew]]" when he lets Kyle watch ''The Passion'' even though he's underage.

==Prominence==
*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Denies the boys entry until they pay a homeless man to pretend to be their guardian.
*"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" - Denies Cartman's pubes as payment for tickets.
*"[[Cartmanland]]" - Tells everyone that they can't come in when the cinema uses the "You Can't Come" technique.
*"[[Free Hat]]" - Denies the kids their money back.
*"[[The Passion of the Jew]]" - Joins Cartman's rally.
*"[[AWESOM-O]]" - Seen looking at Butters and Cartman (as [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]]).
*"[[Dances with Smurfs]]" - Seen at the cinema when Cartman leaves.
*"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]" - Works at Burger King and gets irritated by [[Randy Marsh]] selling his own plant-based burgers.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Rick is seen when [[Douchebag|the New Kid]] goes to Bijou Cinema. He tells the kid he can't see ''Asses of Fire 2'' as he is underage. He later becomes a zombie but is not fought.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Whenever the New Kid fights [[Chaos Kids|Chaos Minions]] outside the theatre, Rick will stay in his booth and make fun of the new kid's costumes and special effects.

==Trivia==
*[[Matt Stone]] has stated that he feels that the booth operator is the same as the Squirt Scout Master seen in [[Jewbilee]] as they have a similar design and have the same voice. This Scout Master was named [[Schlomo]]. However, it was confirmed in "[[Let Them Eat Goo]]" that the Ticket Guy is called "Rick" so they are not the same person.
