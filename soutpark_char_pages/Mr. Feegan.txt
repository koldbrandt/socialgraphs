'''Mr. Feegan''', [[Larry Feegan]]'s father, is a militant vegan. He appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, "[[Broadway Bro Down]]".

==Background==
[[Stan Marsh]] and his sister [[Shelly]] stay the weekend at the [[Feegan Residence|Feegan's home]] while [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] takes [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] to see Broadway musicals in [[New York City]].

During dinner, Mr. Feegan preaches about veganism, claiming that a vegan diet and a life vest can prevent cancer, heart disease, and drowning. Shelly gets into a confrontation with Mr. Feegan when she suggests letting Larry decide for himself if he wants to be a vegan. Larry is obviously afraid of his parents, not daring to speak up to them, and waves at Shelly to keep going. She suggests that having a nice steak once in a while might prevent Larry from being bullied at school. This makes Mr. Feegan very angry and he argues with her. In turn, Larry sees this as an act of bravery and begins trying to win the acceptance of Shelly.

==Personality==
He is a bully who is fanatical about veganism. He is over-protective of his son, forcing him to be a vegan and to wear a life vest at all times.

==Appearance==
Mr. Feegan has longish brown hair, thick brown eyebrows, visible ears, and a visible nose. He appears tanned and muscular. He wears a navy blue polo tee and navy blue track pants, both of which have white stripes on either side. He wears navy blue slider flip flops with white stripes. [[Mrs. Feegan|His wife]] wears the same shirt and flip flops as him. Like the rest of his family, he wears an orange life vest around his neck at all times to prevent drowning; indicating that they are probably survivalists.
