The '''French Canadian Mime''' is a mime who appears in [[Season Seven]] episode "[[It's Christmas in Canada]]".

==Background==
As [[The Boys|the boys]] and [[Rick the Mountie]] were on their way to [[Ottawa]] to see the Prime Minister, they ended up in French Canada, and met the mime. The mime tells the group that the Prime Minister had recently passed a law that banned the consumption of wine, and wanted to follow them.

The group managed to overturn the laws when it was discovered that [[Saddam Hussein]] had been in control all along.

==Appearance==
The mime wears a typical mime costume. Unlike most Canadians, the mime has a square-shaped head instead of a round one.

==Personality==
It is noted by Rick the Mountie that the mime, like all other French Canadians, are "a little odd". In the first conversations, the mime would show a hand sign imitating calling the other party through a phone, and expects them to reciprocate.

The mime rarely uses body movements and instead speaks often, which is atypical of a mime artist.
