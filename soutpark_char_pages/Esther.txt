'''Esther''' is one of the popular girls at [[South Park Elementary]]. She has never played a prominent role; however, she does often speak in episodes which heavily concern the [[List of Female 4th Graders|female students]]. She can be seen in the background of many episodes, usually playing with or talking to [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Red]], [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] or [[Millie]].

==Appearance==
She has shoulder-length black hair and wears a sky-blue jacket with pink trimming, and pink pants. She wears pink gloves as well, being a lighter shade than both her pants and her collar. Under her jacket, she has been shown to wear a sky blue blouse, as seen in "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]". 

As a "stupid spoiled whore", she wore a green-and-black military patterned halter top, blue jeans, and black stiletto-heeled boots. She also wore pink blush with blue eyeshadow, similar to [[Red]].

At the sleepover in "[[Marjorine]]", she wore a violet pajama top with a deep purple lace collar and a pair of violet plaid pajama bottoms.
