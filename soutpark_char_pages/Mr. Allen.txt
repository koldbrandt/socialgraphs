'''Mr. Allen''' is [[Bill Allen]]'s father, who first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]".

==Background==
He first appeared in the background watching the [[South Park Elementary]] Christmas play in "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]". He later appeared prominently in "[[Damien]]", where he was at the bar laughing with [[Mr. McDonald]], using their sons' "That's gay!" catch phrase. He shares the same characteristics as his son, with the exception of the turquoise shirt; he wears a purple shirt which resembles that of [[Fosse]]'s.

He is shown to be friends with [[Mr. McDonald]] and was confirmed to be Bill's father in the creator commentary for "[[Damien]]".

==Appearance==
His appearance is similar to his son's, the only difference being his shirt; he wears a purple shirt rather than a turquoise one.

==Personality==
Much like his son, he likes to call things "gay" whilst laughing in a deep voice.
