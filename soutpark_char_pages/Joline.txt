'''Joline''' is the mother of the 4-month old "out of control" child [[Chantal]] who appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, "[[Freak Strike]]".

==Background==
Joline appears on [[Maury Povich]]'s show "My Child's Out of Control" alongside her 4-month old daughter Chantal, whom she claims is out of control because she takes all her clothes off and runs around in front of everyone, which she ends up doing on the show. Joline believes this makes her daughter "a god damn whore".

==Appearance==
Joline has messy blonde hair with brown highlights. She may be one of the more poor characters in the show, as she wears a pink shirt with stains and rips in it as well as blue pants and black shoes. She wears purple makeup on her eyelids and has small red earrings on both ears.
