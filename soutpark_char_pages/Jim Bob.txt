'''Jim Bob''' is an anti-[[Alexa]] protester who appears in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, "[[White People Renovating Houses]]".

==Background==
When he and the other protesters successfully got all digital assistants removed from [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] replaced her and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ''Alexa'' with him. Jim Bob, like [[Darryl Weathers|Darryl]], was hypocritically unhappy with Alexa's job once he had actually taken it, and snapped at Cartman when he tried to play a game of ''Simon Says'' with him, finding his requests to be abhorrent.

==Appearance==
Jim Bob is overweight, so much so that his belly is coming out of his shirt. He has dark gray hair with sideburns and pink cheeks. He was seen wearing a black shirt, gray pants, and black shoes. Jim Bob's mouth is uniquely designed when he is not speaking.

==Personality==
Jim Bob lacks Alexa's subservience, much to Cartman's dismay.
