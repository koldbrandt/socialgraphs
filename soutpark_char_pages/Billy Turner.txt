'''Billy Turner''' is a 3rd grade student at [[South Park Elementary]]. He made his only appearance in the [[Season Nine]] episode, "[[Erection Day]]", and was later mentioned in "[[Tsst]]", as a victim of [[Eric Cartman]]'s torment.

==Background==
In "[[Erection Day]]", the then Mrs. [[Herbert Garrison|Garrison]] introduced Billy at the school's talent show. Billy performed and played "Mary had a Little Lamb" on his saxophone. According to the audience's reactions, Billy played the song poorly.

In "[[Tsst]]", Billy called Eric Cartman "chubby", ridiculing him because of his weight problem. Offended by this, Cartman handcuffed Billy's ankle to a flagpole and gave him a hacksaw. He told him he had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg. Following this incident, Mr. Mackey mentioned that Billy was now being treated at the hospital.

==Appearance==
Billy Turner wears black shoes, blue pants, and a long sleeved, red shirt. He's Caucasian and has messy brown hair. However, in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the Coon mentions that Billy is a ginger. In "[[The Hobbit]]", [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] states that Billy has narrow shoulders.

==Personality==
Billy is gullible, as he believed Cartman poisoned his lunch milk.

==Prominence==
*"[[Erection Day]]" - Seen briefly giving an alto-saxophone solo at the talent show.
*"[[Tsst]]" - Mentioned being tormented by Eric Cartman.
*"[[The Hobbit]]" - Mentioned.
*"[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]" - Mentioned as a follower of [[Coon and Friends]].

==Trivia==
*When Wendy is mentioning the flaws of other students in "[[The Hobbit]]", every other character she mentions walks up and seems upset by her words; however, when Billy Turner is mentioned, [[Bill Allen]] appears instead.
