The '''Belarusian Farmers''' were a group of protesters and farmers fighting the Belarusian government to keep their land from being developed. They appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, "[[A Scause For Applause]]".

==Background==
[[Stan Marsh]] teams up with [[Jesus Christ]] to help the Belarus farmers keep their land and regain the people's faith. Jesus and Stan visit the [[P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory]] to find a new cause in which they can bring awareness to. They both decide nobody knows or cares about the farmers in the Eastern European country. While in Belarus, Jesus talks to a reporter about his cause but the Belarusian military murders all of the farmers before Jesus can do anything to save them.
