'''Queen Elizabeth II''' is the current head of the [[Britain|British]] monarch, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and Matriarch of the British Royal Family. She appears briefly in "[[The Snuke]]". When she discovers that her warships have been sunk, she commits suicide with a handgun.

She has gray hair, in a very unique style. She wears a white-spotted light blue dress, a jewel-studded tiara, gold (with a jewel in the middle) earrings, and a pearl necklace. She also wears a dark purple sash that has many medals pinned on it. She also has unusually thick, gray eyebrows. She is also visibly aged.

==Personality==
In South Park, she, along with the rest of the British, seem to hold grudges, trying to invade America in "[[The Snuke]]" because of their "rebellion" (The American Revolution). The fact that she killed herself when she learned her plan failed could mean she is extremely patriotic.
