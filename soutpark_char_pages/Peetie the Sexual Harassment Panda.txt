'''Peetie the Sexual Harassment Panda''', also known as '''Tom Morris''', first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]".

==Background==
Peetie comes to the [[South Park Elementary|school]] to teach kids about sexual harassment, although many people point out that they have no idea what a panda has to do with sexual harassment. He is later fired after he indirectly convinces people to sue each other over petty things. His catchphrase is "I’m a saaaaad panda."

It is revealed that he takes his job a little too seriously. He is sent to the "[[Island of Misfit Mascots]]" and later returns to the school as "Peetie the Don't Sue People Panda" after [[The Boys|the boys]] convince him to return to help save the school from bankruptcy, arguing that he has a good message but his current role isn't helping anybody. His new message convinces everyone that their attempts to sue each other are causing too much damage.

===Theme Song===
The first time Sexual Harassment Panda appears, he sings a song. He sings the song in full in his first performance, and only the first two lines in every other appearance in the episode. The lyrics to this song are:

<poem><i>Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda.
Who'll explain sexual harassment to you and me?
Sexual Harassment Panda.
Don't say that.
Don't touch there.
Don't be nasty says the silly bear.
He's gonna tell you what's right and wrong.
Sexual Harassment Panda.</i></poem>

==Appearance==
Peetie the Sexual Harassment Panda is a man named Tom Morris who is only seen wearing a large black and white panda costume. It is not known what his true appearance looks like.

==Trivia==
*According to Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a creator commentary, Peetie the Sexual Harassment Panda is actually [[Santa Claus]] because of his red underwear and his voice sounds exactly the same.
*Peetie makes a cameo in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, "[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]", where he is seen dancing in the crowd, celebrating the end of the [[COVID-19|pandemic]].

==Prominence==
*"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]" - Teaches the students about sexual harassment.
*"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.
