'''Mr. Conners''' is the former wrestling teacher at the [[South Park Elementary]]. He appears in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, "[[W.T.F.]]".

==Background==
Mr. Conners was fired due to the lack of interest among the students in real wrestling. [[Principal Victoria]] confuses the sport with W.W.E. type events and cites the dramatic adult story-lines in the newspaper as well as mistaking wrestling videos on his iPhone with "gay" pornography.

He was also a highly accomplished Olympic wrestler as his living room was filled with awards and trophies.

==Appearance==
He wears a gray wrestling singlet. He also wears large, gray and white sneakers, long gray socks, a gray kneecap on his right knee, and white protective headgear.

==Personality==
Mr. Conners appeared to be very devoted to wrestling, even going as far as to try and kill the W.W.E. President [[Vince McMahon]], in order to show people what real wrestling is. After giving a heartfelt speech to the [[Wrestling Takedown Federation]] audience, Vince McMahon offers him a job and proclaims "Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen". Mr. Conners accepts the offer, backsliding on his former hatred of the W.W.E., now that he is recognized for his real wrestling talents.
