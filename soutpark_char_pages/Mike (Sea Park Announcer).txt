'''Mike''' is one of the announcers at [[Denver Sea Park]] in "[[Free Willzyx]]".

==Background==
[[The Boys]] go to watch a performing orca called [[Jambu]]. After the show, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] stays to watch him for more time. Mike and his co-announcer [[Brian (Sea Park Announcer)|Brian]] decides to play a trick on him, where they would pretend to be Jambu and talk to Kyle and, later, the other boys. They tell the boys that he (Jambu) must go to the moon, where he lives.

Mike and Brian come back the next day to discover the boys had taken the whale in order to send it to the moon. They then go searching around for the boys, first going to [[Donovan Residence|Clyde's House]] after noticing his destroyed fence. Brian starts to regret laughing when Mike did these pranks, but Brian reprimands him, telling him "It was funny". They discover the boys are going to Tijuana and go to find them. Before they can tell the boys the truth, they are interrupted by the police. When the [[Animal Liberation Front]] come to help the boys, Mike gets shot multiple times and succumbs to his wounds later on.
