masquerading as a vigilante under the pseudonym mysterion he unveiled himself after  persuaded them to for the good of  due to the way the characters facial characteristics aretheir eyes lack of noses and mouthit was initially unclear who mysterion was to the audience but the townspeople recognized him immediately   originally  and  intended for mysterion to be a onetime character and had not planned for his identity to ever be revealed or even intended for him to be a particular character and intended him like  only to cause debates among fans however during  mysterion returned in a story arc beginning with  as a member of  and in the followup  his identity was revealed to be  and he possesses a superpower  his familiar inability to die    mysterion was first introduced in  when he appeared near cartman as the coon on the roof of walgreens cartman tried to find out his identity a process largely relying on mysterion tripping up over his own speech but he fails mysterion leaves and reports to the local police station the next night to report various crimes  mostly just public order offenses however the police are quite impressed upon leaving he is confronted again by the coon who feels that he is being ripped off mysterion rather than enter an argument uses firecrackers to distract the coon while he escapes while mysterion recruits  to gather intelligence for him cartman teams up with professor chaos  to take down mysterion  chaos lays a trap to reel in mysterion by threatening to blow up a hospital the plot is successful but instead of a clean take down mysterion  despite coming close to death at one point  comes out on top in a fist fight with chaos and general disarray  afterwards though cartman convinces him to reveal himself to stop these attacks from happening mysterion reluctantly agrees and reveals himself at a press conference although it is still unclear to the viewer a deleted ending shows kyle in prison for vigilantism when the real mysterion turns up and asks why kyle did that  mysterion reveals himself to kyle in private  in  mysterion is a member of the organization called  headed by cartman which fights crime together mysterion seems to be an unofficial leader since everyone respects him over cartman and he tries to convince cartman that there are bigger things to worry about such as the gulf oil crisis than the appearance of a new superhero  who does not actually do anything to stop catastrophes but instead explores what could have been done to prevent them when cartman beats up  and   and  two fellow heroes mysterion and the others vote cartman out of coon and friends and mysterion takes unofficial command as the group leaves to help confront the dark god  released by the irresponsibility of dp formerly bp in drilling  in the continuation  mysterion has decided to keep the group name coon and friends simply because it annoyed cartman who has left to track down cthulhu and ally up with him and he found it extremely funny the group are running a lemon bar stall to raise money to help with the crisis but on return to their hq cartmans basement they find that the place has been trashed by hindsight who had been trying to find pictures of him having sex with courtney love actually butters in makeup he threatens the group with a gun  mysterion after trying and failing to reason with hindsight pushes his head against the barrel and tells him to fire  kyle tells him to chill out revealing him to be kenny in the process but mysterion asks the others to go hindsight tells mysterion his perfect  hindsight is a curse  mysterion manages to push that into insignificance with his own curse his  worsened by the fact that nobody remembers his dying  filethumbleftmysterion in s room later the group meet in clydes room researching the cult of cthulhu on the internet where they stumble across a newspaper article about kennys parents being arrested for cult activity at which point kennys surprise causes him to drop his mysterion voice and express his shock using his true voice while kennys real voice was featured at the end of the  this is only the second  to feature kennys true voice the first being  he questions his parents as mysterion and they reveal where the meetings take place to him  as well as that they only went along for free beer which kenny does not find very hard to believe the group go and spy on the meeting where a particular passage from their book the  interests mysterion having  the  at the meeting since millennia of suffering and darkness sounds pretty goth mysterion confronts them they do not take him too seriously but before he gets anywhere the cult leader turns up and tells them to kill him despite the rest of the group trying to intervene the leader stabs mysterion  who promptly wakes up in his bed the others turn up and   asks kenny why he ran away kenny cannot answer since they will not take him seriously  instead he sighs in resignation  in the conclusion  mysterion ponders where his power came from while the others discuss what their powers are the others do not take him too seriously when he tries to convince them that he actually cannot die  he begins to lose his temper when kyle says he thinks it would be cool to not be able to die  it actually fucking hurts he then begins listing different ways he has died eventually he resorts to shooting himself through the head in front of them much to their shock later the others are once again discussing their powers and where they came from at mysterions serious suggestion that he should explore where his immortality came from cartman then re and seems to be remorseful  but nobody takes him seriously when he convinces them to come outside he has cthulhu banish them to the sunken  aside from mintberry crunch who fled mysterion finds some spikes in a pit and purposely falls on one in order to die and be transported out of rlyeh to wake up in his bed at home in   so that he can find a way to rescue everyone else the improvised teleport works and he returns to the goth kids who are gathered in goth kid henriettas bedroom for information on the cult bradley who is the younger brother of henrietta passes by the bedroom door sees mysterion inside changes into his mintberry crunch costume and he chases after mysterion after he leaves through the window the two eventually track down cthulhu after mysterion reads that it takes an immortal to kill an immortal  cartman had been using cthulhu to kill various people he did not like  synagogues hippie festivals and the city of san francisco had all fallen prey to cthulhu mysterion arrives and confronts cartman who has misinterpreted the idea of being a hero and thinks that it involves making the world a better place for himself rather than other people mysterion eventually demonstrates true heroism and offers his own life to cthulhu in return for his friends  before this can happen though a message arrives from space for gokzarah at first mysterion believes the message is for him but it turns out that the message is for mintberry crunch mintberry crunch subsequently uses his powers to defeat cthulhu and rescue the remainder of coon and friends after the group puts cartman in the holding cell with butters mysterion gives up on trying to convince the others that he cannot die after saying that he is tired and wants to go to bed he commits suicide once again to return home shortly after kennys mother  is  in her own bed with a rapidly expanding stomach and in pain saying that its happening again we then see her and kennys father stuart wrapping a baby up in kennys orange a and placing the baby in kennys bed carol then remarks we shouldve never gone to that stupid cult meeting  filethumbrightmysterion beating up  in  kenny is shown to have kept his alter ego while he is not  fighting crime he has been protecting  after being moved into foster care karen becomes distraught and cries in her sleep mysterion or as she refers to him guardian angel  at the window to reassure her that she would be okay later when karen is being bullied in the school playground mysterion arrives clinically dispatches  and warns everyone to keep away from karen he lights a few fireworks and escapes without further incident finally he distracts the agnostic foster parents by drawing question marks on the bedroom walls leading them on a merrychase he then escaped out of a window left a note on the window where he left a can of blue ribbon after consuming the beer the weatherheads are arrested and kenny was reunited with his family and friends at school   despite everyones insistence on how important mysterion was to the town he appeared to stop relatively small crimes the only crimes we saw him stop were public disorderly conduct and graffiti by reporting them to the police he also beats up professor chaos and general disarray to stop them from blowing up a hospital and his dialogue with chaos indicates that he has probably stopped his evil plots before  the towns insistence on mysterions importance could be an example of their stupidity as they might believe that professor chaos really may be capable of destroying the world  weaponstools in  he is  toting a handgun although he never uses it for his vigilante activities but only to shoot himself on two separate occasions the only tool we had  mysterion to use was a strand of firecrackers which is illegal in the state of colorado in order to escape from the coon mysterion uses firecrackers to distract the school students at greeley when he takes karen away from her tormentor and the crowd around them  mysterion uses a mysterion logo on a spring like the one on his head leaving it on a can of pabst blue ribbon beer as a sign that he was there    filethumbrightmysterions face from  before mysterion was revealed to be kenny cartman had named craig kyle kenny stan clyde and arguably wendy as suspects and during the unmasking cartman claims hed knew it all along he even said so before however mysterion is shown confronting kyle in private which ruled him out mr garrison pointed out mysterion is a member of his class no female had been listed as a suspect on professor chaos and general disarrays wall of mysterion suspects which implies mysterion as a male and in addition the amateur drawing of mysterion shows a clearly male character with a masculine form and jaw as well as a very deep voice also the underwear worn are male underwear even further ruling out wendy or any other female student as a suspect  he is able to move around without aid so he could not have been jimmy or timmy also he remained extremely calm under pressure and did not twitch making tweek extremely unlikely and it could not have been token because mysterion is clearly white clyde was shown sleeping in class during the presentation of cartman and that was the day before mysterion and the coon eric cartman met which some fans claimed he was tired from his activities as mysterion however other students are shown also tired so it may have simply been to illustrate disinterest in the coons identity furthermore this could be interpreted in another way when cartman announced that  would be on the roof of walgreens clyde and the others did not seem to pay attention at all while stan and kenny were all awake listening to him and mysterion confronted the coon at the place cartman mentioned in the class  in the season  dvd the deleted ending of  reveals that the boy unmasked at town hall was kyle and he was arrested as a result mysterion however appeared to kyle outside his cell and revealed his face repeating the gag again while this would also dilute both garrison and cartmans clues it is a general rule of thumb in fiction for deleted scenes to be noncanonical  in  the mysterion suspects are narrowed down to two people  and  kenny and clyde were called out by  and he said i even said it was you unlike  who was not even on  suspect list nor accused by cartman  is shown as a separate hero within mysterions presence ruling him out and  does not appear in the   in  his identity is revealed to be kenny mccormick after he urges  to shoot him  allusions to superheroessupervillains mysterion seems to share similar characteristics with various other superheroes particularly those from dc comics batman franchise matt stone and trey er state on the commentary for  he was intended as a parody of modern dark superhero films using the dark knight and watchmen as examples  the spirit some of mysterions quotes are very similar to those of the spirit one such example is the quote the city needs my help it cries for protection and i will answer the call to save her  immortal man  resurrection man immortal man and resurrection man are similar heroes from dc comics who like kenny are resurrected when they die  batman batman the alter ego of bruce wayne often uses a low voice to disguise himself mysterion did this as well so that none of his classmates or the people he knew as a regular child would recognize his voice the contact that mysterion had with the police was similar to that of batmans partnership with the police commissioner of the city of gotham james gordon both of them report to their respective informants for relaying information about crime also mysterions manner of disguise and choice of words allude to batmans for they both hide their defining features especially around the face and consider themselves symbols of their citiestowns they both speak only when necessary and tend to spend more time alone prowling the streets for crime his reluctance to work with other heroes is also similar  rorschach rorschach one of the central characters of the graphic novel and film watchmen is mentioned by stone and er in the dvd commentary as a major inspiration along with batman for mysterion like batman rorschach has a deep throaty voice similar to mysterions also in one scene mysterion speaks directly to the viewer via inner dialogue and his inner dialogue is similar to rorschachs journal throughout the film and graphic novel  the riddler  one of batmans most prominent foes the riddler shares his question mark icon with mysterion who wears it atop his cloak while question marks mean different things in regards to each they are similar in appearance with the exception that mysterions is bright green and riddlers are many colors   raven a member of the teen titans both raven and mysterion share the following they are the darkest members of their respective teams they share an origin that involves demonic entities raven being trigons daughter and mysterion being related to the cult of cthulhu to top it off their attire is comprised of a hood and robe like cape of similar color spectrums ravens being a dark blue and mysterions being a dark purple   mysterion looks very much like a child superhero as he wears a pair of white underwear briefs over his base suit which is an offlavender and has a bright green m on the front of it around his waist there is a plain thin black belt with a dark grey standard buckle brown boots adorn his feet and olivegreen gloves adorn his hands there is a dark purple cloak that drags on the ground wrapped around his neck and provides a shield for his hair or any defining features this cloak has a bright green question mark made of some type of sturdy material attached to a spring that juts out from the top of mysterions head finally he wears a black halfmask that covers his face from the bridge of the nose up  unfortunately there are little clues as to what features mysterion possesses that makes him distinctive like most children in  s animation style mysterion has a perfectly round head an averagely sized body two tilted oval eyes with black pupils and a mouth he is extremely agile and can run away quickly enough to disappear while a string of fireworks are blowing up  when he shows his face in  that is kyle not kenny as shown in a deleted scene where kyle is in jail and mysterion walks up to him the real mysterion then shows his face however deleted scenes are noncanon in most television shows so this may not hold true     filethumbleftmysterion confronts the  mysterion is the embodiment of the antihero character archetype much of his attitude and view of the world stems from his experiences as kenny from his poverty his willingness to help others in a time of need as well as his inability to convince his friends of his inability to stay dead which he views as a curse most of the time he is calm and calculating making him an excellent strategist however there are times when usually when people fail to take him seriously or in discussions with the coon that his temper gets the better of him  he came very close to lashing out violently at kyle when he said that not being able to die would be pretty cool on another occasion he said that he finds pissing cartman off extremely funny  possibly the only time mysterion has laughed he also displays a different persona than his reallife self coming off as more gruff intense authoritative and grounded whereas kenny usually tends to be more lighthearted easily amused and annoyed also tending to play more of a supporting role with his friends  despite being the nearexact opposite of the coon kenny has used his alter ego to improve his own life to an extent  he convinced his parents to stop beating each other up and abusing their kids stop doing drugs although he has only been semisuccessful with both of these demands and give their children allowances   mysterion seems to be more of a handtohand combat fighter as we see when he fights with professor chaos and general disarray mysterion has great agility as he made it to the top of buildings without the use of ladders stairs or elevators in  he effortlessly beats up a school bully while protecting his sister   in  we are to discover mysterion possesses a superpower  he is unable to die always waking up in his bed every day as if nothing ever happened with nobody remembering his death he has  and is unaware of why himself it is implied however it has to do with the  and the cult of cthulhu in  it was also revealed that he may use his immortality as a sort of improvised teleport since he will go back to his bed after he dies he kills himself to be sent back there he uses this technique to escape the sunken city of rlyeh  mysterion has an unconscious ability to manipulate the memories of others whenever he dies witnesses forget the memory quickly he seems unable to control this power as he constantly tries to have his friends remember his deaths but with little success  mysterion is able to change from his normal clothes to his hero suit at very short notice  between hearing that karen mccormick was about to be beaten up and the bully in question advancing he was able to change clothes find firecrackers for a later distraction and have enough time left to get onto the roof of the school  mysterion is shown to be able to jump high enough to kick a taller girl in the head in  the poor kid  he also shows great strength able to carry karen mccormick on his shoulders and climb up a gutter without struggling  mysterion can jump from great height and not be hurt or at least not be phased by the pain that a normal person would feel he jumps off a building and in front of the goth kids in  mysterion rises  and in  the poor kid  he jumps out of a second floor window in his foster parents house it is possible that since mysterion is always able to come back alive he has been training himself to perform various dangerous tasks and killing himself in the event he gets a crippling injury   mysterion sides with    and cite weburl  the fractured but whole trailer  e publisheryoutubecom  whenever mysterion dies in combat he will spawn into a ghost form gaining a new set
