tone of their parents will match the skin tone picked by the player during the initial creation if their skin tone changes their parents will change along with it besides the skin and hair tone the player can choose the new kids clothing however when he chooses the class or when he level up he will always have a blue jacket and brown pants on him with some additional things in  as a canonical costume if the player chooses to wear it he will have a red balaclava with a yellow star and two metal antennae a blue shirt red gloves with yellow outlines and trousers red with orange anklets   while going to bed he wears a blue formal pajamas with red ts blue ps the heads of  and lime green clouds very similar to s or a red onesie with blue trimmings at the beginning of  the new kid can dress up as a cowboy or a native american        mute nature filedouchebagwakingthumbthe new kid waking up the new kid is mute and voiceless in  and displays little emotion they usually have a blank expression on their face and have only ever spoken once a single line at the end of the game this broad portrayal of the character is meant to keep their personality indecisive and unknown in order to fit it under an umbrella of the possible personalities the player will want to come up with for them  and others occasionally note that the new kid is quick to make friends on facebook  on a few occasions the new kid use facial expressions to get their feelings on a situation across such as when  heals them during combat or when they use the toilet the new kid has an amazing capability to make friends quickly in fact it is revealed near the end of the game that before the age of  the new kid had  billion friends on facebook alone their seemingly unsocial attitude is meant to be subjective and leaves the new kids true thoughts and feelings up to the player to decide  the new kid will sometimes take the role of cartmans messenger instead of speaking theyll simply hand over a note that will contain the information the receiver needs most other characters find their blank expression and their resistance to speak to be a nuisance but others would disagree  called it hot and randy viewed it as modesty   the new kid has more expressions that leave the door open for more creativity and speculation on the personality the player chooses for them making their character more rounded but more indefinite  the rate of their facial expressions has greatly increased in battles where they take damage and are affected by status effects they still react like before they also show other emotions such as complacency concentration or focus when carrying out attacks and they now smile when targeted by a healing ability however these expressions in battle are the same for every character making it possibly a simple ingame feature their mute nature has also been toned down since they grunt audibly on occasions when hit in battle  in the main storyline the new kid looks appropriately shocked and afraid in many terrifying scenes however their feelings remain subjective all throughout the game even when performing tasks such as handing the special drink to  the only major occasions where the new kid has a clear definitive moment of expression is when they are eating dinner as they listen to their parents screaming at each other they sigh disconsolately picking at their dinner disinterestedly to the tune of gloomy music the new kid can also peek through the locked door to see their father gobbling pot brownies later discovered to be spiked with cat urine  the new kid is shown having an even greater attachment to social life compared to the previous game they spend more time on their phone as well they also have greater trust for the companions they help them with their problems and even create some abilities to save other kids later in the game the new kid is forced to sacrifice one of their parents to get the  out of the genetics lab this decision is up to the player which effectively and morbidly shows which parent the new kid prefers  as a possible result of social engagements the new kid developed a sense of rebellion against their parents they started defying suggestions and disobeying commands in specifics they would leave their house at night despite the fact that their parents told them not to they even cracked the locks that their parents put up to prevent them from going out it is unknown whether the new kid is going through a youth rebellion phase or they are just acting like a naughty little kid as they should be  the new kid also shows their ignorance of the people of   and is still nave about the people in the town partly due to only recently moving in  they also show acts of rebellion against their parents while obeying their orders before they now defy their commands and reject their advice they even develop the ability to become ungroundable and the power to unground other kids  while seemingly normal in most cases the new kid has an undeniably uncanny attraction to catastrophic situations they witness the death mutilation and several other unfortunate fates of many of the characters and do not deliver any help they are even forced to murder one of their parents to get the freedom pals to safety  the new kid shows selfdoubt in the mission  they do not believe in themselves therefore making their timefart leap forward through time instead of back   in phone destroyer the new kid is addicted to or at least forced into by  spending countless hours on his phone making him become really good at the game real fast he is also shown to be nave following cartmans manipulative orders into trying to gain more experience on his phone    the new kids most notable talent is their capability to make friends super easy and fast on any social network for example facebook to their friends surprise they once had  billion friends on facebook the government wanted their amazing ability to make friends for themselves but the new kid and their parents moved away in order to start a new life not wanting any unnecessary attention   they also have quite a talent for fighting as  says yeah the new kid may be a douchebag but he sure can fight  the new kid has managed to defeat almost every person blocking their way this includes taking on multiple enemies at once from two or three enemies in the  kkk to a whole pack of raisins girls in the alley  they have defeated kids of their age wild animals large monsters zombies and so on they also defeated enemies with extreme equipment advantages including adults armed with assault rifles and aliens with space ray guns almost every available combatant had been in a fight with them and hardly anyone survived from their powers  the new kid seems to also have a fondness for fighting when it comes to difficult situations they often simply pick a fight and crush the enemy forces without any negotiation attempt this might have something to do with their mute nature which results in their lack in social skills even when they can make friends rapidly online   another notable talent is their farts cartman teaches them the most basic farting ability dragon shout and makes them take the gentlemans oath to never fart on someones balls he later teaches them how to cupaspell and reminds them not to fart on anyones balls randy teaches the new kid a more complex farting ability the sneaky squeaker again telling new kid to never fart on a mans balls they are later taught the most powerful farting move nagasaki by  who remind them to never ever fart on a mans balls and they get them to practice their newly learnt nagasaki on three pedophiles from alberta   the new kids farts reach another level in  capable of manipulating spacetime continuum they acquire their first ability timefart glitch from eating an enchirito and later acquire their second ability timefart pause from eating the cheesy shrimparito later to get inside the gate of  the new kid manages to acquire timefart shift by farting into a powered ac fan finally they eat the ultimate seven layer quesarrito chipotle beefy nacho supreme and gain the ability timefart leap  outside of the story the new kid can optionally acquire timefart summon by consuming the chocolate memberrito   bitch slap the new kid lays down their strong hand to show the girls of a rival

grounded by their parents if they stay out for too long in the forest or after dark the new kid does not seem to accept the authority of adults other than their parents to ground them and can even unground other kids with their touch emotional manipulation the new kid uses puppy eyes to convince the coon to let them have a third and fourth class however this pitiful behavior is strongly implied to be imagined by the coon meaning that how much if any of this is a conscious act on the part of the new kid is unknown some adults however do call the new kid adorable disguise and cosmetics as  in the games the new kid can customize their appearance however they like and their disguise as a superhero can fool almost every person in town their disguise as a person with different racial identities are also transcendent as they can change their skin tone in no time filethumbone of the new kids drawings  in  drawing the new kid has drawn a few paintings as  in the stick of truth their

particularly irritated by the new kids mute nature in correspondence to her husbands drug abuse she was revealed to be an alcoholic kelly has been putting drugs in the new kids food to try to lessen

buddy butters also introduces the new kid to te game at kupa keep so that they can join in butters is the only buddy who verbally reacts when the new kid is idle on their phone implying that the new kid is texting him directly and hinting at a stronger friendship with butters than the new kid shares with their other buddies butters using healing touch on the new kid is the only thing in the game

can still be friends outside of the game  in  professor chaos begins the game in an adversarial role to the new kid and their allies unleashing as many minions as  can buy to put a stop to them

prove themselves he even admits that he is glad the new kid joined freedom pals as there was now another person with real superpowers that he can relate to however this seems to cause some resentment from mysterion likely due to no one believing he actually has a power while the new kids powers are more obvious which causes him to lash out at them even going so far as to accuse the new kid of beating doctor timothy up despite timothy being the aggressor furthermore after the genetics ranch incident mysterion repeatedly blames the new kid for farting them forward in time despite this
