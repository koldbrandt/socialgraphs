the leader of the revived  mentally deranged and now with more visible braces he apparently spent time in a mental asylum during his stay in a said mental institution he became obsessed with making cartman pay for murdering his parents and did research on him and planned to torment cartman with the identity of his real father however the shock was too great for scott so he developed a plan to force the town to present cartmans real father to him apparently a  right tackle had an affair with  and produced an illegitimate child the whole town covered it up because the broncos were having a good year and couldnt afford any distractions scott tenorman revealed his father  was a denver bronco and was the only one who lived in   thus jack tenorman was cartmans biological father which made scott tenorman cartmans half brother in the words of scott you killed your own father and you fed him to your half brother  cartman is horrified and then to top it off scott then shoved cartman into the same bowl of tainted chili that scott ate back then but a moment before cartman eats it the  bust in battling a group of  and the gingers not yet done with his insane schemes scott tenorman escapes using a jet pack with  saying whos the creepy ginger kid  unfortunately scotts plan succeeded in hurting cartman for murdering his parents but not in the manner that he had hoped cartman did not seem to regret killing their father but rather loathed the idea that he is in fact halfginger however cartman managed to find a little bit of solace in the fact that  reminded him he was part denver bronco as well ever since then eric cartman vows to get revenge on scott tenorman once again for the unfortunate events of this    scott has bushy red hair freckles large ears and a piggish nose he wears a gray sweater with a black vneck shirt overtop baggy orange pants yellow socks over the pants and dark blue shoes he also uses braces on his teeth in  he had a wider mouth and his braces were more visible his eyes have darkened around them appearing to have become baggy his hair was very messy and his pants and shoes were redesigned to look more realistic in some scenes he also sported a top hat with a purple brim and a cane     scotts manipulative and somewhat sadistic nature is very similar to cartmans at times however in his initial appearance his cruelty was far more childish and more analogous to simple bullying as opposed to cartmans more elaborate and supervillainous methods this changed in his appearance in  where it  cartmans past actions pushed him down to cartmans level of evil though scott is still less evil as he became awful due to the death of his parents while eric became mentally ill and evil was because he was given everything by his mother  scott makes cartman eat chili at the end of  it is unknown as to whether or not it was tainted with something such as human meat pubes or something else or if it was just ordinary chili used to guilttrip eric   filethumb s recreation of batman the killing joke although scott has red hair he also lacks the aversion to the sun that many of the other gingers have this would make him and his father daywalkers like  he appeared in the background during  during the first scene when it pans to the audience scott revived the ginger movement which was started by his halfbrother  in the   cartmans hatred of gingers may have been the cause of his feud with scott contrariwise scott might have been the source of cartmans prejudice towards gingers scott  in  as the main antagonist the scene in  where scott confronts cartman with the chili concarnival and the rollercoaster is made to look like an iconic sequence from the batman the killing joke graphic novel in which the joker abducts commissioner gordon his voice and mannerisms are akin to heath ledgers portrayal of the joker in the movie  scott came into possession of a jetpack as shown in  he flies away from the chili concarnival lair in a similar way a supervillain might escape including a pithy catchphrase ill be back super best friends despite his cruel personality scott has unlike most teenagers a good relationship with his parents he is proud of them according to the  scott tenorman must die he possibly behaved like this because he otherwise would not get his  dollars a week he is based on  from      first appearance he becomes cartmans sworn enemy   he and his other friends in the same grade as him appear with the th graders because according to   studios faq he and his friends wanted to see  as well   appeared in a crowd at the end of the    appeared watching  presentation    crying at his parents grave cartman gives him a fruit basket as a quick apology for having mr and mrs tenorman killed   it is revealed that after the events of his first appearance he was committed to a mental institution becoming obsessed with revenge on cartman he eventually figures out that his father a player on the denver broncos had an affair with cartmans mother which resulted in her getting pregnant therefore the major twist of the  is that tenorman and cartman are halfbrothers and that cartman unknowingly killed his own father  seasons earlier    at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic    although its canonicity is disputed scott tenorman plays a major role in the video game  on the sixth graders hangout level as the end boss cartman notes he recognizes his presence scotts role in the overarching storyline isnt really explained the players must block him from entering the town at all costs or the level is lost he is not a playable character           ja  ru  zh  categorycartmantenorman family
