after his own  during the fourth season pip was rarely  afterward usually in class or playing with other boys implying that since his characterdecline he had gained more acceptance in school he made one last speaking appearance in  being among the final six of the boys potential friends ironically the last lines they speak to him are pip get the fudge out  in some s such as  pip was missing

butters has assumed although their opinions can be contradicted considering the means of torture of which the two were dealt with are very different pip received lots of physical and verbal abuse as opposed to butters who was not so much as abused but manipulated and cruelly taken advantage of and on occasion butters is accepted into  group whereas pip was outcasted however even butters role has been surmised slightly with  later being considered the least popular kid in school although butters remains a major character while scott has only made a few significant appearances   underage drug

appearance after his titular  pip was cleaned up slightly with a fringe of hair sticking out under his cap on the top left    pip was generally portrayed as a sweet caring kind cheerful laidback character who may be constantly knocked down but always got right back up again the only time he ever seemed to act against this description is in  where the the boys continually called him french despite the fact that he hated french people whenever they insulted him in this way pip would pick up the dodge ball and throw it at whoever was saying it at times with inhuman strength and precision

appreciation for him after he saw how good he was at dodgeball in  and encouraged him to keep up the good work in order to make the   cows team world champions this did not last long as once pip knocks out the final team of players chef realizes that his obsession with dodgeball went too far and thus feels regretful for forcing the children into it as a result he does not bother
