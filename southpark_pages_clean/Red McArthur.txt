in  where she was one of the girls at s sleepover In  she speaks again to  Her role has been gradually increasing since this Before people used to recognize her simply as the redhaired girl who was seen in the background of many episodes  FileleftthumbWendy Lola and Red being approached by   Red has been shown to be one of the very popular girls in the grade She may even be more popular than Wendy or Bebe In many different episodes she has been shown in the background with many different girls In the older episodes she was shown in almost every episode being followed by boys which could

gender war in  Drug abuse In  Red is seen getting high on cough syrup in the girls restroom Graft She along with numerous other girls on the South Park Girls List Committee altered the list of cutest boys so that Clyde would be on the top in order to get free shoes from him This is graft because Red abused her authority for personal gain Sexual harassment She is one of the many girls participating in Bebes sex party in  making unwanted sexual advancements to the male attendants    In  at Bebes party she held  down and tried to kiss him This was most likely because all the girls were acting like
