revealed to merely be a pawn in the grand scheme of things which causes him to become a protagonist in the seasons final     pc principal has committed several crimes already in his so far short prominence several of them only in his debut  assault and battery he viciously beats up  in the bathroom severely to the brink of death primarily for using the term spokesman instead of spokesperson resulting in cartmans hospitalization at  temporarily hazing the pc delta fraternity engages in typical fraternity hazing practices such as branding pledges with hot metal for example  many states have legislation prohibiting this behavior since he is in charge of this fraternity branch the responsibility lies on him to prevent this behavior and thus he is criminally responsible for hazing assaultburglaryindirect hate crime ordered fellow frats to harass  in his sleep and leave pigs  animals which are not kosher and thus offensive to his jewish heritage  in his room the fact that pc

gym with their guns drawn which ended neartragically when he shined a laserpointer into s face causing him to panic and open fire hitting one of the students it turns out he only called in the police to remove leslie from the school this counts as both misuse and abuse of the emergency number  threatening to endanger the life of a minorinfirm threatens to break the legs of the student who used the term retarded in the school newspaper however when the student turns out to be  he chose not to carry out the threat and instead spoke with him in his office over the matter terrorism used the threat of violence numerous times to encourage people to adhere to his pc ideology ie the incident with cartman threatening to break legs over the use of the word retarded in the newspaper murder in  he murders several russians and later kills  who were depicted as robotic advertisements in human form in these instances however it could be considered selfdefense as all his victims were robotic advertisements in human form or their status as nonhumans could also exclude it   pc principal has dirty blond hair and a beard slightly resembling  he visibly had a mustache which is now stubble he wears a blue polo shirt khaki pants and dark sporty sunglasses in which he is rarely  without them off only in  and at the conclusion of  he is heavily implied to be a fitness enthusiast and looks noticeably more realistic than the other characters in terms of build  in the future timeline set in  he  to have gained some weight he has balding gray hair and goatee and wears a gray   cows sweatshirt blue gym shorts and white sport shoes     pc principal is as the name suggests dedicated to political correctness and social justice causes he is a maniacal idealist who passionately supports equal rights for all often to the point of behaving extremely rudely and violently to anyone who shows even the slightest perceived sign of intolerance of any kind he is therefore prone to aggressive profane outbursts over minor transgressions such as  talking during an assembly he is highly dedicated to his beliefs and will stop at nothing to enforce them upon others although he can become very sensitive to the needs of those he feels are oppressed  pc principal generally believes in using punishment to achieve his ends such as up to two weeks of detention such as when  correcting him when the former was talking about  or for not helping  feed out bad tweets he even gives the faculty detention giving  two days of detention for using the term black instead of african american when he feels pushed further he has behaved like a bully and resorted to violence and threats as a form of manipulation beating up cartman and breaking several of his bones he also fires  for a display of racism during an assembly after previously being warned in this situation the firing was justifiable as mr garrison was openly insulting all canadians  he and all his  bros are loud and obnoxious often being characterized as stereotypical frat guys with an uncommon awareness of social justice issues and they describe themselves as loving beer working out and social justice they are perfectly prepared to stand up for equal rights by whatever means they feel are justified pc principal has a wide range of knowledge of equal rights and political correctness issues and initially seems willing to scare and beat anyone who does not share his views demonstrating signs of mental instability unlike his bros he does not seem interested in sexual conquests or pussy crushing  despite his violence towards those who disagree with him pc principal  to be relatively mellow and relaxed when he feels he has won out and can be very patient in these situations he admits that he feels he has changed   successfully in  and  proud of the town he can also be somewhat forgiving as he seems to hold no ill will against cartman in later s in the season and is very sympathetic towards him when he is bullied in  and later realizes and admits to his mistake by putting too much pressure on butters  in  it is shown that he is uncomfortable with handicapped people such as  after threatening to break the legs of the editor of the school newspaper because a student used the word retarded he was stunned to discover a handicapped child had agreed to it and had trouble discussing the issue with him this is because threatening a handicapped with violence which he does with everyone would violate his pc ethics thus handicapped people disarm him of his only method of getting his way he acknowledges the use of a microaggression to his pc frat brothers in the same   after the ad conspiracy pc principal seems to cease and relax his prejudice against straight white men as they are now considered just as disenfranchised by ads as every other group and is not depicted reacting violently to   students anymore so far  he is also a feminist as  when he beat up eric for saying spokesman instead of spokesperson accusing him of abusing his male privileges   watch your microaggressions bro  damn it leslie shut your fucking pie hole   you pc bro   youre expelled   im in a bit of a pc
