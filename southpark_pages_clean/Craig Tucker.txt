   is a member of  fourth grade class Craigs most distinguishing physical feature is his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball One of his traits is his compulsive tendency to flip people off usually for no discernible reason He leads the group known as  aka Craig and those guys He is one of the two children along with Tweek Tweak who are openly gay  While eight years old in the first three seasons he was nine years old by  and as of the  episode  he is ten years old according to the candles on his birthday cake He also speaks with a rather deep voice which is unusual for a child at his age   Craig wears a blue jacket and a matching blue  hat with a yellow puffball on top He wore yellow mittens in  In the early seasons of the series he wore blue jeans but in more recent seasons he wears highwaisted black pants His legs are longer than those of the other children a fact which is clearly visible in  in which he and three other boys from his class wear identical clothes because Craigs pants appear much longer than the others  In  he is listed to have grown the most in height out of all the boys along with  and  all three gaining  inches This implies that he may be one of the tallest if not the tallest boys in the class especially since he appeared to be taller than the others even before his growth One of the reasons he may be tall is that both his parents are shown to be the tallest adults in the town  In  it is mentioned that to place Clyde st in the list they had to move Craig to th place Therefore in the  real list Craig was chosen as the cutest boy in class  Craigs hair is usually shown to be black although it appeared to be brown in  and  In  Craigs eyes are shown to be blue It is revealed in  that he is fairly thin His nasal voice is similar to  but was originally higher in pitch However in later seasons most noticeable since  his voice has been lowered to a similar pitch to Clyde  A few times in the early seasons he is seen wearing a green hat in the background This has been corrected in later airings An example that is still visible is in  in which he appears in the lunch line his hat turns green for a few seconds as the camera moves A greenattired Craig can also be seen in  though some believe that this may be a different character entirely  In  Craig appears as an adult man He appears a lot like his father with a similar chin and balding hair pattern although his hair is black and straighter He also ears a blue shirt with a darker blue color and brown shoulder pads      Craig seems to be the most stoic cynical apathetic and deadpan kid in  having a more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters a trait exaggerated by his deeperthanaverage voice He has been described as pragmatic monotone and sarcastic He also appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers typically being the one to call them out on their ignorance He generally prefers to be left alone harboring very few but simple interests In the making of  it was written on a whiteboard that he only cares about his  and his boyfriend   Craig is implied to have bad behavior and is referred to as the biggest troublemaker in his class by  in  Craig has a habit of flipping people off sometimes to express irritation anger or disdain towards them sometimes as a reflex This is a trait the official South Park website states is learned from his family who are all seen flipping each other off in Tweek vs Craig His habit of flipping people off has been shown much less in later episodes although a later incident regarding flipping off the principal of school ended up with him in detention and it is part of one of his abilities in South Park The Fractured But Whole  The last time in the main series where he is seen making the gesture is  where he and his parents are filmed by a cameraman who gives them an interview His parents are worried and talk about a serious event that occurs in town as Craig just remains blankfaced and flips off the people who watch them on TV  Due to his bad behavior he is frequently sent to s office Scenes involving a character visiting s office will often show Craig sitting in the waiting seats outside the door Craigs most notable interview with  was in  where he flipped  off several times and was sent to wait outside the office again  In earlier episodes Craig normally has a blank face  even when flipping people off This is seen most predominantly in  when he randomly flips off his entire family while remaining a completely straight face If his face is not blank he is frowning for one reason or another  Although all the kids are violent to an extent Craig is shown to be the second most violent after  due to the fact that he seems to be the primary initiator of several of the more severe incidents of bullying that occurred at the school eg  ducttaping  Craig is also shown to be one of the most skilled fighters in the class shown beating up  attacking Kyle when Kyle chooses not to dress like a metrosexual attacking Kenny when Cartman frames him for having lice and beating up several Ginger Kids after Cartmans speech Contrarily in  he appears to have no idea how to fight at all and has to take lessons in sumo wrestling He wields a katana in  as well And in  he manages to knock both Token and Butters unconscious before being knocked out by Stan when he uses a bone as a club to strike him  Later his negative traits are subdued as he is inclined to remain passive and stoical to everything that happens around him An early expression of this is displayed in  in which he approaches his classmates in the bathroom and asks what was going on They tell him they are waiting for Cartman to defecate through his mouth He only answers Oh and leaves immediately  During the  episodes he makes remarks about Stan Kyle Cartman and Kenny and their habit of getting into trouble  he even walks away from them when they want to go deeper into an Inca temple However at the end of the episode after he accidentally walks on the platform and stopped the Guinea Pirate he simply lets out a deep sigh and accepts his fate Craig never once registers shock or any emotion whatsoever during this  he always says things flatly and monotonously even when he says Okay Now theres sparks shooting out of my eyes  Craig has notable leadership skills as he is the leader of a gang who is social rivals with   Cartman and  The first appearance of the group is in  and they are first acknowledged by the main characters in  The main characters are first shown viewing Craigs gang as rivals in  Cartman frequently refers to the gang as  The group usually consists of Craig Clyde Token and sometimes Tweek Jimmy or Jason Craig and Clyde seem to sharealternate in the leadership of their group although given their designation Craig is the primary leader  Another example of Craigs abilities in leadership occurs in  when he leads the male students in their plan to harm  The episode also shows that his assertiveness can also lead to bullying  Craig competes more with the main characters than even the rest of his gang see below In  he opens a television show in the school entitled  which rivals their news show However he seems quite eager to help them at other times as in  in which he is one of the boys trying to get the orca back to its home on the moon Nonetheless he rarely hangs out with the boys by himself he is only seen with them when the rest of Craigs gang is there  In  Stan and Kyles parents decide that they do not want Craig to hang around with them since they had gone missing shortly after him joining the usual quartet They deem him a troublemaker although the Peruvian flute band was actually the others idea and Craig refused to join them until he was told dont be an asshole  In  Craig starts his own show and causes the main characters news show to be canceled because he takes all their ratings hence the title By the end of the episode Craig is not just upset that  got more ratings than his shows the teacher also instructs that Craigs testicles be removed although this was never shown or referenced again  In  it is shown that  and  think that Craig is the biggest troublemaker and make a bet that Craig could easily beat Tweek Tweak Both end up in the hospital Despite trying to rest and give up fighting both break out again when  says to Tweek then Craigs family came on and said Tweek was the wuss and then punched Tweeks mom in the hooters  Despite his past behavior in recent episodes he appears to have matured possibly due to his relationship with Tweek In  Craig is shown to be Tweeks voice of reason using logic in an attempt to convince him that they would not be attacked by North Korea although he is unsuccessful Craig is seen calmly assisting Tweek and tolerating his paranoia while keeping his usual monotone expression After being inspired by Heidi Craig takes a new approach to help Tweek and talks through his emotions with him He also helps Kyle search for Ike after President Garrison nukes Canada in   Apart from his apathy Craig has been shown to be a very rational thinker such as when he tries to use logic to reason with Tweeks paranoia In the game  Craig is seen getting increasingly more annoyed at Mephesto for his ridiculous and wasteful use of resources in trying to attach as many butts to things as possible as well as his absurdly illogical decisions and disregard for basic safety   Assault In  Craig and Tweek are dared to fight each other by the boys The duo inflicts many harmful physical attacks on one another preceding their hospitalization In  Craig knocks Butters and Token unconscious while engaging in a jealousyfilled with the rest of the boys In  he and the other boys bully and beat up Kyle at school just for not joining in on the metrosexual fad to the point where he walked home visibly bleeding and having a black eye In he got in a fight with Tweek again False Imprisonment In  Craig and his gang torment  by taping him to a bench Property Damage In  Craig and the other boys destroy Cartmans electronics out of suspicion that he is the notorious internet troll       Craigs grandmother who appears in flashbacks in Pandemic  The Startling gave Craig  for his birthday She is yet to have any speaking lines as she appears only in a still picture She appears to be a very loving grandmother  Parents  and  In  as  is walking around South Park looking sorrowfully at the others he walks past the  Craig and his parents are shown stepping out of the office at the same time While Token may have been exaggerating in his thoughts about how poor everyone else in town is this might imply that Craigs parents are jobless or that their jobs do not provide enough income for them to get by on it alone  It is hinted in  that he does not have a good relationship with his parents when Cartman says that he helped Craig get revenge on his parents for an unknown reason He also states in  and  that he does not care if his mother is insulted At the same time his parents are shown to love him deeply as they are each openly concerned when Craig is kidnapped in  and are delighted to have him back at the end of    Not much is known of Craigs relationship with his mom but she is shown to be a caring mother She scolded her husband when he responded to Craigs school fight with an apathetic oh She was shown to be neutral at the start of his relationship with Tweek in  and in The Fractured But Whole encourages the player to get them back together  The relationship between Craig and  was explored briefly in  where he originally was shown to have a slightly strained relationship with Thomas Tucker who was shown to be traditionally conservative and unhappy with rumors of his son being gay Thomas later comes to accept Craig as he was and encourages his son to do what makes him happy and that he was proud of him This was what led Craig to make the decision of rekindling his relationship with Tweek but this time for himself instead of for the town   The relationship between her and Craig is difficult to decipher She shares the family behavior of flipping people off with her middle finger She appears to be fond of Tweek calling Craig a fuckboy and asking  to help get Tweek and her brother back together after they had a falling out She has also stated that if Tweek and Craig ever had a kid she would be a cool aunt   Stripe is Craigs pet guinea pig His first onscreen appearance is in  Craig has a very strong love for his guinea pigs and does not like it when Stripe is insulted It was stated in a relationship chart done during the making of The Fractured But Whole that his guinea pig and Tweek are the only two things Craig cares about Based on Craigs dialogue in The Fractured But Whole the current Stripe is Stripe  who was purchased by Tweek and they share ownership of It is also known that Stripe  died after his mom accidentally stepped on it breaking its back and Stripe  might have been poisoned by  after it pooped in the dining room    File laidupgifthumbCraig in the hospital after fighting  In   on account of a bet they had made claim to Tweek and Craig that each had insulted the other and convince them to fight When it turns out neither of them knows how to fight they have them trained for it Craig is trained in Sumo wrestling by Cartman After the fight both boys are hospitalized but the kids fool them into fighting again It is possible however that this fight brought the two boys closer together as they are seen together on very many occurrences in later episodes  In later seasons Tweek and Craig can be seen standing side by side in various episodes including  where they are trapped in a cage together and in  where they are on the same side of the town   In  the new female Asian students draw Yaoi pictures of Tweek and Craig in love despite the two not being together To stop the drawings the twostage a breakup in front of the school to stop the pictures but Tweek goes too far in his role and makes Craig out to be a cheater by inventing a Michael that Craig cheated on for dramatic effect This crushes the towns spirits so the two reconcile in order to appease the town The two are now in a genuine relationship  In the  episode  Tweek stresses over the nuclear bomb threats made by North Korea Craig suggests that he make cupcakes for them and this works until President Garrison insists that Tweek had pooped in the cupcake batter Craig tries his best to make Tweek feel better He gives him fidget spinners to fix his anxiety and gives him logical answers to his problem which only makes things worse But after hearing Heidis speech about grieving he comforts Tweek and talks with him about how he is feeling helping him truly feel better  Although their initial relationship appeared only to be in order to keep the town happy following the events of Tweek x Craig the two have grown closer In  Craig calls Tweek the affectionate pet names babe and honey even when no one is around implying their relationship is now genuine They are also often seen holding hands   and    Token has always been a member of  even when Clyde is not present and the two are often seen next to each other They do not have many onscreen interactions and have only been seen talking to each other in  and  It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Token and Clyde   FilethumbCraig and Clyde in  Clyde is a member of Craigs gang Clyde sometimes leads the group which suggests that he and Craig share the spot of the leader but the position has been confirmed to be Craigs as the group is collectively named Craig and those guys The two are sometimes seen standing beside each other in the background which indicates that the two may be best friends It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Clyde  FileCraigleftthumbCraig and Clyde in the future device in   Clyde and Craig are seen together in a number of episodes whether they are sitting

both fighting because Craig is upset that they took his  In  they both argue that Craig is gayer than   and  Stan and Craig generally do not hang out Furthermore Stans parents and Kyles parents agree on preventing their kids from associating with Craig because Craig is seen as a big troublemaker and having a bad influence on Stan and Kyle in Pandemic Despite the rough points they seem to be on better terms later in the series as seen in  where Craig is attending Stans birthday party and is seen smiling while there    Although Craig and Kyle do not really hang out with each other they can often be seen sitting at the same table for lunch The two have ended up on opposite sides of the field many times though  they argue with Stan Cartman and Kenny backing Kyle up over the Peruvian pan

formed a sort of friendship In  Kenny says muffled I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde There does not really seem to be a doubt Kenny helps Craig with his show in  although it was induced by Cartman saying that Kenny could not join the school news team due to his poverty and the two are partners in  The two have also been seen sitting next to each other for example in  and standing near each other on several occasions this may however just be a coincidence They are not otherwise shown as being close friends In  Craig accuses Kenny of having lice In  Kenny is heard saying I fucking hate Craig at the end this could have been because of how Craig reacted to the situation in that episode and  or that Craig had just refused to fund another of their music bands   Cartman appears to view Craig as a rival trying to prove to him that his gang is cooler than his like in  in which he is the one that proposes the idea of showing off his weapons to Craig A similar thing happens in  in which he wants to prove that he and his friends are gayer than Craigs gang  Cartman has declared his hate for Craig more than once but despite that he says I think Craig is pretty cool but I dont think Clyde is very cool in   Craig actually hates Cartman but he has been seen with him as a righthand man when Cartman assembles a group of boys for his cause like in  or  He is also on Cartmans side of town in  and works for his business in  along with Clyde Butters and later Kyle  Craig is often the main rival of Cartman and the other boys but has sometimes seemed to accept Stan Kyle and Kenny in episodes such as  in which he declares that he also wants to ignore Cartman since he hates him Furthermore he is the only boy who does not apologize to Cartman after he saves the hostages in the Red Cross  Also in  Cartman confronts Craig and asks him if he can stay at his place for a while Craig refuses and blatantly says But I hate you This hatred is not always against Cartman In  Craig and his gang seem to be rivals with Stan Kyle Kenny and Cartman Craig is aware of Cartmans assertive selfish and manipulative nature as well as the fact that Cartman will always get what he wants in one way or another This is shown in  in which he argues with Jimmy that You should consider yourself lucky that he Cartman is only asking for half and tell him to Just give him half This is also shown in  in which he tells Mr Nelson that trying to teach Cartman a lesson is not a good idea   Craig is shown to be close enough to Cartman to sleep over his house for a slumber party

they are at the gas station together when the couple arrives Butters is the mechanic and Craig is playing spaceman In  they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight  However later in the series their friendship seems to have vanished in  Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tetherball while the latter is tied to the tetherball pole   Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not  was present at dinner in  noting Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not which is ironic considering the fact that Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character However a benevolent situation occurs in  in which Butters is looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan Furthermore in  Craig seemed alarmed when he learned of Butters change in behavior by Cartman and followed the others outside the boys bathroom and in  when Butters caused an allergic reaction to himself both of which are unusual for his indifferent personality This may show he considers Butters as something of a friend   Craig probably had a girlfriend before and during  However the player will see that Craig posted on his
