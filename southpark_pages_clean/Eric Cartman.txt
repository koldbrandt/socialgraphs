more than any other character of  some of them are a success or failure   wins the  singing commercial contest however he only got one line lame in the commercial successfulfailure   tries to win a bet over  and  so that they have to be his slaves for a month failure although he did manage to manipulate an entire army of drunken confederate civil war actors to almost split apart the us and never got punished in any way for it failure   proves himself that he is mature and becomes s posterchild unaware they were pedophiles and only interested on account of his youth successfulfailure   had s parents killed grounded them up into chili and fed it to their son success and failure seeing as he kills  doing this but that did not seem to bother him when he found out   bought the theme  with one million dollars he inherited from his grandmother after selling it back to the original owner he blew all his money failure   proved to  that it is possible to defecate out of the mouth after putting

his mistakenly assumed hate crime kidnapping butters framing  for operating a meth lab being with stan marsh on  the prison cartman went to for this assumed crime was japanese and incarcerating hippies in  he along with kyle stan and kenny was arrested by  for assumed school shootings which have been proven to be s attacks he was also arrested for the murders and terrorism of multiple people with cthulhu while under the disguise of the coon by kyle kenny stan  token and  although they did not have the authority even then he was released almost immediately after his arrest the real reason why cartman does not stay in prison for a very long time is likely because his mom bails him out dismissing the severity of the crime another reason why because the town is too incompetent to do anything about it cartmans criminal record includes but is not limited to murder in  cartman stabbed  essentially killing him this can be considered self defense reiner had been trying to lynch him by gathering a mob however rob reiner does appear in a later  proving he did not actually die when he flashbacked to  in  he brutally murdered a messenger boy with a log although this was in his imagination and therefore was not a real crime he was also indirectly responsible for the murder of mr and  in  and many others in  he shot and killed two members of the chinese mafia in  but that was in selfdefense he murdered dozens of people while they were zombies and he did not have to do that as all he had to do was kill kenny he also electrocuted several mexicans to death with a taser after soaking them in water in  prostitution after kyle caused him to have a severe concussion and amnesia in  he begins to think that he was a vietnamese prostitute named ming lee and it is implied that he prostituted himself to  he also did this in  and  but he did not have sex with anyone but actually pretended to be a prostitute vandalism he mentions in  that he had broken a mans fence without telling him about it he also destroyed most of the stuff in butters room with a baseball bat in the same  he even did this in  when he messed up the entire stotch house while trying to find a videotape butters had he tped a house in  and  and since butters was put in jail for it cartman would have but he was praised instead for being honest manslaughter he accidentally bashed kennys skull in  with a frying pan while trying to hit a bug on his face though it was the  side effects and a hallucination he did not mean to legitimately murder kenny when he tried to kill  with a stagelight in  it accidentally killed kenny instead due to the fact that he rigged the wrong one murder by proxy in  although he did not directly murder scotts parents he did know that the situation he was putting them in would get them killed he also conspired with kenny to have  murdered in  resulting in her getting shot he also tries multiple times to convince the others to kill kyle in   and  although cartman does not directly murder anyone he does manipulate  in murdering hundreds of people whom he personally deems evil which includes hippies jews the people of  and  in  cartman uses his german language skills by talking into the germans to kill kyle but this attempt failed he even attempted to do this in  when he kidnapped a student named  and forced him to play a  game by handcuffing his ankle to the school flagpole cartman secretly spiked poison in billys lunch milk and told him that the poison would kill him unless he sawed off his own leg and got the antidote enforced suicide in  cartman was put in an anger management group and while there he used his iphone to send a series of text messages to the wife of the doctor who was trying to get a reaction out of him these text messages placed the doctors wife in a very bad position because in these text messages cartman was forcing the doctors wife to commit suicide in which she does so it is unknown how he got the phone number of the doctor as he required one in order to make a text he banished kenny stan kyle timmy clyde and  to a dark oblivion in  in which kenny was forced to get himself impaled on a spike under a cliff in order to save his friends he does this again in  when he tricks  into eating a cupcake cartman secretly spiked a strong laxative into he causes jenny to crap her pants in class and as a result she attempts suicide the suicide fails and she survives but in the process she suffers a fractured pelvis and had to be taken to the hospital he even did it before jennys accident when he caused one student to crap his pants so much that he needed new clothes from his mother therefore exposing him to the  website and made him think on suicide but in the end he decided not to a year before the  cartman caused the first incident of a student crapping his pants and then made a hazing ritual out of it causing the kid to kill himself animal abuse in various s cartman abuses  whenever the cat attempts to get some of his food in addition it was noted in  that cartman broke s pet cats leg he also smacks  in  after the pig wakes him up attempted murder he attempted to kill     in  using a wiffle bat not comprehending the stupidity of the plan he also attempted to fire on the president of fox in  without realizing his gun was not loaded in  he conspired to kill his own mother because he felt oppressed by her after she hired the dog whisperer  to deal with cartmans spoiled and bratty behavior he also attempted to murder  in  in order to prevent him from crossing the usmexican border attempted genocide in  he tries to exterminate the jews and in  he tries to get people to wipe out the gingers when he becomes one he instead plans to kill all nongingers not wanting to live out his whole life as a minority in   and  cartman along with  attempt to wipe out the jews by attacking assorted jewish temples enforced cannibalism in  cartman tricks  into killing scott tenormans parents then cartman takes the corpses and grounds them up into chili so he could serve it to scott tenorman in the chili con carne festival cartman does so and therefore tricks scott tenorman into cannibalism in  cartman mistook kennys ashes for chocolate milk mix and drinks him and eventually became possessed by his soul assault done several times although many of these are not crimes but in fact just fighting with friends he beats up jimmy in  when jimmy is not expecting it and considering he is handicapped it could be a crime in  he also attacks a man and woman with the claws on his hands scratching the mans face up and causing the woman to run away in terror he thought the woman was being raped in  cartman brutally assaults  and mosquito with the metal claws on his hands for absolutely no reason at all cartman does this again in  when he beats up a little girl in an airport after she asked him what mintberry crunch was like he attacks  and token with a rock causing to have their arms broken which is mild assault but cartman gets arrested for a hate crime instead smuggling he became the leader of a fried chicken cartel in  however this does not count as a crime because the  was not really outlawed and really had some of the restaurants shut down drug possession in  cartman gave some crack to the babies that were diagnosed with fetal cocaine syndrome and then videotaped them playing with the bag of crack and put it on the internet he also gave crack to a women who was addicted to cocaine and was pregnant with her child the crack he possessed may had come from his mother and she was  smoking it after having sex with two men in  theftobstruction of criminal investigation cartman stole the dead bodies of mr and mrs tenorman off a crime scene while  was investigating it is also mentioned in  where cartman had stolen everyones televisions while they were out getting drunk on the streets armed robbery in  cartman gets kyle into a stickup cartman was pointing a gun at kyle and demanded that kyle give his  to cartman kyle gives cartman a bag of rocks first and then presumably throws another fake bag into the fire in  he robs two kids of their  with a laser gun which was presumably expensive violation of firearm lawsthreatening with a deadly weapon the glock pistol that cartman carries is almost certainly illegal and unregistered although it is never explained where he obtained the gun it is likely he obtained during the events of  the glock is the same gun he used to fight off the chinese triads during said  he constantly uses it to threaten people such as kyle and the president of fox in  he also stole a taser from his mom in order to defend himself from  in  arson in  cartman and the boys tricked trent boyett into starting a fire in which the boys believed they were able to put out with their own urine but were unable to in  cartman and the boys were smoking outside school and threw their cigarettes away to avoid being caught by  but the cigarettes landed near the school and accidentally set it on fire however all of these arsons were accidental and unintentional he did it again in  but he committed this arson in his very own room he was told to grow up so he ended up dividing his personality into all of his stuffed animals and then getting rid of the stuffed animals through brutal and weird ways he did not mean to set his own room on fire and might had been sleepwalking when he did it he caused the fire in order to get rid of  graverobbing in  cartman stan kyle and kenny unearthed  from a cemetery and planned to use it to scare the living daylights off a couple of  this brought up false rumors about some of the people in  having sex with corpses and brought the pirate ghost hysteria to a whole new level hate crimes he bashed tokens head with a rock in  although he was later proven not to have done this to token for racial reasons and therefore was released from jail almost immediately after his arrest but it still counts as a mild case of assault however his attempts against jews hippies gingers and nongingers while he thought he was one may count as his motivations are specifically because they are members of this group his actions with cthulhu against jews hippies the people of san francisco during the events of   and  cartman along with  perform numerous terrorist actions against assorted groups cities and individuals could also be considered hate crimes kidnapping and false imprisonment he locked butters in a bomb shelter for three days in  and kidnapped  hippies and trapped them in his basement in  he also held the hakeems prisoner in  though this was governmentsanctioned and he took butters from the mental hospital without permission from officials in  unlicensed surgery in  he stan and kyle performed unlicensed liposuction on butters with a hose in order to get him thinner in hopes of getting money from a weight loss scam they even framed butters by simply running away and hiding causing yet another grounding for butters from his parents terrorism cartman admits to this when he is trying to get  pulled both through threats from islamic bombers and through threatening the fox president with a hand gun he also formed an antichinese organization with butters in  and held an entire building full of hostages on the gun point with butters wounding  police officers and a civilian with badly aimed gunshots his attempt to split up the us through manipulating a drunken army of erners to plunder towns and march on dc might also count although this was not for political reasons so much as it was for making stan and kyle his slaves in  he tries to bomb a hospital to lure out  by planting dynamite on it he managed to set the explosives but ditched the plot and decided helping mysterion would be more preferable in   and  cartman along with  perform numerous terrorist actions against assorted groups cities and individuals he also participated with his anger management classmates and  in  in terrorizing a fedex building and threatened to not release the hostages until their demands were met war crimes the drunken ern civil war army he led is  looting pillaging attacking civilians and burning down buildings it is also implied by cartman at one point his troops are raping women when he offers kenny a spot in his army he says join me and you shall have many plunders and women although he does not specifically reference rape he also employed at least two other child soldiers kenny and butters medical terrorism in  cartman sneaks into kyles room draws the hiv contaminated blood from himself and squirts it into kyles mouth giving him hiv in the process this is medical terrorism because cartman intentionally makes someone critically ill in order to satisfy a desire for revenge the motive for this was that kyle was laughing at cartman in disbelief after hearing that his archnemesis received a deadly virus that would kill him within less than a decade cartman thought that kyle was being insensitive and gave him the hiv virus so he would not laugh at cartman anymore violation and obstruction of the pure food and drug act in  cartman pretends he has  by placing multiple hamburgers in his butt he gave one to kyle who liked the burgers a lot cartman then started a hamburger business in which he placed multiple hamburgers up his butt to give them the taste kyle loved he was later found out about this and his business was forced to shut down this violates the pure food and drug act because cartman put hamburgers up his butt and the sold them to customers since the burgers were up his butt they were contaminated and might had some bacteria and e coli in them which is known to make people very sick some of the kids who ate the burgers might have gotten sick and some customers might have died from e coli he does this again thrice in  when he spiked laxatives into several cupcakes and tricked several students into eating them he even does this in the same  when he made the school faculty spike laxatives and horseradish into pizza in order to make the entire school crap their pants he also did this to mr mackey in the hallway and made him crap his pants and fart his whole body across the hallway piracy in  he assembled several groups of somalian pirates to plunder ships in increasingly aggressive ways until all his pirates are shot to death by us snipers this crime in his criminal record is ignored by the government because they thought that cartman was a hostage of the pirates due to his skin color breaking and entering in  and  he broke into kyles room the purpose for this was to steal one of the  triangles of zinthar and give kyle hiv he also broke into the veal ranch in  cartman also broke into several houses in    in order to steal televisions credit fraud and identity theft in  cartman steals his mothers credit card and uses it to buy plane tickets to cairo for himself clyde butters  and  he also uses her visa card to rent an  in  embezzlement in  cartman starts his own church after he and the kids catch  having sex in the church confessional with clyde donovans aunt cartman made every kid in   into evangelists and asked for their money for charity however in reality he was taking full advantage of them because he was actually taking all their money and was spending all of the supposed church money on himself therefore it counts as embezzlement underage drivinghit and run in  eric cartman hijacked a race car and ran over several spectators and pit crew members culminating in the deaths of eleven people he later does this again going off the race track and into a trailer campsite presumably killing many people in addition to all this he purposely ran over another driver danica patrick on purpose after she was eliminated from the race resisting arrest in  cartman escapes from custody after being found guilty of committing a presumed hate crime cartman bribes kenny to drive him to mexico in his battery operated kiddie car and therefore puts the police in a wild goose chase with it ending near the usmexico borderline he does this again in  when sheila and the boys found out that cartman selfishly kidnapped butters and locked him in a bomb shelter therefore scaring all of   so cartman could go to  for kyles th birthday when sheila says that the police were on their way to arrest cartman for the kidnapping of leopold butters stotch cartman runs into the restaurant and tries to avoid the police as much as he can while enjoying what casa bonita has to offer in the process the chase therefore ends after cartman tries one last ditch effort to resist arrest by jumping into a foot waterfall only to get cornered and arrested child abuse in  cartman made some babies diagnosed with fetal cocaine syndrome play a game of basketball with a bag of coke and videotaped it this counts as child abuse because cartman was making a profit out of this and did not give the babies any credit which counts as slave labor shoplifting in  cartman goes to a local grocery store with butters in hopes of finding vagisil there while in the store butters forgets to bring money with him to buy the  because cartman did not tell him to cartman then decides to ingest multiple vagisil products in the store and then leaves without paying for the vagisil blackmailing framing false evidence in  cartman aka  tries to blackmail  in order to have him join the superhero team he also framed trent boyett twice in  for arson and the assault of a teacher in order to get out of trouble and avoid his wrath for five years he also commits blackmail in  when he pressured kyle into seeing the passion of the christ and told him to have the jews apologize for the death of jesus however this kind of blackmail was emotional blackmail because cartman did not threaten kyle with extortion or with a videotape or photos another example of his blackmailing is shown in  when the joozian producers were caught having weird alien sex they were sucking each others jagons while high on alien drugs in front of him and the other boys kenny takes a picture of the joozians doing this and cartman takes advantage of this by using it as blackmail however this crime may not count because cartman broke this law in another planet and was doing this in order to save earth from being destroyed unfortunately cartman may be held accountable for this in the intergalactic justice system because he broke this law on another planet and may be an example of extradition however again cartman got his memory erased and could not remember anything about this blackmail at all also in  some people who had supernatural powers accused cartman and his false ability of being a fraud and sued him in order to avoid the lawsuit cartman intentionally framed this group of people for the murder of  and it caused the group to get arrested with one of their members killed by police he even framed his mother in  after he found out that his family has the second lowest income in   he engineered a plan to get himself into a foster home by creating a meth lab in his backyard and framing his mom for it therefore getting her arrested the police however found out about this later and arrested cartman and placed him in jail for two months torture in  he used farts to torture the hakeem family however this does not count as actual torture because cartman does not use any weapons but rather his own gas to annoy and provoke the hakeem family what cartman did to the hakeem family was actually government sponsored and therefore is not branded into his criminal record unfortunately in  cartman kidnapped a student named billy turner and forced him to play a jigsaw game cartman secretly spiked poison into billys lunch milk and handcuffed him to a school flagpole then cartman forced billy to torture himself by cutting off his own leg in order to get the antidote fraudplagiarism in  he replaces the words baby in love songs with jesus which is plagiarism and fraudulent as the band is not technically christian rock he also pretends to be mentally disabled twice in  and in  he also does this in  when cartman decides to go on the  show and pretend to be an out of control teenage prostitute for the sole purpose of obtaining a valuable prize after butters unintentionally scams him of one by appearing on the same show as a practical joke by the boys and with fake testicles attached to his chin rape in  he gave butters a blowjob technically without his knowledge and puts butters penis in his mouth it is also implied that he and his men raped women in  and  but this is not proven forceful confinement during the events of   and  he as the coon forces butters to stay in a small jail cell in his basement he also locked away  hippies in his basement in  contempt of court in  cartman sues stan for sexual harassment and then took full advantage of him in court however in this crime cartman was being used by kyles father gerald broflovski so he could make money by telling cartman to sue  too vigilantism due to cartmans attempts at crime fighting in  and his violent methods of dealing with crime he is technically in violation of the law regarding vigilante actions however due to his constant ineffectual attempts this is overlooked by   authorities submitting false evidence in  cartman uses the lie he made about  killing all of the smurfs as the key plot device for his movie he then uses the movie to frame wendy by poorly dressing up as her and then doing the same thing he claimed that wendy did not only did he provide a sneak peek for all of the students of   elementary to see on his morning show but he also released it on dvd and bluray to stores all across america this lawbreaking led to the creation of the movie avatar slander in  cartman declared not only in general but on national tv that his own mother liane has fucked him all because she refused to let him have an ipad while he is speaking figuratively the audience and  assume him to mean it literally in a slightly less liable manner cartman also slandered wendy in  he accuses her of being a slut embezzling money from the school genocide of the smurfs and numerous other atrocities but escapes legal liability by adding allegedly at the end he also does this in  when he told the cia that the hakeem family were a group of terrorists however this lie serves a very good purpose because cartman ended up stopping the british from invading america because of that lie hitchhiking in  cartman hitchhikes to washington dc to get kyle to suck his balls but in the state of colorado hitchhikers can face up to two years in prison theft in  when the boys are building the ladder to heaven cartman steals a seat from s car cartman mentions that mr garrison did not throw away his car so he obviously did not do it with permission child pornography in  he tells kyle he has taken and published photo of his penis on the intenet    manipulation and leadership ability filegingerkids thumbcartman as a ginger kid in  you are such a manipulative asshole cartman kyle upon seeing cartman manipulate the gingers into doing the opposite of what he had previously told them to do in ginger kids  yes but at least im not going to die  in which cartman for once agrees with kyle as he admits that he is manipulative because that is likely what he does in almost every   cartman is often shown to be a poor student but excels in leadership and team organization which usually involves exploitation of others weaknesses although having his origins as a secondary role as the comic foil cartman has evolved into a character of stunningly articulate manipulative talents and techniques his abilities are deeply machiavellian in nature and his character follows closely in the footsteps of other famous manipulators such as the character iago from william shakespeares othello in several s throughout the series he employs this skill to get what he wants his most frequent targets are adults and  though he often targets other children for more personal purposes including convincing butters to take one for the team and be anally gangraped by men from  in  and repeatedly convincing kyle that he is doing good only to exploit kyles help later on he talked the ginger kids out of killing all nongingers after kyle told him that they had played a trick on him in  earlier in that  he had rallied all the gingers into a genocidal frenzy convincing them that all nongingers are inferior in a hitler or kkkesque way as well as stage violent protests and march down the streets chanting red power he then made them kidnap all the children in town and hold them in a cage over a pit of lava but managed to convince them to stop when he was told by  that his case of  was a prank along the same line in  he is able to rally all the members of the  fan club to march through the town while yelling wir mssen die juden ausrotten we must exterminate the jews however it should probably be noted that they were ignorant of the true meaning of this phrase mistaking it for aramaic but given the fact that it caused a large argument in the middle of the city between his group and some jews and given the violent and ignorant nature of most adults in   it would not be surprising if it had turned into violence if allowed to continue cartman was also shown smiling in the background at the argument as if all was according to his plan he also demonstrates great understanding of the human mind and the way to exploit it in the   cartman was able to drive several nannies from his house with insults and insinuation even causing one to be put in a mental hospital in the same  he also made one child saw his own leg off in a reference to the movie saw  cartman is a good strategist organizer and speaker he devises elaborate plans to achieve his goals sometimes presenting them to his friends using a whiteboard in  he comes up with  and later  to get the the listtriviathe fake listgirls list into the boys possession in  when everyone else gives up playing  he devises a plan to defeat  and successfully motivates the other boys to join him in  growing sick of school he devises a plan to go to  to become a pirate he successfully convinces  to join him and leads the expedition  cartmans perceived stupidity by his friends can be attributed to his sometimes naive careless behavior however his uncanny skill at manipulation bilingualism and ability to create elaborate schemes which are often effective imply a high intellect despite his ignorance cartman seems to have no problem talking to people and speaking in general he has an uncanny way with words and uses that to his advantage whenever he plots an idea for example in  cartman delivers a speech to the united states house of representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research he also  to be multilingual though not very well  he claims to be able to speak spanish in  when he tells a n freedom fighter that he wants burritos and in  he actually speaks spanish to the mexican workers hired to smear butters home with excrement in  cartman again demonstrates his proficiency in spanish when hiring mexicans to write an essay which the immigrants mistake for the spanish informal word for a friend ese on the old man and the sea he is the only one of the children in   to speak spanish fluently as shown when kids go to him when they cannot understand people although he is sometimes prone to grammatical errors such as the previously mentioned example in  cartman also speaks german but most of his words are mispronounced leading us to assume he only knew a few nazi slogans however in  these assumptions were proven incorrect as it was shown that he was fluent in german with him proclaiming drfen wir der kind dortgeboten we can offer the child  here er ist jud eh ein schner safter jud er ist friiisch und wunderhbsch wunderhbsch hes a jew eh a handsome soft jew hes freeesh and beauuutiful beauuutiful  in  he exploited a controversy involving the appearance of muhammad on family guy to try to get the show off the air he pretended to be the hapless victim of an islamic terrorist attack to try to discourage the fox president and the family guy staff writers from airing the   on another occasion he was able to convince the majority of the adults of   as well as many people from other cities and the entire state of  carolina to nearly take over the us via an outofhand reenactment of the civil war as long as he kept them drunk so they would not realize what they were doing  cartman is also a very good leader as a pirate captain in  when he convinces all the somalian pirates to join his crew and causes so much trouble to international shipping that the united states navy had to track him down and kill his crew  filescotttenormanmustdiegifthumbleftthe aftermath of cartmans greatest triumph in  cartmans shining accomplishment according to s list of cartmans  greatest moments came in the   a testimony to cartmans hidden ingenuity and cunning as well as the full extent of his cruelty and mental imbalance  continually defeats cartmans attempts at retrieving a sum of money scott tricked him out of throughout the  humiliating cartman and elevating his hatred and desire for revenge finally cartman gets the last laugh as he indirectly coerces scotts parents into a situation where they are trespassing and are consequently shot and killed cartman then steals the bodies and makes them into chili which he promptly feeds to scott cartman then coolly tells scott how his parents died hints at what happened to their remains and inquires about his chili do you like it do you like it scott scott is traumatized and horrorstricken and cartman gloats and laughs hysterically at the inconsolable tenorman while licking scotts tears of unfathomable sadness off his face with intense pleasure however scott discovered that jack tenorman was also his father much to his shock but not because he killed his own dad but because he is halfginger ever since cartman vowed to get revenge on tenorman again and get the last laugh  cartman has also organized several groups of boys when rallying against his enemies including an online griefer in  and the girls on at least  occasions where he tries to obtain a future telling device in  and when he captures a list of what the girls declared the cutest guys in  the boys following cartmans plans he is always the leader and manages to lead all the boys in the group into success almost every time butters kenny or  usually act as his righthand man and recurring members of the groups include token craig clyde kyle stan kenny and butters but most of the time they with the exception of butters and sometimes clyde seem to realize how mentally imbalanced he is  during the   the psychologist started to criticize his obesity as a way to test his anger as cartman was suspected to have anger management problems during the time of being yelled at cartman does not seem to demonstrate any angry response and simple allows the psychologist to curse cartmans obesity and even proceeds to sends a text messageemail on his iphone in a nonconcerned manner almost immediately on the psychologist receives a phonecall from his frantic wife claiming that she moments ago received a police report about the psychologist having an affair with an underaged girl confused the horrified doctor hears her shoot herself with a gun over the phone looking back at his patient cartman says in a cold voice im not fat im big boned this cruel oneline comment along with the fact the supposed police report came from a  indicates that he was responsible for her suicide due to the doctors remarks this may echo the scott tennorman incident stressing the importance of why it is not a good idea to provoke cartman as terrible consequences may ensue if you are not within his immediate circle of friends  ventriloquism cartman has been shown to be an expert in the act of ventriloquism as shown in   and  it is also shown that cartman sometimes uses his talent to express his delusional side he demonstrates this through his hand which he calls  in  his hand has an affair with  gets signed onto a record company and almost gets him killed by  he seemed go through all of that solely for the purpose of tricking the rest of  although in  it is shown that  may be a real being as he was shown to possess knowledge that cartman did not  electronics cartman is shown in  to send a message to an anger management psychologists wife in mere minutes making it look like a police report cartman had to find the location  number of the psychologist in order to send the message cartman is also shown to type very fast as he wrote apparent emails about a teenage girl having a sexual affair with the psychologist  multilingualism throughout the entire run of the   series there have been a few instances where cartman spoke languages other than english quite well and he does seem to be fluent in spanish and speaks very good german for the sake of   for example in the passion of the jew when cartman dressed as hitler while rallying outside the theater presenting the passion with a group of christian followers he began chanting hateful comments to jews in german such as es ist zeit zu subern its time to cleanse while the crowd replies wir mssen die juden ausrotten we must exterminate the jews next cartman exclaimed es ist zeit fr rache it is time for revenge and the crowd replies wir mssen die juden ausrotten we must exterminate the jews while cartman did not necessarily pronounce the german words correctly it was pretty clear that he understood what they meant in english and his followers did not  in  the boys decided to start their own peruvian band to earn some spending money when they spotted a real peruvian band stealing their spotlight after the other boys first confronted them in english and the band members continued to play as if they did not hear them since they did not speak english cartman began yelling at them in spanish generally telling them to stop playing in their area the band paused for a long second in confusion then continued to play this then prompted cartman to repeat what he originally told them in spanish and out of anger he even snatched one of their instruments away and threw it off into the distance  also in  he spoke to mexican workers in fluent spanish suggesting that he is in fact fluent or knows a few phrases he also speaks french to clyde in  as voulezvous coucher avec moi clyde or would you like to sleep with me clyde this however is a line from the song lady marmalade and considering the meaning of the phrase likely means that cartman does not actually speak french granted there really has not been much focus on this particular talent of cartmans since most of the story plots do not focus on it so theres virtually very little known as to how he learned these other languages so well at such a young age it is possible that his mom liane cartman may have personally taught him the other languages as was revealed in  when she purchased a educational game that helped cartman to improve his spelling skills  in  cartman speaks german to the germans seemingly offering them kyle as a way to make peace with them or just kill him  music  cartman  to be musically talented he plays the piano quite well in the   although the piano plays by itself whilst he is singing so it may be a player piano and cartman cannot play it the violin in  the french horn in  the drums in  the harmonica in  and  the recorder flute in  the acoustic guitar in  and pan flute in  he is shown to be randomly strumming a guitar and beating the drums so he is not too good at them  his christian rock group  sold  copies of its album in the   with the intent of earning a platinum album but according to the christian music association their artists only receive myrrh for this achievement  in the film  cartman is shown singing in mock versions of chinese french dutch and an unidentified african language by singing   in  cartman sings  despite several interruptions  in  he sings and does a german dance to raise money for chefs legal fees  he founded a boy band named  in the    cartmans musical tastes run toward progressive and arena rock in general and maudlin power ballads in particular  shows for the first time that cartman has the uncontrollable urge to finish singing s  whenever he hears any part of the song which he can do under pressure in  seconds possibly a sign that he has a very minor case of ocd based on the fact that he mentioned it was not only songs he had to finish in  cartman sings  to the united states house of representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research cartman also  to enjoy teen pop as demonstrated in his  dance sequence in  he also quotes haha charade you are from pink floyds song pigs three different ones during a scene in  cartman sings the lady gaga song  while playing the video game rock band with kenny as the drummer this song was later released as a real downloadable single for the game  cartman frequently bursts into song spontaneously sometimes with melodies and topical lyrics of his own devising although his musical talent is questionable he often uses this skill in order to persuade others by using the song to manipulate their thoughts and emotions this penchant for ad hoc songs was specifically mentioned in  this also happened in the   when stan asks cartman to donate a kidney to a very sickly kyle cartman replies by singing no no no no no no no no no no to the tune of comedy tonight from a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  in a meanspirited feeling cartman begins singing an elvis version of  when in kennys neighborhood namely the poor part of town  for rushs snakes and arrows tour a short animated clip was made to introduce the song tom sawyer featuring the boys from   as a band attempting to perform the song cartman is featured as the lead singer geddy lee in  he bursts into song singing kyles moms a bitch he also did this in  despite kyles repeated warnings  cartman has also been featured on several tracks on all three   albums  photography cartman knows a bit about photography as shown in a few s in  he demonstrates his knowledge of the nature of music artists album covers such as how the members of a band are mostly in random places looking in other directions and never smile also in  cartman takes up his hobby of inviting butters over just to take embarrassing photos of him he is also shown presenting a slideshow in class and comments about them skillfully also in  and  he is talking about how he should take his picture of kyle sucking his balls he even has professional help with his photo shoot in part iii also he is good at photoshop though his art skills are very first grade like as we can see from  when he is framing kyle  sports cartman has been bad at sports and sometimes good he has been  playing center in football in  and on the dodgeball team in the   he plays baseball as he is  hitting a home run and plays catcher on the baseball team as  as one of the three players   and cartman hitting a home run in   in  he is  playing street hockey along with the rest of the boys as a goalie in later s  and  cartman is  to be playing basketball with the other boys however he is not nearly as talented as he seems to think or the others he often cries out stop cheating you black asshole when an opponent beats him or you tricked me as if this was illegal however cartman seems to have a grasp of cheating strategies as  in  cartman tries out for the wrestling team in  but leaves after he is put into a gay move by  who was told by  to do so in the same  he formed a wrestling league along with some of the other boys however the wrestling in which they performed was more dramatic theater in which they created complicated in depth story lines for their wrestling personas rather than actual athletic prowess  cartman is also  as a not very good swimmer in  cartman is upstaged by handicapped children in  where his elaborate plan to beat the handicapped children in athletics backfires with him placing dead last in every sport in  he performed so poorly on the schools gym athletics test that it brought the schools average down to the worst in the country  weaponry cartman is shown carrying more weapons than any other kid in   although where he obtains these weapons is never properly explained he has been shown using a dagger when trying to stop stan and kyle from destroying the  and a pair of sai a japanese short sword in  he never actually struck anyone with these weapons although it is pretty obvious he could have  in the early   cartman receives a nightstick otherwise known as a baton due to his duty as police officer he constantly uses it to abuse suspects and criminals usually hitting them in the legs  in  cartman is  brandishing a bowie knife  in  he also was shown using a very potent type of mace designed for use on bears he uses it with gusto on suspects and people evading capture as well as on people who probably did not need it the rest of his crew uses the same mace  cartman also carries around what  to be a glock  pistol that has been  in a few s he however has never fired it and only uses it to threaten people he used it to persuade kyle into giving him his jew gold in  in  cartman used it to threaten the president of fox however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration in  when he and butters stormed a chinese restaurant and he orders butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders although cartman begins to regret giving butters the firearm as butters keeps accidentally shoots men in the dick his most recent use of the weapon was in  where he threatens  at gunpoint who soon after reciprocated the action  despite the fact that he has many weapons at his disposal he does not seem to be very good with them in  he is  firing an unidentified assault rifle although he never can land precise shots with it due to the recoil making cartman flail his arms around although this is understandable as  year olds are not generally intended to use firearms he killed two chinese but he was not aiming at them he also shows an inability to use his dagger when fighting kenny over the wallmart although it is likely he either had no interest in killing kenny only use the dagger for threatening people or that he was too preoccupied with kenny lightly slapping him to use it  cartman uses bladed finger gloves similar to freddy krueger when dressed as the coon cartman beats up several people with these weapons mint berry crunch and the mosquito at the same time though it was a surprise attack a little girl in an airport several adults in an attempt to stop murders and rapes and fights off  and  though he is eventually beaten this shows skill though most were surprise  cartman gains the ability to fire electricity at people in  by way of a defective  cartman uses this ability by using words that are considered naughty cartman kills a black demon and is shown beating  in a fight whereas the military could not even harm him with machine guns cartman also rises into the air after a chain of naughty words including  cartmans electrokinesis is gone in the show most likely removed as a result of  making everything go back to how it used to be as per kennys final request  in  cartman successfully engineers  subconsciously in a psychotic delusion  the deaths of all his stuffed animals cartman kills  by slicing him open in several places and crucifying him to a tree showing skill with a blade and enough strength to force sewing needles into a tree he kills peter panda by setting him on fire while sleepwalking he kills  by supposedly boiling him alive he hooks a bomb collar he apparently made himself onto wumpletumpkins showing immense skill with traps and explosives as well as creating and inventing deadly weapons that could be used by the military and he shoots  in the head with a magnum revolver several times and using the entire load case of the gun which was  shots total showing incredible marksmanship never missing a shot and always hitting the head and not damaging the chair at all despite the recoil the revolver had  cartman along with the ret of the town gets addicted to guns in  although he does not fire one  cooking in the   cartman is shown to be able to cook hamburgers very well if only achievable after putting them in his underpants  cartman also makes something called a toaster pastry chocolate mix butter bar by taking two pop tarts and sandwiching them with a stick of butter covered in chocolate milk mix in    filenthumbpicture from cartman on facebook cartman has a facebook account as  in  he ran a regular podcast named mad friends parody of mad money the  is based on the ever growing  craze he tried to help kyle delete  and get new friends by using chat roulette but the only result he got were men masturbating and pictures of penises in the real world he has a facebook account which is run by someone from    in the   cartmans backpack is shown with a tag that reads e cartman  e bonaza cir   co  heroic momentsheroism in  his intolerance of hippies saves   from a drugfilled hippie music festival in  his frequent use of vulgarity after getting electrocuted by a power box coupled with the experimental vchip implanted in his brain to stop him from swearing which gave him temporary electrostatic powers deliberately helps save the world from saddam hussein in  by filling his tivo with the history channel and dropping it and himself into a pool he able to travel back in time to  where he is able to institute the american tradition of ice cream thursdays and return to   with a special th  message about war and peace in  cartmans intolerance against muslims and his use of racial profiling save the day in  cartman is the boy that figures out that by shutting down  the elderly would not have anywhere to get food this being one of the few occasions where the boys rely on cartmans planning but only to an extent cartman wanted kyle to suicide bomb the buffet but stan overruled that and said they would only lock the doors in  cartman is under the belief that he was a ghost trapped on earth until things were made right he distracts three escaped convicts who were holding ten people hostage at the red cross while  lets them escape also in this  cartman makes up for all his previous wrongs such as the  incident  the preschool incident  feeding parents to their child  and crapping in the s purse seven times though he was not really sorry in  he saves s family from a smug storm however this is due to the fact that cartman had no one else to taunt and insult in  cartman   and  logged into  together to kill the player killer  character first stan retrieves the  from his dad then kenny shoots his arrow and kyle uses magic to paralyze jenkins character and finally after cartman says looks like youre about to get pwned he crushes the player killers head with his war hammer in  cartman helps his friends to save  from unknowingly marrying a  unfortunately he does not prove to be very useful because at the time he was recovering from laser corrective surgery for his eyes in  cartman helps kyle to save his brother  from his kindergarten teacher  whom ike was having an unhealthy sexual relationship with although cartman was doing it mainly because the two were making out in the school hallways while he was the hall monitor a job he took very seriously he proves extraordinarily helpful and kyle thanks him in  cartman angry at the other boys for missing his commercial debut kicks the star projector sending the full blast of the mind control machine into  brain saving the kids mr mackey and  from being put under mind control in  cartman repeatedly outsmarts injures and humiliates  until he is executed by a us soldier in  series cartmans secret identity is  former leader of a superherogroup  where he and the boys try to help people in trouble however he seems to merely use this for the fame that comes with it in  cartman told on the abusive foster parents to his councilor if he did not tell on the foster parents mysterion would not have been able to save  and the foster kids as easily   cartman wears a red jacket yellow mittens a blue hat with a yellow puff ball on top brown pants black shoes and white socks as  in  he sometimes wears a green tshirt with a bear picture on under his jacket a white tank top and occasionally a dark red tshirt he has mediumbrown hair and a doublechin he also has triangularshaped eyebrows in contrast to the other main boys rectangular ones even though cartman is overweight he always denies it especially in the earlier seasons by saying im not fat im just bigboned or some variation thereof however as  in  and  his weight problem may be in truth be genetic and runs in the family as  by the fact that with the exception of his mother an aunt and  his entire family is extremely overweight but in  when he tells his mother to talk about how he is big boned and such she instead says those were all lies sweetie youre just fat in  he is slightly thinner although in later s he was shown to have regained the lost weight cartman likely has blue irises as due to the events of  he has kennys eyes which were shown with blue in  in  he wears a tshirt with the words tokens life matters  in the future timeline set in  cartman is supposedly converted into judaism he wears a dark gray suit with black tie and white shirt along with a pair of round glasses his yarmulke resembles the blue hat with yellow puff that he wears in childhood    filethumbcartman uncapped in  cartman is described in various terms in short he is an evil vicious angry selfabsorbed immature destructive sarcastic snooty loudmouthed lazy and insane child he is the most foulmouthed character in the show he is also racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees the very dark usually disturbing undertones to his personality often hint at an extreme mental imbalance apart from being portrayed as having a general lack of moral responsibility or social conscience he also seems to take pleasure from others misfortune and is generally unable to show empathy although there have been exceptions such as in  despite the severity of his actions it is likely that they are a type of emotional defense mechanism against his insecurity and potential confused sexuality this defense however does not seem to be impenetrable as evidenced by  this has been parodied as well in the clich of a typical villain becoming benevolent in these s he usually convinces  that he has good intentions such as in the  twoparter where cartman  to kyle that he is concerned about peoples safety at the beginning but it is later shown to only have been doing it to get  off the air in the  and  twoparter kyle and many others fall for cartmans apparently good intentions for trying to prevent the children of  from going to hell however it is revealed that he only did it so he could earn money in  he is distraught at  impending death leading kyle to console him later when his supposedly real motives were revealed knowing how cartman typically is kyle promptly fights him in kennys defense although cartman was genuinely distraught over kennys illness before and after he learns that he can benefit from it this clearly shows that cartman went through congress for kenny and reveals that he does not have a healthy way of dealing with the death of his friend  cartman can on rare occasions show compassion towards cats as in  in which he hides cats in his attic from the authorities this compassion hints that he has not progressed to be a full sociopath  in  kyle sums up cartmans character as a fat racist selfcentered intolerant manipulative sociopath  filerightthumbcartman as a metrosexual in  he has been shown to harass and bully people at his school and as a result many people in the show despise him cartman however does not consider himself to be a bully who likes to pick on other people to pleasure himself in fact he seems to disregard good or bad altogether or perhaps simply does not have a concept of it and does whatever he feels necessary for him to get ahead cartman seems to be motivated not so much by personal gain as by asserting superiority over others in  he won  in a bet with kyle but instead of using the money he simply kept flaunting it in front of kyle until kyle conceded that cartman was right ruining his sense of victory and causing him to throw a tantrum and apparently even abandon the money and having it given back to kyle the same thing happens in  kyle makes a  bet that he can get a platinum album before cartman cartman makes a successful album and makes millions of dollars and earning the album but when cartman wins a myrrh album and discovers that the christian companies do not give out platinum albums  did not believe in such things the albums stem from the gifts of the three wise men they give out gold frankincense and myrrh albums thus meaning he cannot win the bet he angrily destroys the myrrh album showing that he did not care how he just made millions of dollars he just wanted to beat kyle in a bet  cartmans much quoted line respect my authority or as cartman pronounces it respect mah authoritah highlights his power hungry and dictatorial characteristics despite these traits cartman rarely commands respect from his peers cartmans friendships with the other kids are clearly existent but just not shown as much because of his personality  ironically despite or perhaps because of these qualities cartman also seems to be a natural leader able to utilize overwhelming charisma and rhetoric to gain the obedience of large groups on a moments notice as in  appearing to be innately aware of how to take advantage of mob mentality and direct it toward accomplishing his personal goals as has been evidenced in countless s throughout the series history in situations where the other boys share his goals cartman is often the de facto leader eg   and  indeed the others consistently show a willingness to follow him and trust in his leadership when he is using his abilities for good  cartman also seems to share many of the shows creators trey er and matt stone more controversial opinions despite both of them modeling stan and kyle after themselves examples of this include an extremely strong dislike for  for its lack of character development plot or smart humor other examples include cartmans strong distaste of hippies to the point that he has personally kept them out of   since he was  years old and his belittlement of the catholic church as extremist homophobic and a supporter of pedophiles in  he also considers john lennon to be the king of hippies   even though cartman is a child he discriminates against a lot of people in fact he is a racist sexist and specialist he hates african americans mexicans native americans aborigines and asians he is a racist because he thinks that minorities would take over the world someday as revealed in  and in  in first three seasons cartman did not show any racism but it soon developed after the events of  his discrimination lead to him becoming a bully on token black as he was african american his sexism is also  in the series as he hates girls too but that is because he is sexually confused he actually believes that girls and women are weaker than men and stupider too however he was proven wrong about that after he got beat up by  in  his sexism also made him turn his own mom into a personal slave who spoils eric with anything he wanted however she started to resist him in  cartmans speciesism is also  in the show and started to show it against his cat mr kitty cartman also has bigotry towards extraterrestrials and is extremely xenophobic but that is simply because some visitors placed an anal probe into him twice thus starting his speciesism however this kind of speciesism against alien races is very rarely  in the show    if you had a chance to go back in time right now and stop hitler wouldnt you do it i mean i personally wouldnt stop him because i think he was awesome but you would right  cartman in   cartman is extremely antisemitic and a great many of his bigoted actions are directed towards all jews and especially toward his jewish friend  whom he openly hates and considers subhuman because of his faith in the   after seeing the passion of the christ he believes the film was s way of rallying people against the jews and idolizes him for it he then dresses up as hitler and manipulates a group of people who think that they are simply raising awareness for the movie and christianity to join him in an antijew march while chanting in mispronounced  es ist zeit fr rache it is time for revenge and wir mssen die juden ausrotten we must exterminate the jews  when he tried to win the special olympics by feigning a disability in   kyle attempts to talk him out of it by telling him regardless of their differences that cartman will surely go to  for such an act cartman replies that kyle does not understand that hell is reserved for the jews indicating once again his selfrighteousness he also has been shown to consider judaism to be a disability and the title jew to be an insult he also believes jews to be incapable of many professions such as  rainforest shmainforestsingingrhythm   or even so much as  however on some occasions his accusations have been proven true particularly rhythm  in the   cartman dresses up as hitler for halloween a costume made by his mother even though cartman himself did not know who hitler was showing that his antisemitism may come from his mother in some part when shown a documentary to demonstrate why dressing like him is not cool cartman is enthralled and imagines himself being the one commanding the nazi troops in the video cartmans admiration for hitler is further emphasized in  after being offered  by kyle not to tease kyles cousin  since cartman has trouble restraining himself from teasing kyle schwartz about his jewish heritage since he is the stereotypical jew that kyle broflovski had been trying to avoid being for five years when  later tells kyle schwartz to concentrate cartman impulsively blurts out maybe we should send him to concentration camp  a contradiction of his idolization of adolf hitler is  in  where in this  cartman is incapable of pronouncing nazi correctly pronouncing it nayzee upon seeing it written as though he had never come upon the word before another contradiction occurs in  when cartman compares his mother who had been instructed how to treat her rampantly egocentric son by the dog whisperer with hitler as a reason why she should be killed although this is probably because cartman is not being allowed to indulge in his personal desires  in addition to taking regular jabs at racial ethnic and religious minorities as well as people of lower income like  cartman is also prejudicial against redhaired light skinned and freckled people which means that he is anti ginger this particular prejudice most probably originated from the notorious incident with  who had red hair and freckles although it may also be partially due to the fact that kyle has red hair and liane cartmans presumed prejudice against red haired people he believes that ginger kids are the most evil people in the world and that they have no souls which is clearly false during the   when the other three boys lead him to believe he has become a ginger himself in order to teach him a lesson he is horrified later he organizes a cult of homicidal ginger children bent on world conquest known as the  remarking im not going to live my life as a goddamn minority ironically cartman has an aunt who is redhaired an even bigger irony however would be when he later discover that he was indeed halfginger as his biological father  who was also father of scott tenorman was a ginger football player for the  this would technically make him a daywalker he does have the ginger gene cartman hates ginger kids a lot because he thinks that they would take over the world someday and are soulless cartman seems to ignore his half ginger heritage in later s simply because he is ashamed of it  cartman also may harbor some bigotry towards africanamericans he is never shown out right hating black people although he does believe in several stereotypes and is shown several times playing with  and seeking advice from  one of the few characters on the show cartman generally respected although cartman was in jail for his hate crime on token even though it is quite obvious he did not bash tokens head with a rock because he is black but because he thought token had insulted him it was in fact kyle who did this even though he usually rips on token for being black and he said he is gonna kill token someday   he does not seem to harbor negative feelings for black people and cartman always says he is going to kill people so saying he was going to kill token might not be personal in  when butters asks him what if he is not supposed to go to heaven but to heck cartman responds im not going to heck butters im not black all right this is strange because in  when kyle informs that cartman is going to cheat cartman responds to this by saying that hell is only reserved for jews but he did not include african americans into the mix   cartmans most passionate abhorrence is aimed at hippies though he seems to use this term for liberals in general in  he believes that hippies will destroy the town and while the rest of the townspeople are initially skeptical his fears are eventually borne out when too close to liberals he suffers what could be called an  he also wore a biosuit upon entering  in  his primary goal of that was because he needed someone to pick on he had started to pick on butters but butters just was not feeling it cartmans hatred of hippies and allergic reaction to liberals could mean that cartman is a conservative this means that cartman does support the republican party but he did not tantrum over any losses in presidential elections unlike  instead of throwing tantrums cartman burglarizes houses and steals property from liberals and conservatives as revealed in  when he broke into peoples houses and stole their tvs in order to make some cash while they were out getting drunk on the streets or had killed themselves he seems to have some liberal beliefs he never openly states that he is a republican but does say that democrats piss him off although he does not need to have any objection to them protesting in   cartmans bigotry and antisemitism seem to come in second next to his personal needs however despite his hate for the jews cartman saves kyle in the   because he can find no one else to pick on in  he is not above thanking kyle for stopping him from humiliating himself on national television also he saved the life of kyle who had been killed by  in  while this was seemingly because kyle would not be able to suck his balls if he died he was shown to cry and showed concern even before the military leader reminded him that at least now he does not have to suck anyones balls enraged cartman yells in despair no he has a strong heart he wants to live and began performing cpr on his dying friend   cartman is usually an orderly individual while his goals are chaotic in nature he obeys rules when they suit him even using order to manipulate other people he often idolizes people whom he feels share his various bigotries and aims by this reasoning he falls under neutral evil with no particular preference towards law or chaos as either one can be used to his advantage cartman is usually coldhearted and selfish but can be warmhearted and caring on a whim this sensitive and selfless side of cartman is often a superficial cover up for a selfish scheme he has in mind   it has been repeatedly shown that cartman has serious behavioral and emotional problems he has extremely exaggerated anger issues and violent tendencies when upset perhaps the best example of this is  in  when he had two people shot ground into chili and then fed to their distraught son causing a horrified kyle to say that he and stan should never piss off cartman again this has since been regarded as cartmans defining moment and has been brought up again countless times during the series   he also has displayed traits of gender confusion he occasionally has tea parties with stuffed dolls pretending they are talking about how cool he is owns a supposed female cat named  and in  he was  reenacting a scene from  as buffalo bill with a rag doll he named polly prissypants trapped down a well in  cartman goes on the maury povich show to be a panelist during a discussion on outofcontrol kids in an attempt to win the assumed prize he dresses up as a promiscuous teenage girl in the   butters reveals to the residents of   a video of cartman dressed as  while dancing around a cardboard cutout of justin timberlake which he apparently later made out with  cartmans confused sexuality is most apparent in the   in which cartman takes pictures of himself with butters penis in his mouth to make butters look gay however kyle stan and kenny explain that such actions actually make cartman look gay which results in cartman trying to get a picture taken of his own penis in butters mouth another moment of this apparent confusion can be  during the events of the  trilogy where he bet kyle that leprechauns were real and if he won kyle would have to suck his balls although cartman was proven to be right kyle refused causing cartman to become obsessed and began going to extreme lengths to force kyle to suck on his balls when  later questions his motive behind pursuing kyle to get him to suck his balls as being a little faggy he explains that it was all to humiliate kyle in  he unconsciously blurts out that he touched penises with his    ever since cartmans voice has changed he has a peculiar geographically indeterminable accent or possibly speech impediment with odd pronunciations of certain words and names which has shown to be a dominant trait in the extended cartman family aside from the sheer volume of expletives in his dialog he also uses words in different and often grammatically incorrect context some examples of this are instead of saying im serious he will say im seriously instead of saying here he will say heahre sometimes in the earlier s he would even pronounce here as myah apologized to wendy by saying he was very remoursefulness for his actions  and instead of saying respect my authority he would say respect mah authoritah this became a wellknown catchphrase of the show  kyle  kahl  kehal  kel  kyel kenny  keeny  kinny wendy  weendy  windy clyde  clay  clayed mom  meom  meem  mium cool  kewl school  schewl coon  cyoon  cyune my mah  miah  mio authority  authoritah here  hyah  in the   cartman was finally confronted by other characters about his mispronounciations when cartman says i beat you to it kyel kyle retorts my name is not kyel later on in the  after cartman screamed for his new foster mother  walked into the room replying with my name is not meem   a defining arc during the shows  was cartmans singleminded quest to make  million dollars the schemes he has tried include the tooth fairy tats becoming a part of the denver tooth racket and stealing tooth fairy money from kids  and  these all failed miserably for several reasons he also tried at it in the   when kyles kidneys were failing and cartman being the only one with kyles blood type demanded a payment of  million dollars when stan begged him to let kyle have his kidney he has also tried to  to the highestbidding stem cell research center and even to  as food in  cartman had also pretended he was retarded to compete in the special olympics and win  the reasons for this are never fully explained although in one   after inheriting a million dollars from his grandmother he reveals that he wishes to buy his own amusement  so he would not have to wait in lines for the rides he also stated that it has been his dream to own a million dollars since he was two years old in  he threatens kyle with a gun for his  in  cartman stumbles upon a pile of treasure while the boys are trapped in a system of caves afraid that the others might find the treasure and demand a share cartman decides to swallow as many of the coins and jewels as he can causing him to become extremely bloated and unable to walk or swim on his own later in the  it is revealed during the process of painfully crapping it out that the treasure is fake and used for photographs for tourists at the caves he is miserably and completely scrooged determined not to give up the slightest amount of money such as refusing to give a dollar to afghan children in  im not giving a dollar to those towelheads  observed in  that  was lucky cartman was only asking for half the money that would be made from patenting a joke that jimmy had come up with and cartman was intent on taking credit for he had actually lied on the couch eating chips offering no input   although cartman can at times be worldly he is often wildly misinformed he once believed that dolphins lived in igloos and mistook a canned food drive for when you cut open a chicks stomach and pull out the baby from inside and mistakes sexual harassment when youre having intercourse with a lady friend and someone tickles your balls from behind  cartman  to know very little about the female anatomy in  he threatened a woman with bitch ill twist your nuts off also in the   when he was told that his  sent him to s house so he would catch chickenpox he claimed that he would kick her square in the nuts in  he agreed with butters when he said to bebe oh yeah well at least we have assholes  in  he made a plan to steal a list the girls made of who the cutest boys in the class were the plan involved butters kicking one of the girls in the balls which failed of course forcing cartman and the rest of the boys to conclude that our mission failed but weve learned a lot primarily that girls do not have balls despite this in  he was shown to still not have learned this in  having  s vagina it is implied he still does not realize women do not have balls  in  cartman claimed he had hit puberty because he had his period when really he had an infection that made him bleed out his butt he did not realize that only girls got periods until  told him at the end of the   in  it is shown that cartmans idea of sexual intercourse is to stick it inside her and pee if you dont want to get her pregnant you pull it out and pee on her leg in the  cartman complains mom kittys being a dildo showing ignorance of the context in which dildo is used and possibly what a dildo is however it is possible he is using it as a generic insult such as calling someone a dick  also in  his ignorance is again displayed when he thinks all the minorities in his water  are what the mayans predicted and by  the apocalypse will be when the whole world is minorities  cartman also confuses english people with french people in the early seasons he often teased pip and called him a french piece of crap on the other extreme in the movie he called  a british piece of shit despite the mole being supposedly french additionally in  he alludes to despising austrians apparently failing to note the irony of the fact that he admires hitler who was austrian  it is also worth noting that cartman is completely oblivious to the fact the other kids hate him and often assumes they are joking when they imply or even openly declare it  in the   cartman completely ignores the fact that he got his own father killed and fed to his halfbrother and is more concerned about being halfginger  in  cartman is oblivious to the fact that his making another student crap herself is useless when trying to prevent the suicide of another student    cartman shows a pathological degree of impatience when forced to do something he does not want to do or when he has to wait for something he wants an example of the former is  in  in which cartman electrocutes himself in an attempt to create a flashback and avoid studying in the   where cartman freezes himself so that he would not have to wait three weeks for the  console to be released which shows irony in the end butters cannot find where cartman was frozen due to an avalanche and eric is thawed out almost  years in the future the people there zap him back to his own time where it turns out that he got sent back three months before the wiis release in  cartman is shown to be extremely agitated when he has waited to have  for too long and blurts out obscenities and shouting horrible things to his friends and to his mom liane cartman and when the kfcs get replaced with medicinal marijuana stores he goes to an addiction clinic to be prescribed with kfc gravy  although cartman frequently insults and taunts his friends he sometimes  to be more cowardly than they are when it comes to physical confrontation in  after cartman repeatedly threatens to beat kyle up if they do not get home in time for christmas kyle punches cartman and he immediately bursts into tears a similar instance can be  during  although kyle only punches cartman in the arm cartman may react like this to gain sympathy from other boys so he may turn the other boys against kyle showcased in  where he turned butters and a few other boys against kyle by exaggerating how kyle pushed him against a tree or he could just be cowardly it is unknown which it is likely the latter  at the end of  after cartman revealed his true motives for fighting to lift the ban on stem cell research to replicate a  and not to save kennys life kyle enraged about this brutally begins to beat up cartman delivering several blows to his chest and a good roundhouse right the beating continued on until the end of the  and has not been mentioned at all since although it shows kyle was able to beat cartman easily when angry  filethumbcartman and  engaged in a fight in  in  cartman threatens kyle and it leads to kyle giving cartman a bloody nose in  cartman is beaten up by  after provoking him with racial jibes in several s he is  able to overpower kenny but in some s he is not capable of doing so however in earlier s like  he is able to beat up kyle despite this kyle beat up cartman in the more recent  without hesitation  in  cartman has no problem with fighting the other boys back physically and it is revealed that sumo is his martial art of choice in  he smiles and sings the dawsons creek theme while he kills the official messenger boy with a piece of wood then drags the body offscreen although this happens in what was essentially a fantasy of cartmans and may therefore due to cartmans inflated ego not be representative of his actual abilities also in the   he and kyle have a slap fight which he won though this was more through deceit than skill and in the   he was dominant in a physical fight against a midget who supposedly had a black belt in karate also in  he threw a rock at token giving him a black eye  in  cartman is shown being physically abusive to innocent kids in the hallways he once pushes an unnamed kid up against a wall until the kid showed him his hall pass after which cartman acts as if nothing happened the kid questions cartman about his abuse of power and cartman promptly kicks him across the room in a somewhat cartoonish way although he is never shown pulling off a feat like that again  in  cartman is shown to be quite nervous over fighting  and is shown going to great lengths to avoid the confrontation however when wendy decides to fight him regardless he is quite spectacularly defeated overall cartman is a decent fighter although he can be a wuss and particularly enraged opponents can beat him with ease his specialty lies more with weapons than his fists  throughout all of these scenes it is heavily suggested that cartman indeed has a high tolerance for pain however will often feign pain to gain sympathy from those around him this shown especially in  where it was not until after kyle left did he start crying from being attacked by him and then later used it to convince other boys to lock him in a meat locker in  cartman as  beat up bradley and clyde after questioning his method of running coon and friends he also gives clyde a nasty cut after kicking him in the face showing his jumping abilities and the amount of force he can kick with   cartman has a disturbing habit of appearing in other peoples homes in the middle of the night he has a preoccupation with becoming mature or at least more so than his friends which frequently ends in him doing something that is anything but mature cartman also  to be driven by a desire to surpass kyle especially stan and kenny knowing that his satisfaction chiefly comes with seeing other people unhappy kyle once deliberately congratulated cartman on winning a bet this of course ruined cartmans egotistical satisfaction at having humiliated him  cartman also carries around what  to be a glock  pistol that has been  in several s he has actually never fired it and only uses it to threaten people he used it to persuade kyle into giving him his jew gold in  in  cartman used it to threaten the president of fox however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration his most recent use of it was when he and butters stormed a chinese restaurant and he orders butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders although cartman begins to regret giving butters the firearm because he keeps accidentally shooting men in the genitals  cartman apparently sees scenes of sickening andor disturbing imagery every time he closes his eyes but thinks nothing of it he also occasionally has milk come out of his nose when he laughs even when he was not drinking any this milksneezing problem is due to a malfunctioning kidney which cartman is tricked into donating for transplant benefiting his friend kyle who receives the malfunctioning organ as  in the   many of cartmans mannerisms were revealed to be inherited in  in which most of the cartman family were depicted in a similar manner   eric is quite possibly morbidly obese in  it is revealed that he is so unhealthy that he singlehandedly made the schools average on the presidential fitness test the lowest in the entire country despite the fact that all of the other students scored average on the test hiv in the first  of the twelfth season  it is revealed that cartman has in the past needed a routine tonsil checkup in this  however he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and his tonsils had to be removed in doing so they accidentally gave him hiv the virus that causes  he was angered by this and his anger worsened when kyle laughed  out of irony disbelief and thrill that something so horrible has happened to his worst enemy cartman with the help of butters then snuck into kyles room and intentionally gave kyle aids kyle figured it out and hunted cartman down and beat him up in the schoolyard and broke many of his toys including  cartman in the meantime researched the virus and found out that  had aids for decades and is still alive cartman and kyle then found out along with mr johnson that the actual cure for aids was heavy doses of cash the point being the solution to any problem is to throw lots and lots of coldhard cash at it cartman and kyle have both since recovered from the disease kyle still made it a point to break his xbox after they come back from new york and la curing aids  kyles mockery of cartmans infection with hiv is ironic since cartman has wished on many occasions in past s for kyle to have aids in  cartman kenny and stan are all playing video games when kyle enters and says that he has good news to which cartman hopefully replies you have aids in  cartman ends his fictional christmas story with the line and everyone lived happily ever afterexcept for kyle who died of aids two weeks later this similar closing line also used in the   in  cartman suggests giving kyle aids as a potential way to raise money in  while playing a board game cartman gives kyle an aids card giving him aids in the game stan then remarks to cartman dude thats not cool dont give kyle aids eyesight in the   it is revealed that cartmans eyesight is very bad after several unsuccessful attempts by the optician to cure them including a pupil dilation that resulted in him walking into several walls and a botched laser eye surgery that ended up with cartman having to wear bandages over his eyes for three days he managed to get a transplant from a donor whos head he had preserved in ice  the donor being  who cartman says had perfect sight mental health  however obesity hiv poor eyesight and bad tonsils may be the least of cartmans health concerns cartman seems to have a very poor mental health he shows signs of not only antisocial behavior but also sadism identity issues sexual confusion psychosis psychopathic nature and narcissism he apparently dreams of humiliating beating emotionally destroying or even killing kyle for example in  cartman dreams of taunting kyle i told ya so so much that the latter starts crying in  he seems to hope to kill kyle without any reason however it was not until the    incident that we see how deep his insanity goes when he creates a highly elaborate and sociopathy scheme resulting in murder and cannibalism in  he beats up a kid handcuffs him to the flagpole gives him a hacksaw poisons him and tells him the only way to get to the antidote was to saw off his leg this is similar to the saw movies  cartman also seems incapable to admit his own errors and history and instead alters past events in his own mind to show himself in a better light as  in  though so did everyone else and  cartmans mind even once backfired against him during  during which he made everyone believe he was suffering from  so as to be able to go around saying whatever horrible hateful thing he wanted without consequences unfortunate this resulted in him being completely unable to control what he said and began revealing assorted secrets such as him and his cousin touching penises cartmans sanity is called in to question with the existence of mitch connermitch connerjennifer lopez who is cartmans hand given a personalitybackstory in  cartman did ventriloquism with his hand claiming it thought itself to be a real person named mitch conner who was a conman posing as jennifer lopez cartman would often argue with the hand at length and the hand would apparently work independently of cartman such as masturbating  cartman would later claim it was just a prank on kyle and the others however in  cartman brings back mitch conner to swindle a group of celebrities and again proceeds to argue with his hand and disagreeing with it despite the fact there is no one around him to trick leading one to believe that cartman really believes the hand is a person the hand also claims to have knowledge that cartman does not such as who cartmans father really is in  it is revealed that cartman is s halfbrother meaning that he killed his own father  and fed it to scott tenorman in a bowl of chili however he was more concerned about being halfginger than the fact that he murdered his own father  in  it is revealed that cartman has an exceptionally tiny penis even for a boy of  years old and the insecurity of that seems to a leading or at least additional factor driving cartmans psychotic rages when the schools posts height measurements in the hallway for the boys cartman assumes it to be penis sizes and demands all the boys measure their sizes to disprove the original measurements his rage in this particularly incident leads him to getting anger management during which his doctor attempts to insult him to produce an angry reaction cartman oddly enough does not demonstrate his rage vocally in a coldly sadistic manner by manipulating the doctors wife into killing herself through a simple set of text messages cartman is then put in a group anger management session during which he several likeminded individuals with small penises go on a rage driven rampage  in  it  that cartman has multiple identity disorder as he  to have murdered his stuffed animals while having no memory of destroying them however it is implied that ventriloquism is used only when the toys speak and that they do indeed have a mind of their own for example cartman could not possibly have killed his stuffed animals while heading downstairs with token additionally it is also possible that peter panda was killed by the th graders cartman could be best described as having sadistic personality disorder with passiveaggressive traits also known as a tyrannical sadist  cartman often shows less interest in sexuality than the other boys this seems intentional on the writers parts and fits with his selfabsorption immaturity and gender confusion an example for this would be  in the   where the boys end up in an  and cartman only shows interest in the food rather than all the skimpilydressed waitresses the other boys however do show interest in them except stan who was too depressed at the time because  broke up with him  in   kisses cartman on the lips at the flag debate due to the fact she had a weird dream about him and started feeling attracted to him in the middle of the  however as soon as she was done kisses him she had no more feelings for him although at the end cartman walked away sad when she said they were friends again  cartman also displays a lack of knowledge about sex despite the fact that his mom is frequently having sexual relations with other people in   when  says that ike is too young to understand sex in the   cartman replies whats there to understand you get a boner slap her titties around some then stick it inside her and pee cartmans lack of knowledge is also displayed in the   when he tells  that sexual harassment is trying to have intercourse with a lady friend and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind however the other children except for kenny butters who explains sex in great depth to jimmy  but in a childlike sort of way and possibly clyde do not seem to have more knowledge of sex than cartman which is probably because they are only  years old  in  cartman makes a bet with  stating that if he can prove that leprechauns are real then kyle will suck his balls cartman wins the bet and his singleminded quest to force kyle to suck his balls subsequently becomes a significant subplot of the trilogy although he does not get kyle to suck his balls in reality he does imagine kyle sucking the balls of an imaginary cartman with much enthusiasm at the end of  it is quite plausible however to assume that cartmans obsession with his quest stems significantly from his desire to humiliate kyle rather than from any homosexual attraction to him  in  after listening to butters get beaten by his parents as cartman was responsible for it by pretending to be butters on the phone and insulting them cartman says if i were older i would totally start jacking off right now hinting at sexual sadism  in  when  tells cartman he is going to stop playing  cartman says that the french also stopped playing when hitler rose to power he then taunts  by asking him if he is french and then says voulezvous coucher avec moi clyde meaning do you want to sleep with me clyde in french although he could just be quoting the french lyric from the song lady marmalade without understanding the meaning but he could have been taunting him by saying he is french and using the french stereotype as a way to taunt him  in  cartman seeks to humiliate and degrade butters by taking a picture of himself with butters penis in his mouth after being told by kyle and stan that being photographed that way is humiliating him rather than butters in other words being photographed in such a way makes him gay cartman then seeks out butters to make him put his penis in butters mouth but this fails as the both of them are caught by   in  butters is putting on a condom when cartman is caught by kyle looking at butters penis cartman dismissively claims he was trying to see how to put on a condom which kyle does not believe  in  cartman once again finds himself the victim of getting an anal probe from aliens when chef and the boys take him to see a proctologist the doctor sticks his finger and his entire hand in cartmans rectum although initially surprised cartman lets out moans of pleasure just before a fiftyfoot satellite dish shoots out of his rectum although when the satellite retreats back into his rectum he experiences severe pain  however during the events of  cartman briefly became an object of affection for stans girlfriend  after being passionately kissed by wendy at the end of the  he is disappointed at the end when she says that she no longer has any feelings for him in  cartman along with stan kyle kenny and the entire third grade class were all attracted to the substitute teacher  although she was a lesbian and the boys did not understand what it meant they tried to become lesbians in order to try to win her additionally in  he accidentally admitted to having a crush on a girl named  and also said that he and his cousin touched wieners  in  he cross dresses as bad irene a woman who is addicted to abortions  in  cartmans uses his hand as a ventriloquist dummy who claims his hand is a conartist named  who is claiming to be  in order to try and trick the other boys into thinking that his hand might be truly sentient mitchjennifer and thus cartman pursues a relationship with  during which cartman proceeds to give ben multiple hand jobs one time even waking up in bed with a naked affleck his hand covered in affleck splooge while cartman claims this to be an act in the end these sexual actions seems to be unconsciously executed due to the fact that during or after cartman is both shocked and disgusted the fact cartman does this could indicate an unconscious sexual desire towards men ben affleck inparticular in this case cartmans extreme lengths to trick his friend despite them not being present to witness the hand jobs making the actions pointless in the grand scheme of things or that cartmans mitch conner is part of a psychological break resulting in a multiple personality  in  when the schools posts a list indicating the amount of height that the male students have grown over the past year cartman mistakenly assumes it to mean penis size and goes on a rampage decreeing the results to be incorrect due to the tiny size of his own he then proceeds to demand all the boys submit to new penis measurements which he personally administers with the exception of his own due to the fact he falsely claimed to have  inch penis during the process he compliments butters on his size  in  cartmans imaginary friend  debuts he can only be  by cartman himself which makes the other boys get confused in  he re and attempts to flirt with cartman but cartman denies he is gay cartman ends up on a date with him ending in anal sex which is mistaken by liane for masturbating  the   ends with cartman asking  what was at the bottom of a vagina and she responds by saying want me to show you to which he responds holy shit as the end credits begin   cartman has also had encounters with sexual abuse in  cartman mentions that his mom subjected him to humiliation in a sexual way he goes on about what he would do if a girl ever threatened to fight him but instead recounts one such incident  in  cartman is awoken by kyle stan and butters to help save some baby cows from slaughter as the other boys knock on his window cartman gives a scream of no uncle jesse no implying that one of his relatives may have abused him it could also mean he has a sexual fear of uncle jesse from the tv show full house  in  he receives a concussion that makes him think he is a vietnamese prostitute named ming li who frequently says fucky sucky five dolla a reference to stanley kubricks full metal jacket to passing male carnival goers he then services leonardo dicaprio much to his disgust after he reverts to his normal self  in  his attempt to find older friends winds up with him almost being molested by members of the   in  after discovering that semen will fertilize his seapeople he goes to a sperm bank to collect seamen at the sperm bank he pretends to test a semen sample by smearing it on his fingers when cartman later empties a bowl of semen into the tank he then tells stan and kyle that he got some of it from a man named ralph in an alley who told him to close his eyes and suck it out of a hose  in  a movie producer asks cartman who is disguised as a robot if he is a pleasure model cartman does not understand him until he takes his pants off at which point he runs out yelling in monotone fashion lame also in the   cartman convinces ben affleck among others that his left hand is an actual woman named jennifer lopez affleck later has a sexual encounter with miss lopez leaving cartmans hand covered with his semen  in  cartman was one of the various victims of  others being  and  ironically after having attacked  throughout most of the  due to his being conceived in new jersey as well as being ginger and jewish kyle is the one who saves cartman from this encounter   in  cartman converted to  along with most of the residents in   when it is revealed that all the blaintologists are to commit mass suicide in washington dc to further their cause cartman becomes overjoyed even turning on kyle who did not agree in such an act  in the future timeline set in  he has converted to judaism and becomes a rabbi and has a jewish wife with three children all of which was met with skeptism from kyle   the most active family member in cartmans life is his mother  a recurring joke throughout the series is that despite his mothers sweetness and wholesome demeanor she is in fact a promiscuous oversexed cracksmoking scheieporn queen prostitute and nymphomaniac many of these aspects of lianes personal life are a constant source of annoyance for cartman whose friends often mock him over and which he attempts to fruitlessly deny an example being when stan and kyle continuously stated she was on the cover of crackwhore magazine in  cartman attempted to deny this fact until presented with the magazine itself he then stated that she had been young and needed the money which unfortunately did not work as stan and kyle pointed out that the pictures had been taken just a month ago liane constantly dotes over cartman doing almost anything he asks and at times even agreeing to his most horrible ideas and plans such as signing him up for the special olympics in  the fact liane allows cartman to bully and control her is apparently due to extreme loneliness brought up by not have a serious romantic partner and also apparently not having any close friends she thus desires that cartman be her friend and will do anything to keep him happy this unfortunately could explain much of his behavior it has been implied at least in earlier s that liane may be responsible for much of cartmans racism antisemitism and homophobia as he often was to quote disparaging things that he had supposedly heard her say for the most part it seemed that cartman was perhaps lying or misquoting his mother except for in  in which liane made cartman an adolf hitler halloween costume despite cartman not knowing who that was at the time  for over twelve seasons since  cartman lived under the belief that his mother was a hermaphrodite and also his biological father in  however cartmans handpuppet  reveals that what cartman was told was a lie and that liane was not cartmans father after demanding answers out of  and  it is revealed that the paternity tests were altered and one of the people in the room at the time of revelation was indeed cartmans father in  it is revealed that cartmans father is actually  a  haired member of the  and father of cartmans archrival  apparently during the night of the drunk barn dance liane proceeded to have sex with assorted men and women however jack was the one who impregnated her cartman unfortunately never got to meet his father properly due to the fact that during his war against his halfbrother scott in which scott sold eric his pubes stating it would allow him to reach maturity cartman killed both jack and his wife ground their bodies up into ground meat cooked it in chili and proceeded to feed it to scott cartman does not regret killing his father however instead is horrified to know that he is halfginger and thus carries the ginger gene in his body he was however happy when reminded that his father was actually a denver bronco  cartmans extended family is shown in the   where he and the others go on a trip to nebraska to visit them for christmas most of his relatives appear to be similar in manner to him all fat with the same speech accent and catchphrases the family is  again in the   at his grandmothers funeral where she leaves her estate valued at  to eric citing that all the other family members would have spent it all on crack  in the   cartman was shown to have a father and sister but these characters were cut out in the official pilot in  he accidentally revealed that he cries at night because he does not have a real father  he has some dutch and irish descent as in  he mentions that his grandmother mabel is dutchirish    liane dotes on her son endlessly beyond simply spoiling him cartman usually gets whatever he wants simply by whining in his signature style he also frequently insults her in her presence which she accepts without question although liane possesses a social and moral conscience cartman is usually able to manipulate her into doing even morally reprehensible things for him in  cartman is able to have his mother sign him up for the special olympics even though cartman was not disabled it  that liane is convinced of her sons goodness and accepts any excuses or stories he makes up no matter how improbable the relationship between the two shows a significant change in  to manage cartmans behavioral issues she hires  cesars methods work and cartman becomes a normal good natured well behaved boy liane tries to form a relationship with cesar but he turns her down as she is just a client and she soon begins to spoil cartman againas this boy is the closest thing to a friend she really has however liane seems to be one of the only humans whom cartman genuinely cares about it was only his muchrepressed conscience that kept him from killing her in the same  she does not mind doing stuff that is completely gross as  in  when she takes a bedpan down to the basement where the boys are playing warcraft and lets cartman crap into the bedpan that she is holding in the later seasons she has been shown to be strict with him as  in   and  all of which show her not only following through with punishments but also showing obvious disgust with cartmans behaviour still despite her taking a more firm stance with cartman liane will still often spoil him due in large to part to preemptively avoid his tantrums as  in   cartman places his mother second on his shit list  in  with kyle as first on the list this implies he has a strong hatred for her however he is defensive of her whenever her promiscuous nature comes into question during earlier seasons as well as being disturbed during  to discover she was a star in a german pornographic video with this factored against his outrageous acts against her it can be  that he has a strong loathing of her and yet has some form of caring about her at the same time   filethumbcartman having a tea party with his dolls in  cartman has a cat named  and a potbellied pig named  mr kitty and fluffy have never been  together in the series thus far he also has a stuffed frog toy named  other beloved stuffed animals include wellington bear a take on paddington bear polly prissypants the rag doll purple lizard rumpertumskin a take on rumpelstiltskin and peter panda cartman nearly always plays with these toys by himself perhaps out of embarrassment or just as likely meanspiritedness occasionally others are allowed to play with him such as  in  cartmans games with these toys can demonstrate his vindictive and cruel nature one of his games as  in aforementioned  is lambs in which cartman reenacts scenes from the silence of the lambs with his dolls such as placing a doll in a pit in his basement and then voicing the doll begging to be released while the doll holding it prisoner threatens the pitbound doll often cartmans games involve the toys telling him how cool and smart he is and he directs towards them an affection which is not  towards any other person except his mom oddly enough during one incident in which cartmans toys were praising him one of the toys called him a fat piece of crap which was a surprise to cartman himself considering cartman was voicing the toys this could imply that a small part of a cartman despises himself and that the insult was a subconscious slip in  when a group leaves to conduct a rescue mission all the group members say goodbye to a person close to each of them except cartman who bids farewell to clyde frog  cartman i dont want you to worry about me clyde frog clyde frog just sits there cartman hey youre the best stuffed animal i ever had  in the    although cartman had given kyle aids as punishment for kyle laughing at him for having hiv kyle angrily breaks many of cartmans toys in reaction among these toys he rips off clyde frogs head in  clyde frog is  on the chalkboard in cartmans morning announcements implying that cartman has fixed him  in  someone begins destroying cartmans toys after he was told to grow up he is  with a new toy muscleman marc clyde frog is stabbed and nailed to a tree with the word vengeance underneath then peter panda is set on fire while cartman was asleep which burns his room later cartman takes them to tokens house convinced that black people are incapable of doing anything wrong the toys soon disappear leading cartman to find muscleman marc inside a pot of boiling water and rumpertumskin chained with a bomb collar which cartman inadvertally sets off blowing its head off cartman finds polly prissypants in a chair with a revolver the act is dropped when we see cartman voicing polly as she confesses to the murders claiming that the others were right that cartman had to grow up so she killed the other toys and planned on framing token but cartman reminds her that because of obama black people cannot be blamed in desperation polly asks cartman to kill her which he reluctantly does the other boys watched and realized that this was cartmans delusional way of getting rid of his stuffed animals cats cartman though incapable of empathy towards people exhibits a strong bond with cats despite being a speciesist in  cats are made illegal because kenny along with several other kids around the country begins using male cat musk as a hallucinogenic drug cartman lies to the police claiming that he had his cat put down when he really is hiding his cat in the attic throughout the  he collects abandoned cats in his attic out of sympathy his cat has been on the show since the series began and his love for cats could have developed from his lack of other family members besides his mother he has no father or siblings this empathetic relationship is reserved for cats and not humans he does not or more likely chooses not to recognize a parallel between his cat safehaven to the history of jews hiding from nazi soldiers during the holocaust which kyle points out     the rivalry between cartman and kyle has been a recurring theme from the beginning but has become significantly stronger since  cartman  to have a very strong hatred for kyle and shows that he has no tolerance for kyles jewish faith kyle hates him in turn however neither one of them seems to realize the effects of their almost poisonous relationship and continue to live in close contact with each other  in  cartman and kyles relationship meets a turning point going from a relationship of them simply ripping on each other constantly to near hatred simply because cartman  it was around  that they began their descent from lovehate to full on hatred  however in the  during the scene where cartman has butters apologize to all of his peers in his stead as he believes he is a ghost he seems to wish to recant some of his earlier misdeeds towards kyle and obtain his forgiveness and seems genuinely moved upon seeing him  kyle is often put in the shoes of the protagonist to eric cartmans antagonist for example in  the two of them work against each other when cartman tries to get  canceled kyle tries to stop him the two of them often have arguments about morals like in  where cartman decides to pretend to be mentally handicapped so he can win the special olympics  in  when they were facing certain death cartman tried to atone for all the times he called kyle a big dumb jew telling him i didnt mean it youre not a jew bewildered kyle replies that he is indeed a jew and cartman tells him not to be so hard on himself implying that jew was an insult rather than a religion  cartman also has attempted to murder kyle more than once the most significant incident being in a scene from  in which he lures kyle into going rowing with him to the middle of  and then when kyles back is turned attempts to bludgeon him to death with a wiffle bat without comprehending the stupidity of the plan when he learns someone has confessed to the crime he kyle stan and kenny had committed thus eliminating the need to kill kyle who was going to confess himself cartman asks stan in his usual trademarkpathetic way if he can still kill kyle cartman tries to murder kyle again in   however in  cartman saves kyle and his family when a large storm is about to go towards their house in san francisco cartman finds butters as too boring a nemesis since he will simply accept anything cartman directs at him and realizes that in order to have someone with which to argue incessantly again he must get kyle back at the end of the  he hides the fact that he was the savior of kyles whole family opting to insult kyle again instead kyle replies angrily and storms off to cartmans satisfaction in the   when kyle unintentionally saves cartman from shouting out all his secrets on dateline cartman had originally intended to use fake tourettes so as to deliver a hatespeech against jews cartman hugs kyle and thanks him even saying i love you man in the   when kyle falls into a cavern and asks from the bottom is cartman there he responds with a sincere im here kyle of course this only occurs after cartman suggests they leave kyle for dead and continue to their search for crocodiles in the   cartman defends kyle saying broflovskis a good cop  cartmans obsessive hatred of kyle above almost all others has called into question cartmans deeper feeling for kyle in the   cartman wins a bet with kyle which requires kyle to suck his balls and goes to various extreme measures throughout the imaginationland trilogy to make kyle do so including going to the supreme court and breaking into the pentagon twice in the end of the trilogys first part cartman is  with a photo of an innocent looking kyle the scene ends with cartman dragging his finger slowly across kyles mouth in the photo which could be interpreted as an act of lust this further hints at a confused sexuality at the end of the trilogys third part cartman conjures up an imaginary kyle to suck the balls of an imaginary cartman  cartman also in the   offers to suck kyles balls after kyle said suck my balls cartman in exchange for kyles help in getting cartman back from the distant future in the   kyle encourages cartman to run away to  hoping that he will die cartman also seems to have no qualms about seriously invading kyles personal space as shown in a scene from  wherein cartman while contemplating his hatred for kyle looms a mere inch or two from kyles face as he sleeps soon kyle wakes up and yells dude get away from me  however the fact that kyle challenges cartman more than any other character in the series may in fact be the core reason for cartmans obsessive fixation on him in  he says that kyle has finally come to terms with his disability and seemed more willing to kill kyle later in the  by making his walk the plank over an alligator as of  he seems to be more passive toward kyle greeting him with only  sup jew this passive attitude however seemed to be only temporary as  in  in which during s intervention on national tv each of the boys is asked to read a prewritten statement about their feelings for towelie cartman however instead reads off a longwinded hate speech against the jewish people most likely the one he intended to use during  where he urges the rest of the country to help him in rising up against the jews and in which most of his speech is directed primarily towards kyle  the two have occasionally gotten along such as in  and  when kyle put his hand on cartmans shoulder when was upset about kenny dying in fact in  cartman helped kyle make new friends even though cartman did not appear to be gaining anything out of it in  kyle was ironically the one who saved cartman when he was being raped by  cartman showed genuine appreciation for this act thanking him and later going as far as to say that although kyle was a monster for having jersey blood running through his veins he was my cartmans little monster and pinched his cheek although they bicker constantly the two have not full on fought since then and have had a lot more moments together where they seem happy such as kyle sharing music with cartman in  there are also moments such as in  where the two share a common goal however there are many moments where they are at ends like earlier in the series such as in the coon trilogy therefore their friendship is in a constant state of disrepair  the backandforth of their outward conflict yet still regularly meeting with the other boys can be  as somewhat ironic therefore kyle and cartman could be  to have a more complex connection than stan and kyle with  in  kyle described cartman as my sort of friendish as his best explanation of their relationship  in  stans behavior change upon turning  causes a rift to develop occurs in his friendships with kyle cartman and kenny to the point where they no longer wish to interact with him as a result at the s end with cartman and kyle playing video games together the pair offer each other kind smiles showing their friendship growing even further  in  kyle and cartman have quite a few friendly moments together although they are shown bickering the argument is not angry as most of the arguments between the two can be kyle is quick to support cartman in his new business even going so far as to tell stan that they ca not be friends anymore because he is with cartman burgers now when stan shows up drunk talking to kyle it is shown that cartman is keeping a close eye on them from where he was standing he even eventually comes over to check if kyle is okay giving stan a distasteful look however this is rapidly tarnished by the s end when kyle discovers his method for producing his burgers  in  cartman constantly rips on jews throughout the  even to the point of making up a jewish creatures that eats children in easter egg hunts when cartman believes that the creature could be real and is chained so the creature can eat him he is tranquilized and is hazed kyle finds him and takes him home and puts him to bed the next day at the  easter egg hunt cartman claims that he is jewish and knows how kyle feels    cartman and stans friendship is clearly existent but it is very tense in fact when kyle and kenny are not around he and stan often do not show a close friendship with each other or rarely interact oneonone  in  stan and cartman hang out at the boating rack and cartman even comments that it is great that they are hanging out with each other without kyle to which stan does not disagree to implying that stan somewhat shares these feelings stan also agrees with cartman in the  such as not telling kyle he caused the dam to break and not telling  he was the one who broke the dam  cartmans song  was joined by all the other classmates minus kyle of course even getting stans attention in which stan actually enjoys the song  in  while kyle is immediately distrustful of cartmans claim that he cannot control the actions of his hand which has seemed to take on a life of its own stan gives cartman the benefit of the doubt and admits that with all the stuff that happens in  cartman could be telling the truth cartman and stan were also  interacting one on one in  when kyle kenny and butters were away at the karne institute for sex addicts and they were playing with each other on the domestic violencegolf video game  at cartmans house and they were getting along just fine with no arguments when the boys were playing street hockey in  stan was the only one he did not insult referring to him as marsh as any commentator would as opposed to kyle and kenny who he referred to as the jew and the poor kid respectively  in  cartman made stan the protagonist of his christmas story he is described as the boy in a red poofball hat everyone but kyle likes the story including stan the fact that stan is portrayed normally in the christmas story hints that stan is cartmans friend unlike kyle who is portrayed as evil in  stan votes for cartmans mascot instead of kyles much to kyles dismay also in the   when stan  to be the only boy who has not gotten their period cartman reassures him that he will get it one day however in  cartman declares that he hates stan because stan loves animals even so in the   all three boys defriend stan after he becomes the leader of scientology as the boys leave cartman turns to stan and says i still hate kyle more than you in  when cartman was negotiating for weapons and an escape route for him and the rest of the boys he is at first reluctant to meet the demands of  but soon agreed to his conditions when he looked at stan and recognized the sores which were actually minivaginas on his body and his deteriorating health this implies that cartman cares about stans wellbeing to an extent another reference to their friendship is in  when cartman notices that kyle stan butters and jimmy are still alive he instantly hugs stan running past kyle  in some s stan is shown having a strong hatred for cartman even if cartman is not doing anything in  when the cyborg says he has to kill cartman stan asks if he can do it and prepares to shoot cartman before the cyborg decides against the idea in  stan is fully for sending cartman away forever although stan is much more tolerant of cartman than kyle is he often holds cartman in very high contempt for his unacceptable behaviour in  when mr mackey claimed that cartman killed himself for being fat when the school faculty threw him under the bus stan was only concerned with preventing eavesdropper from publishing the biggest story  in  cartman ends his friendship with stan rather quickly after stans personality change and soon begins getting along better kyle who also ends his friendship with stan though they did become friends again in     because of cartmans selfish personality his friendship with kenny is not as obvious as stan and kyles and it sometimes looks fake but it is clearly existent they are also shown to share a sense of humor as can be  in the   when kenny and cartman continue an elaborate joke despite stan and kyles objections  however cartman has at times displayed a special dislike for kenny often without any reason most often he shows contempt for kennys family living in poverty in two separate s  and  cartman is heard singing the song  in order to tease kenny in  kenny and cartman are alone in the scene and cartman blurts out i hate you kenny out of nowhere in the   cartman makes up a song called i hate you guys where he sings i hate you guys  you guys are assholes  especially kenny  i hate him the most in the   he attempts make kenny a scapegoat for his lice problem not realizing everyone had lice and upon proving kennys guilt with an elaborate phony experiment cartman then organizes a cruel sock bath hazing ritual for kenny  continuing with it even after  reveals that everyone had lice in the earlier seasons kenny was often painted as cartmans much abused sidekick although this role has been filled by butters since   it is possible that kenny is cartmans only real friend and he does not understand how to react to having such a friend or the opposite since stan and kyle at some points have stated that kenny is not really their friend and that they do not give a crap about him although this is usually whenever they want to avoid him for some reason such as  in the   cartman proclaims that kenny is his best friend among the three boys but at the end of the  it is implied that cartman is kennys worst friend since he exploited kennys illness for personal gain however he had cried over kennys illness before discovering the possibility of making his own shakeys  kenny has generally taken cartmans side in arguments or when they do things cartman is also the only person who seems to take kennys deaths seriously in the    when he cannot see kenny who was crushed seconds earlier he calls out guys is kenny okay showing that he might consider kenny a close friend cartman is also the only person who seems to realize he dies more than once in  cartman says he dies all the time and brushes his death off easily because he will come back tomorrow in  cartman is telling a story and has kenny dying at the end even though kenny had died minutes before by being eaten by the giant black monster outside the bus kyle points out to him that kenny dying twice would be impossible and cartman goes along with it noticing the logic this may show that cartman is immune to whatever keeps everyone else blinded by the fact that kenny repeatedly dies  in the   kenny states in his will that he felt sorry for cartman because of his inability to feel compassion and empathy and the fact that he will almost certainly end up bitter miserable and alone for the rest of his life also in the   the two are shown playing with spaceships without stan or kyle although kyle was dying at the time and in the   when cartman drinks kennys ashes mistaking them for chocolate milk leaving kennys soul trapped in his body until the   kenny also chooses to appear to cartman as opposed to stan or kyle in  although this might be because it was cartmans fault he died however he was actually trying to warn and have him tell everyone about  and  plan for world domination in  cartman is shown to be aware of kennys deaths telling the irs that kenny dies all the time kenny was the only one out of the four main boys excluding  to enter his theme  as well as the only one offered a spot in cartmans ern army at the end of the   cartman was the only one sobbing over kennys death in fact cartman even showed a little concern for kenny when he found out his new girlfriend was a whore in  in the   after kenny has a seizure and is rendered unresponsive after playing the chinpokomon video game cartman was the only one of the three who seemed to notice that rats were swarming over kenny and attempting to eat him and the only one to detach them telling them bad rats he isnt dead yet and unlike stan and kyle who immediately laughed he was initially disgusted when it was discovered the rats had actually eaten him from the inside out before proceeding to laugh also in the   he noticed that kenny was eating his own hand out of boredom whilst he did nothing he still mentioned it to the boys as if to say should we help him kenny also aided cartman in his escape when cartman was charged with hate crimes  however ever since cartman unwittingly made kenny cry in  their friendship has not been as strong  even after everyone stopped giving cartman the silent treatment their friendship did not fully recover in particular in the   kenny is shown to value  more than his friendship with cartman who was ruining nascars image kenny even went as far as to try to kill cartman with a sniper rifle but this was confiscated eventually when he lost the race to  cartman apologized to him for his behavior  a rare event indeed  and kenny most likely forgave cartman later in  cartman used his new friend the dark god  to banish kenny along with several others to an evil and parallel dimension when kenny caught up with cartman  who was in the process of massacring a  concert  cartman showed no remorse and the two ended up in a heated argument  however in  cartman and kenny are getting along fine once again and spend that  being friendly and hanging out with each other in  there is a picture of cartman and kenny sitting next to each other at  even though cartman slams down the photo because kenny betrayed him by switching to playstation  instead of sticking with xbox  kenny does not take part in smashing erics electronics in    filethumbleftcartman and butters suffer great injuries together during  butters has become cartmans most frequent victim butters sees cartman as his good friend and treats him as so but in later s he treats cartman the same as everybody else but cartman takes advantage of this and finds butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view or get him to do what he wants in  cartman easily gets butters to vote for his idea of a turd sandwich simply by describing the candidates in a certain way in  he gets butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the wii video game console  in many s entire plots are centered on cartmans antics against butters in  cartman faked an apocalypse so butters would hide in a bomb shelter for over a week so cartman could go with kyle stan and kenny to casa bonita instead of butters in  he dressed as a robot to trick butters but in the end this failed miserably and butters happily showed a tape of cartman dressed like britney spears in front of everyone for revenge in the   butters does another one at cartman while he is beaten down by token by farting on his face giving him the finger while saying fuck you eric for his repeated blasphemy and ruining their band he also taunts cartman for being the real ugliest kid in their class and mocks his neonazism in a deleted scene in the    in  all of the kids at  decide to ignore cartman because they feel he is a son of a bitch unlike the other boys butters is not aware of the plan and cartman believes that butters is the only one who can see him now that he is dead in  he repeatedly invited butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him until it backfired on him and he made an inappropriate picture which featured him putting butters penis in his mouth and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class humiliating cartman instead of butters in the   after cartman gets brutalized by  butters agreed with  that he always hated cartman with everyone else however  cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards butters after he is queefed upon and even gives him a present as well as participating in a statewide attempt to ban queefing with butters as a mascot suggesting some compassion for butters although he like the others refuses to go near butters after he was queefed on cartman also punishes butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl in  though later he would praise butters for kissing a girl for  bucks in the   when everybody is rescued butters is disappointed that cartman did not die  cartman has the tendency to pull pranks on butters while he is asleep this is most apparent in  and  one of which is to place a warm glass of water under butters hand and then urinate on him also in  while  got grounded by his parents cartman decided to cover for butters while stan and kyle tried to get  million dollars when butters parents told him they would call him on the phone every hour   in  cartman was assigned and paired up with heidi to take of an egg for a school assignment later when cartman broke the egg he begged  to give her an a and give him an f this could possibly prove that cartman cares and has feelings for her however in later s it does not show much of them having a relationship it is also likely that he said this to get a better grade because the a and f average out to a c whereas two fs would mean cartman failed  in  heidi turner and cartman form a relationship when she gives him a glimpse of life outside social media following that in  it is revealed by cartman the two are now a couple and he claims to be wiser from the experience  in  they both work together to help denmark put an end to internet trolling they even sing  in a vain attempt to unify the boys and girls at   in  cartman is unable to tell heidi about his past bigotry out of fear of being dumped he lies to her and blames the incidents on  in order to further prevent the truth from coming out the two journey to  in  to get to    focused on her emoji analysis in  heidi begins to focus more on her work rather than cartman cartman laments to butters about this who tries to convince him that heidi will leave poop on his heart  at the end of  in  heidi and eric stay together although eric is disappointed in her  in the  premiere   their relationship becomes stained cartman begins to be annoyed with heidi for not being submissive to him he blames her for his unhappiness in their relationship accusing her of being mentally abusive at the end of the  cartman breaks up with heidi and leaves her heartbroken despite this it is revealed in the following   that cartman truly does love heidi as he leaves heidi a voicemail threatening her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back worried about him heidi accepts this and they get back together  the toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the    in the  cartman grows frustrated with heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together instead of telling her how he felt he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt hed feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her  reprimands cartman for this saying that heidi is a nice girl and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly cartman dismisses this and later he convinces heidi to dress up as gretel while dressing himself up as hansel immediately after he takes heidi into the woods with him at night and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die and gets her kidnapped by a witch she is rescued at the end of the  much to cartmans dismay  their relationship plays its most significant role to date in the seventh  of season twentyone it was revealed in the  doubling down that heidi tolerates cartmans abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend these feelings are directly influenced by the other girls who laugh at her and tease her for ever dating him albeit playfully they also expressed concern for heidis sanity and her safety while in her relationship with cartman all holding a personal vendetta against him kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself the girls assume that kyle has feelings for heidi leading kyle to question his relationship with her and he soon develops an interest in her after breaking up with cartman heidi agrees to be kyles girlfriend angering cartman cartman recognizes heidis confusion about what she wants and uses this to manipulate her into betraying her healthy diet and contort her beliefs making her unintentionally prejudice against jews   cartman is known to taunt wendy for her liberal and environmentalist views and often refers to her as a hippie or a tree hugger however in  after they were working together on the flag debate he entertained her by talking through two action figures during this encounter they found out that they had a lot in common with each other when wendy kissed him at the presentation to get her emotions out of her system he was pleased and facially bragged to stan about it he later seemed dejected when wendy told him her feelings for him were gone which obviously proved he fancied her it is believed his taunting of her is his way of pulling pigtails   in  after wendy grows adultsized breasts cartman and the other boys laugh at her and cartman calls her a stupid bitch  in the   cartman treats wendys plea for breast cancer awareness as a joke and subsequently she beats him up leaving him in a pool of his own blood  despite this cartman may still have a sexual attraction to wendy  in cartmans inaccurate flashbacks and imaginations in  when cartman killed a dragon and saved   from the jewbots as wendy showers him in praise as he basks in it  cartman seems to grow more hate and always assaults wendy when he gets any chance in  as he may still hold a grudge against wendy after being beaten up by her in    cartman is the only one to say greet wendy in  when she meets up with the others to go trickortreating and says it in a nice tone however cartman could have liked the fact that wendy humiliated stan  in  cartman says that wendy has huge boobs this could be him trying to impress her by saying she looks attractive also this is one  after  which is when wendy kissed cartman implying that cartman still likes wendy  wendy and cartman have both killed people and both have made psychotic and sadistic faces and actions in  wendy watches  get rocketed into the sun and says in a sweet creepy voice bye  bye ms ellen then puts then on a smiling psychoeyed face saying dont fuck with wendy testaburger in  cartman had informed scott tenorman of his parents death with a smile and a creepy voice he also taunts him saying na na na na na na i made you eat your parents na na na na na na cartman then licks scotts tears saying let me lick your tears scott mmm theyre so yummy and sweet the tears of unfathomable sadness mmm yummy yummy you guys this shows that the two are alike in mental health homicidal and sadistic which could be something for them to bond over  in  wendy uses the transgender bathroom to get back at him    although cartman does not generally like anyone in particular he was very fond of chef as  in  where cartman was crying in front of butters and even admitted that he was going to miss chef but did not know how to tell him he normally used to go to chef with his problems and chef was always willing to help him chef even helped cartman get kennys soul out of his body before it killed him  however when cartman was creating a crew to free the town from the hippies he chose chef as the black man to sacrifice himself later it should be noted that before cartman found out that liane was his father he had been told that chef was his father and despite chefs willingness to help cartman he like everyone else in town is more than willing to insult cartman and call him fat   throughout the series cartman shows a special dislike for craig he usually tries to prove craig wrong and annoy him in many s craig competes against cartman and shows satisfaction when he has advantages this can be   or  where cartman declares wrathfully god i hate craig that son of a bitch in another  cartman tries to go to craig when runs from home but craig tells him he hates him and shuts the door in his face however whenever all the boys join forces for a common cause such as in   or  craig is usually cartmans righthand man in  cartman trained craig in sumo wrestling in  cartman is the most excited in showing off their weapons to craig in skank hunt he along with stan kyle butters clyde jimmy and token smash cartmans electronics due to them thinking that he is skankhunt   ever since  clyde seems to show great respect for cartman since he went through everyone calling him a fat ass everyone seems to be shocked whenever clyde stands up for cartman especially cartman one example was in  clyde joined cartmans pirate crew in  he is also always in cartmans groups whenever cartman assembles a group against other enemies in  he invited cartman to participate in his birthday party at casa bonita after watching the  commercial in the   he immediately calls clyde and goes to his house to watch it again furthermore in  cartman encourages people to add clyde as a friend on  however in  clyde is reluctant to join the cartmanled attack on the  and ultimately noshows as he is more preoccupied looking at a playboy centerfold than playing the game cartman also once slingshotted clyde in the balls for his own and as he later defended his actions in  s amusement in  clyde joins stan kyle butters jimmy craig and token to smash all of cartmans electronics due them think that he is   it  that cartman has a strong hatred for clyde as shown by his shit list in  where he placed clyde rd for his most hated person after kyle and liane cartman respectively  cartman has a mixed relationship with token black although it is mostly negative displayed by his use of stereotypes and general reoccurring meanness to him token really hates cartman because he is generally racist toward numerous minority groups including black people in  when token constantly mocks cartman about his weight and kyle after provokes him cartman throws a rock token however after being released from prison and after winning the race against the girls cartman vows to never take his friends for granted again much to tokens delight who starts to warm up to him in  cartman makes fun of him because he is rich and wealthy in  cartman got beat up by token after he wasted money that they made and scared their crowd away he also racially insinuated that token could play bass guitar on the grounds that he was black which turned out to be true him butters and token have their own album  in  cartman remorsefully apologizes to token for ripping on him for being black thinking that he was a ghost and does not realize that he was being ignored at the time in  cartman hides in tokens house thinking that he will be safe from any assaults because token is black in  cartman repeatedly worked to ensure that token and  became a couple on the grounds that in his words blacks belong together in  he joins stan kyle butters token jimmy craig and clyde to smash eric cartmans electronics  wendys best friend bebe often shows hatred for cartman as he does for her in  bebe tells stan that wendy wants to break up with stan leading to a heated argument between cartman and bebe cartman calls bebe a whore numerous times to which bebe calls cartman a fat ass in  at the beginning of the  all of the kids are  playing call of duty world at war cartman is shot and killed by someone within the game and he says ah who just shot me and bebe leans away from her computer and flips cartman off saying that she killed him within the game when cartmans character respawns he immediately attacks bebe and refers to her as a bitch also in  when bebe refused to give him the list cartman says fuck you bebe fucking bitch he also disagress with bebe about farts in  in  cartman role plays  with his dolls with bebe the two get on well together although this was only due to her breasts   in  when cartmans fake tourettes become real he reveals to everyone that he is in love with patty nelson and that he fantasizes kissing her upon hearing this however patty nelson looks horrified as she mutters eww  jimmy is one of the kids that cartman have manipulated sometimes and sometimes becomes his rival in  however jimmy seems to be one of the few people that cartman respects and is willing to do good deeds for as shown in many s he enjoys jimmys comedy and often goes to him whenever he needs advice he was even willing to sacrifice himself to save jimmy in  even though this was because cartman believed he wrote jimmys joke and was in a way trying to take credit the fact that he was willing to sacrifice himself to  to save jimmy this is still very noteworthy as one of the few times cartman did a good deed without being promised anything in return jimmy also sometimes go to cartman for advice such as when cartman helped jimmy with his love life in  when he thought he lost his sense of humor in  he goes to jimmy for help however cartman beats jimmy up in  in an attempt to gain kyles friendship even though jimmy was trying to help cartman   has been shown working with cartman on occasion and is the only jew that cartman does not seem to discriminate against although it is possible he does not know he is jewish which is unlikely due to events in  in the earlier seasons cartman seemed either indifferent or hostile to ike although recently he has started to work with him more ike joined cartmans crew in  and was the only jew in the crew he acted as cartmans righthand man and second in command cartman usually going to him when he needed something done  cartman is probably the only friend he has cartman and jackson have a very good relationship together in stans house when they were sleeping he was sleeping next to him cartman also wanted to have a slumber party in his house he also told everyone about mr jefferson all this occurs in   despite their previous friendship he seemed to resent his presence in  when he possessed ike and may not have recognized him cartman was later  with the rest of the boys cheering for him at the pageant and bribed the judge in order for him to win  in  cartman shows surprising respect and loyalty to billy mays for introducing him to the product  which allows him to continue eating at chipotle despite the fact that it causes blood to stain his underwear throughout the entire  cartman is motivated solely by his desire to put billy mays soul to rest never once expressing any intention to gain anything from this endeavor in the process even at the end of the  by which time cartman usually reveals his ulterior motives cartman still focuses on the fact that billy mays is at peace    cartman seems to have formed a genuine friendship with his cellmate while he was in prison in  after romper stomper showed compassion to him when he was  crying though cartman seems to have held him little regard as evidenced from when he attempted to run away from the prison while romperstomper suffered an injury and stayed behind he  to have genuinely appreciated romperstompers help after cartman was released from prison he visited romperstomper again and pooped disneyland the place romperstomper had always wanted to see into the toilet for him with nothing to gain from it in addition to his relationship with billy mays and  romperstomper is one of the few people which cartman has done a good deed for without being promised anything in return   scott tenorman is cartmans halfbrother and nemesis their first meeting was in  in which scott sold cartman his pubic hair convincing cartman it would signify maturity for him when cartman realized the truth he then proceeded to attempt several fruitless revenge plots until at last he created an elaborate scheme in which he had their father  and  killed ground up into chili and fed to scott this event drove scott insane and during his time in a mental institution he plotted his revenge they met again in  in which scott resurrected the  that cartman created as part of a complicated plan to get revenge on cartman by revealing who his real father was after capturing cartman and all the surviving possible fathers of   and  scott revealed that cartmans father was a member of the  but that the town covered up the truth because they did not want to ruin the broncos season by spreading knowledge of an illegitimate child scandal scott then explains that his own father was a member of the broncos and the only one who lived in   cartman is horrified to learn that scotts father was also his father after feeding cartman tainted chili scott escapes capture by means of a jetpack scotts plan works however in that cartman is left in tears not because his father is dead however but because he is halfginger   shelly babysits cartman in  after his mom goes off to attend the meteor shower party at first they are displeased with each others presence but then they appear to get along near the end in fact cartman comforts shelly when she feels insecure about her appearance and feels that no one likes her cartman tells her that he does not think she is ugly which makes shelly feel better and they become friends after cartman convinces her to dump her boyfriend skyler deeming him a jerk  in  when shelly walks in the living room and changes the channel while the boys are watching tv cartman tries to manipulate shelly into letting the boys continue watching by telling her that he thinks she is hot shelly is visibly angered by this remark  most people at school regularly and openly despise and hate cartman for being selfish and mean spirited also mocking him for his weight which has lead cartman to be extremely insecure going as far to be known to dismember children when they insult his weight but most of the time cartman seems to have a on and off relationship with everyone in in town  and possibly  and kenny however seem to be the only ones aware of how dangerous and mentally imbalanced he is as well as the only ones who try to keep others from falling into his manipulation eric has also been portrayed as somewhat of a bully he always insults new kids with offensive often profane words usually never leaving them alone he physically abuses others both through his fists and weapons such as when he hit  and  with rocks he is also shown to be very vulgar and disgusting doing things like holding people down and farting on them and making them smell his rectum he also tells extremely dirty jokes while many of his male peers think this is funny especially  it often causes the girls to despise him cartman is heavily implied to only pick on others because of the insecurity he has acquired from others calling him fat also despite their hatred of him all the kids seem to accept him as a leader because of his ability to manipulate people and sometimes invite him to social events such as parties and vice versa in  particularly it is implied that stan kyle and kenny only hang around with cartman because they cannot find other friends or vice versa  states that everyone at school hates them of which  immediately dismiss  the students at   elementary are all apparently aware of cartmans stuffed animals and his mental health as shown in  where craig tells cartman he should go home and cry to his stuffed animals however in the same  stan kyle and kenny express concern over cartmans safety and keep a lookout at tokens house to protect him   cartman has kennys eyes due to the events in the subplot of  kyle has one of cartmans kidneys due to the events of  it is most likely that cartman is the youngest of the four friends his birthday was in the  and it has been clear that he turned  while the other boys already were  years old however stan made it clear that cartman and all the other boys were ten years old in  while stan was still nine years old only to turn ten two s later it could be that the birth dates of all the boys were called out randomly and their permanent birthdays set in later this mix up made stan the youngest of the four boys cartman is mostly known by his family name and most characters including stan kyle wendy and token call him by his surname in  it is shown that stan and kyle pick on cartman because he is fat not because of his many crimes cartman has been shown to go to great lengths to get revenge on people who did relatively minor things an example is in  where
