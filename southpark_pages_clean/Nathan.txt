this with classi as well distribution of illegal substances during the events of  he sold steroid medication to jimmy valmer ones that do not appear on any given urine test this crime would result in nathan serving a year in juvenile hall as well as a  fine breaking and entering in  nathan and mimsy were breaking in the  to sabotage jimmy and timmys science project trespassing as one of his plans

and fireworks laws in the same  nathan plants a c explosive in the ukulele jimmy plays during the solo of the tardicaca hula gal this action is illegal because it was attempted murder and the use of

attempted armageddon during the events of   and  he tries to conquer   with ads with the help of  this was all foiled by classi betraying nathan and  killing leslie kidnappingfalse imprisonment to make his plans go successfully nathan takes jimmy hostage in his apartment to keep him from spoiling the truth by taking his crutches with leslie telling others jimmys dead in the  dlc nathan hires criminals to kidnap and kill the lake tardicaca counselors contract killing in the  dlc of  nathan has hired drugaddicted criminals dressed like halloween monsters to kidnap and kill the counselors at lake tardicaca so that the authorities can shut down the camp so that he never has to go every summer again this is then foiled by the new kid professor chaos butters fastpass jimmy doctor timothy timmy and mintberry crunch bradley before he could do so with the last remaining one   the most notable appearance of nathan is that his head is always looking up at an angle usually to one side or he might just have a comically large chin nathan has squinty eyes long dark blond hair and wears tinted glasses its unknown if these are sunglasses or prescription lenses on most occasions he wears a dark gray buttonless jacket with red trim and an orange shirt underneath gray baggy pants and green sneakers with white stripes  in  when he goes to sleep he wears a light blue onesie with blue trimmings and yellow stars he talks in a low raspy voice with a slight speech impediment ie pronouncing shark as shorwk  in  nathan  as an adult man he is  with a teal tracksuit and a gold necklace similar to mimsy he also has long hair in a ponytail stubble on his large chin and seemingly white pearls on his glasses    nathan has down syndrome he also likely has some form of sociopathy as evidenced by his plots in  while all his plots fail in a fairly cartoonish manner the intention behind them ie getting jimmy and his friends stabbed murdered poisoned raped or bled to death hints at poor mental health his anger could also be due to his parents not taking him seriously he often pretends to be more disabled than he really is to conceal his real plans such as in  when he responds to  by saying i like apples and bananas  however in  he attends kennys wake set up my jimmy and laughs at his woke jokes this implies that either his hatred of jimmy has gone away or has greatly diminished     each problem that hits nathan in the   would be fatal in real life a bite from the venomous black mamba causes death fairly quickly arrows at high velocity to the center of mass often cause death by exsanguination the weight of a fullgrown shark on top of a human is fatal a closerange explosion of c leads to instant death nathans inexplicable survival throughout the  follows a common looney tunes theme where characters survive normally fatal catastrophic events   the relationship between nathan and his parents is terrible overall since they baby him and it is possibly the main reason behind nathans morbid mind  nathan finds it hard to communicate with his parents so he barely confides in them for instance he suffers at the tardicaca summer camp every year but his parents know nothing about this until  nathan does not have much respect for them either  on the other hand his parents are totally carefree and they pay no attention to him it is revealed in  that they send nathan to summer camp just to ensure their own trip to italy    filenathanthumbnathan and mimsy in  nathans only friend is his lackey  who does whatever nathan tells him he abuses mimsy verbally and physically for their failures in the various plots against the blue team at the summer camp just as nathan is about to order mimsy to do another plot to kill jimmy a  says gee i wish our team captain was as awesome as jimmy could probably hint that a lot of people dont like him    nathan harbors an utter hatred and jealousy towards jimmy and has schemed several ploys to get him killed but they always backfire on him in his first appearance in  he sells steroids to jimmy to help him compete in the special olympics but has since developed a onesided rivalry with him jimmy has either remained oblivious to nathans disgust towards him or simply hasnt let it bother him   there seems to be less about his relationship with timmy but it might be caused with him being friends with jimmy in  nathan tried to sabotage s new handicar taxi service just to get out of summer camp   nathan is always the mastermind but not with  in  nathan is revealed to be the lackey of leslie he replaces  as the  writer and puts sponsored content as well as fake news on it he is ordered by leslie to hold jimmy hostage in his loft at   nathan explains that im just gonna make sure im on the right side of it which implies that he actually fears leslies inhuman powers he earns a big fortune by working for leslie though   nathans plan was foiled by the new kid during  and he blames the new kid for his painful endurance of mindrape this results in nathans grudge the hatred enhanced when the new kid farted on him but he still hates jimmy more   filenathanfacebookthumbpxnathans  profile nathans look and speech pattern are inspired by  sean costello of  a current events program that ran on mtv and starred reporters with developmental disabilities trey er and matt stone were the executive producers of the series the series was itself based on a   film of the same name while nathan normally talks in a fairly adult and intelligent manner he adopts a more childish voice when addressed by the adult counselors so he would not be suspected of any crimes also he has a slight speech impediment due to his disability nathans relationship with mimsy is similar to that of the warner brother cartoon characters  this similarity is further referenced when it is revealed in  that nathan has a rocky and mugsy poster in his bedroom all of nathans various plots that backfire throughout the camp games are similar to the  nathan has connections to highlevel steroids that can fool drug tests something more likely to be sold to adult athletes how he obtained these drugs is a mystery sometimes nathan would lower his head to reveal a large point at the top of his head as  in some shots of  on a similar note most of the time nathans eyes are squinted but sometimes he widens them when he is about to be in trouble as shown in two parts of  when he widened his eyes before saying uhoh especially when he found out he picked up a transgender person nathans parents know he does not like summer camp but act like they dont understand him so they can go on trips without him over the summer nathans icon can be found in the  files indicating that he was going to appear in the game but got cut from it for undisclosed reasons nathan along with mimsy is featured as bosses in the dlc for     shut up mimsy yes counselor steve i like the fun canoe miiimmmssssyyyy get ready mimsy blue team is about to go
