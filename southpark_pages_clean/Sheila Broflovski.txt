sheila broflovski is s mother and the adoptive mother of  she is frequently despised and insulted by  who calls her a bitch as she usually spoils his misguided fun in fact he has even created a song to make fun of her entitled  and the central antagonist of     upon hearing of anything she finds offensive sheila exclaims what what what and often starts something up about it cartman once noted this happens usually once a month demanding to know why at the exact same time of the month she always gets irritated by something and he always ends up getting screwed by it her bestknown protests are probably the ones connected to the terrance and phillip show   she lobbied with the other parents to have  taken off the network much like the controversy and the protests against the tv show beavis and butthead who terrance and phillip are based on though it succeeded she caused many lives to be lost when she had protesters take part in suicide attacks on the studio and a worse tv show was put on the air as a replacement she was referred to as carol in this  along with    she is offended by the influence s antics from their film asses of fire had on the children so she created mac or  since terrance and phillip are canadian she does this forgetting that her adopted son ike is also canadian  when cartman  insulting her in protest she has a vchip prototype installed in him to give off electric shocks whenever he swore  although sheila meant well in protesting the obscenity for the childrens sake it then lead to a war between  and    she was angered at the school nativity  particularly how kyle was playing joseph she forced the play to adopt a nonoffensive theme which everybody hated ultimately provoking a riot in which she beat up  as he was restrained by gerald   she was annoyed by the boys making fun of nurse gollum because she had the fictional disease conjoined twin myslexiaparasitic twin so she taught them about the disease but the boys started trying to split their heads open with ice picks to get supposed fetuses out except kyle and kenny who probably knew better this resulted in an angry phone call from sharon   a rare instance where her protest would actually help kyle she attempted to protest against cartman for leading the whole school into believing her son was responsible for  however this topic was brushed aside in favor of who defecated in the urinal at school which happened to be stan  minor protests sheila has been in protests against the iraq war in  and various others   filethumbsheila on  sheila wears a midnight blue dress suit with a white shirt and a violetred skirt underneath she also wears beige nylons red lipstick and gold earrings her hair is long and red much like her son kyles and put up in a beehive she is overweight and shorter than average height she speaks with a rather broad jersey accent in  sheila reveals that her family lived in newark new jersey that gerald impregnated her with kyle there and that they moved to   two months later in  she wore a brown bedsheet in the form of a toga for special occasions her outfit is in black and dark grey colors  when she lived in jersey sheila wore a yellow sleeveless tshirt that had swoww titty bang on it a denim jacket with the sleeves cut off gray trousers her hair in a curly ponytail and black high heels  in the future timeline set in  her hair has faded with some gray highlights she wears a red framed tinted glasses     sheila is very protective about her family and has often led huge campaigns against beliefs and other such examples which she believes are unsafe often going too far in her efforts and steamrolling her son in the process she was the cause of the americacanada war and was the leader behind mothers against canada mac she also seems to be somewhat nosy poking into things that are other peoples business for instance when she found out that  and  used to be friends in high school she arranged a fishing date between the two which had bad results in retrospect either the relationship between gerald and stuart or the fact that the broflovskis are from new jersey may be noncanon unless stuart mccormick lived in new jersey with gerald prior or gerald and stuart went to high school together in   or some other location before gerald moved to new jersey and impregnated sheila with kyle  she is also quite quick to anger when she is challenged or more correctly when someone tries to tell her she is wrong an example being that she shot terrance and phillip when kyle told her she was wrong in starting a war with canada when all he did was go see an r rated movie in normal s when kyle tries to talk back sheila raises her voice and gives him into trouble no matter how right he might be to do so  in the th draft of the script for the movie it is clear that the power of leading mac went to her head and made her insane to the point where after discovering ike cartman and kyle were at the uso show general plymkin thinks they are canadian sympathizers and wanted them executed alongside terrance and phillip and apparently she and cartmans mom were okay with it while stan and kennys mothers were shocked at this act  after the war began she went on an insane rant about how perfect her plan is to eliminate not pretty things and among other things admitted that kyle was not born in a hospital that and she mistook satan for alan dershowitz this aspect of sheilas was dropped from the main film as it seemed to be very uncharacteristic of her and to make her more sympathetic as she saw what the war lead to  however her overprotective and annoying personality and protests seem to have diminished a lot in recent seasons the protests could reveal a vulnerability in sheila in that she may have a fear of peoples perception of her as a mother she also wants to shift blame as  in  where she wants to protect the children or in the movie where in one of her songs  she states at the end of the song we must blame them and cause a fussbefore somebody thinks of blaming us  kyle even says that whenever he gets in trouble instead of holding him responsible sheila looks for someone else to blame   arson in  she burns down  stores wallmart and jims drugs murder in  she murders terrance and phillip although these deaths are reversed due to kennys sacrifice and cartmans vchip malfunctioning medical terrorism after shelly comes down with chicken pox she and the other parents expose their kids to a chicken poxinfected kenny since getting the disease at an older age can be deadly kyle later confronts his mother about this   her first name and red hair suggest that she is of irish or scottish descent however red hair is also common in jewish heritage this coincides with the fact that she and not kyles father is the more stereotypical jew in the family it is also possible that her maiden name is schwartz since kyle schwartz is her nephew     sheila is named after matt stones own mother and kyles family surname is derived from stones mothers original maiden name broslovski which was changed to belasco when her ancestors immigrated to the united states this may explain why the familys name was spelled in various ways early on in the series eg brosloski brovlofski etc  even though the entire broflovski family practices judaism on the show in real life matt stones mother is the only jew in the family and he has mentioned that he and his sister rachel were brought up agnostic his sister is the only member of his family who is not represented on the show this could possibly be because stan and in real life trey er  has a sister and with matt and trey considering themselves very similar anyway for both kyle and stan to have a sister would make them far too similar  stone claims to have learned phrases and pet names like bubbe from his maternal grandparents who like their daughter were jewish    he is sheilas husband and the town of  s most prominent lawyer the pair met while in college and apparently it was sheilas decision for them to move back to geralds hometown of   to raise their family the pair of them seem to have a strong marriage and aside from a period of gerald having erectile dysfunction have never appeared to have any obvious marital problems however in chef aid she cheated on gerald with chef and gerald strangely accepts this adulterous affair gerald seems to accept his wifes hard character activism and often supports her such as the events of  the pair have one natural born child kyle and either due to the inability to have another or simply a personal decision adopted ike their sex life is a bit unusual usually involving roleplay or kinks which one or both of their sons were unfortunately scarred by    he is her oldest son and also one of the main characters sheila has unquestionable love for kyle who loves equally as much and often defends her a lot particularly from his friendfoe  however even kyle finds her personality hard to bear at times as the things she does for him can often cause him grief and social stigmata such as protesting  as the series has progressed however sheilas activism has lessened making kyles relationship with his mother easier to deal with    he is sheilas youngest son from canada it is clear that sheila loves him as much as her biological son kyle and she often even seems to forget that he is adopted the reason for adopting ike is never clear but its possible that sheila was incapable of bearing another child after kylepossibly the reason that kyle gets sick so often sheila seems to become upset with ike when he breaks a window after kyle plays kick the baby with him    he is sheilas nephew she welcomed him with open arms during his visit to   and even to make him feel a little more comfortable promised to address him as kyle and her own son as kyle     she is sheilas deceased mother who was never  alive onscreen she apparently had the surname broflovski as this was the name on her gravestone in the   while this is most likely just a mistake it seems to imply that she and gerald had the same surname before they were married which in turn could indicate that they were related and committed incest of course it could also mean that gerald chose to go by sheilas name after marriage instead of the other way around   sheila mentioned in  that she had a sister to  by
