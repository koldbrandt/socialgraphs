 The  Warden appears in the  episode    The warden runs the camp in extreme inhuman measures he forces hard repeating labor such as fingerpainting and making macaroni pictures on inmates to torture them both physically and mentally until they lose their wills and submit to tolerance In fact he and his tolerance camp resemble Nazis and concentration camps in many aspects the only difference is that he aims to reform people not to offer pure torment  Guards at this camp call him Mein Fhrer the exclusive title of Nazi leader    He wears a typical Nazi uniform noticeably well shined boots and glasses He has narrow mustache a hooked nose and speaks in stereotype German accent He carries a revolver and uses it to intimidate  He always looks harsh and serious   Here intolerance will not be tolerated   You will not make any distinction between people of different colors People with different sexual preferences You will accept everyone    From the quotes we learn that he believes in absolute equality between races and sexual orientations But according to  the point he has always been overemphasizing is actually acceptance
