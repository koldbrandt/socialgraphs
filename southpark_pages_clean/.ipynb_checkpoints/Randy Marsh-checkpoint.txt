with useless cows as randy promoted veganism and plantbased foods making beef obsolete when the goo man actually paid him to help sabotage randys business since these are cows this can be  as common slaughter but as randy did not have a proper slaughterhouse set up this can be  as unlicensed slaughter while this is illegal randy only did this due to the fact that the cows were polluting his farm

chemical concoction of furniture polisher paint thinner bleach ammonia and antifreeze by his daughter shelly he initially was going to discard it but after seeing that the concoction enhanced the

hallucinations and was heavily implied by mayor mcdaniels to have poisoned people causing serious harm to everybody while shelly is at fault for contaminating the product randy is also accountable as he witnessed shelly contaminate his product and decided to sell it anyway in  when santa has the sale and purchase of alcohol banned during the holidays in an effort to decrease the towns amount of drunk driving the townspeople go to randy for cannabis to use to help give them some holiday spirit as it was winter and his crops were dead randy was left with the decision of selling old strains or combining them to make a new strain since this was not good enough by randys standards he decides to combine strains and then visibly lace them with cocaine when initially asked what the white substance was he said it is just a little something extra for a special kick later when mayor mcdaniels confronted him on what the white substance was randy confirmed it was in fact cocaine and that randy did not even know cocaine was illegal to begin with and that he could not just sell it to people without them knowing immediately after randy started protests to legalize cocaine for medicinal and recreational usage succeeding in making cocaine legal in seven us states including colorado while cocaine distribution became legal after this whatever cocaine randy had sold and distributed beforehand was both illegal and immoral even after randy had cocaine legalized there was massive collateral damage done to the town due to cocaine intoxication bestiality in  it is revealed randy had sex with a bat and a pangolin while he was in china together with  however this was because he was drunk with mickey and thus intoxicated into having sex with the bat and pangolin   filethumbleftrandys first appearance in  randy wears a white shirt under a bluecyan jacket with two pockets on each side and the sleeves up he also wears black pants and black shoes his leftside pocket usually has a yellow a red and a blue pen with a pocket protector as of  randy has been given a slightly more detailed redesign such as the pencil and pens in his chest pocket changing colors and no longer being depicted as simple lines  he has thick black hair with parted bangs and a thick black mustache both of which seem to evoke a s hairstyle in early s though his hairstyle was somewhat different see left up until  he did not have a dimpled chin but in and after that  he mysteriously developed one of course in the early stages of  many things changed  at bedtime randy wears deep blue pajamas with a longsleeved shirt and gray slippers though he  slim and in shape when clothed he is rather flabby and has a protruding stomach as  when naked randy also has prosthetic testicles following the removal of his own due to his selfinduced testicular cancer as  in s   in his special occasion outfit which consists of a white dress shirt a light blue tuxedo blue pants and a gold tie he has a gold handkerchief in his blue coat pocket in later seasons it changed to a brown tuxedo white dress shirt grey pants and a red tie  as of  randy now wears a straw hat a blue plaid shirt underneath a brown hooded jacket a black belt with a gold buckle filthy greenishgray pants and muddy brown shoes  in  he had a gray beard and was wearing a red coat with white buttons and black suspenders  in the future timeline set in  randy is now an elderly man with grey hair which is balding at the top he reverts back to his attire preceding  with the only differecnes being that he wears a light brown coat over his blue shirt and instead of black shoes he sports a pair of brown sandals with grey socks underneath      randy is often portrayed as an intelligent but simultaneously dimwitted quick to think naive man while all the same a caring doting father however he is also obsessive and when he gets engrossed in something his personality turns to the exact opposite he becomes immature childish and dumb during the obsession phases he has a habit of being led astray by new fads or events like many of the characters all the same he has also been known to go completely against such things though his reasons are usually selfish and immature he will also try to do a heroic thing but will then be distracted due to a selfish reason as  in  however this was caused by  because randy ignored the psychiatrists wanting about mackeys dream being so unstable another aspect and common trait of randy is that he will often take up a cause but they hypocritically abandon that cause or objective whenever he sees it as something that will damage his reputation or finds something else that will be beneficial for himself or his family such instances of this are in  when he led the townspeople to abandon all material possessions and economic activities in order to please the economy but when kyle decided to pay for everyones debt he was one of the people in line who chose to have his debt paid for immediately abandoning his previous beliefs another instance is in  when he sought out officer barbrady to shoot kids who they thought were part of isis but when he found out that they were just playing ninjas and officer barbrady accidentally shot  he immediately blamed officer barbrady along with the mayor and her staff when officer barbrady reminded randy that hed told him to shoot some kids randy insists that he was saying it as a question and tries to shift all the blame from him and target the very person hed sought out for help  randy also seems to drink a lot of coffee shown carrying a cup in most s he is in at one point or another  randy has a tendency to act very melodramatically whenever things get surreal in the show and randy is calling for his son he usually puts on an act of being very ill and weak and moaning stans name out staaaaaan randy is also shown to be a hypochondriac as revealed by stan in   in   reveals that randy does not like chicken he also does not like cherry poptarts as he expressed disgust when  pointed out that those were the only ones left in   in  randy can be  strumming a guitar with his right hand he may therefore be righthanded  he is obsessive with a few things as evidenced with his video camera in  when he videotaped his father  in the bathtub sharon stan and shelly eating dinner which is implied to have happened multiple times a  outside the house asking stan to go outside next to them sharon and shelly watching cnn sharon talking to the broflovskis and tuckers about their missing boys sharon calling someone to help with the missing boys and the  sharon frequently reprimanded him for doing this calling him an idiot at one point   randy is shown to be very violent at times he often is in mobs and flips over s truck he chops off a  hand and perhaps kills him in order to stop stan from knowing that he was a fake in  he is shown in the end of  fighting with  he is shown to be very violent again in  beating up rival baseball dads he shoots off a mans head when he fears the man is becoming homeless when homeless people take over the town he beats up a woman in  after she questions his theory about penis sizes implying that randy is hostile to anyone who accuses him of having a small dick which also explains  personality he also gets sent to anger management and then takes over a fedex building with cartman   and  he also joins the civil war reenactors with cartman and loots rapes and tortures  in  he was armed with a shotgun while hiding with other parents on top of the community center while he did not use his weapon against the surrounding homeless he did decapitate  as punishment for being homeless  in  he kills winnie the pooh in order to sell his weed in china     she is randys wife they married as randy was dressed as christopher columbus instead of an ordinary groom much to her dislike she seems to be more sensible than him at the best of times although they both are known to be very hotheaded on occasion in  they were constantly bickering and ultimately they divorce randy then became an incompetent father who spent the whole time partying the nights away and never seemed to have time for his children at the end of the  sharon decided she still loved randy and they had sex in stans tree fort they then presumably remarried up until this  they had been inseparable from each other afterward they are still loving but their relationship is a bit more complicated in more recent seasons sharon has become more annoyed with randys overthetop and childish behavior such as the events of  where she freaks out and attacks him when he spends all his time playing with a video camera while the familys lives are in danger even worse this turned out to be pointless as he had forgotten to put film in the camera in  they divorced due to his actions sharon and randy both confess to faking their happiness in their relationship however after communicating theyve become more aware of each others feelings and they reconcile in  and remarry    stan is randys son and youngest child randy loves his son very much and goes out of his way to either protect or save him as shown in s    and  stan however gets very annoyed and frustrated by randys reckless and embarrassing behavior and usually only takes his advice because he feels obliged to do so  in  stan got so irritated by the street party outside which was being led in large part by his father that he made a noise complaint all he could say when they tipped s car over was jesus christ and continued to watch in annoyed horror as his fathers action became steadily worse things infact became even worse when randy refused to help with s younger brother  who had fallen out of the window and randy ended up getting fired from his job for acting like a drunkidiot towards his boss also it may be noted that stan did not want his parents to move back together in  this may be also taken as a sign that he does not like his fathers behavior in  stan said randy exaggerates every disease he gets however stan sometimes thanks randy when the latter helps him such as saying to him youre the greatest in  when randy got him disqualified from baseball despite looking down on his behavior beforehand  randy will also publicly vocally express his annoyance in certain incidences in which stan was a part of most of the time being incredibly harsh in situations that do not call for it   filethumbrandys daughter  shelly is randys daughter and elder child she is very violent to her younger brother stan although she is very nice or at least indifferent whenever her parents are around because of this randy and sharon have remained completely oblivious to her abusive nature and when stan told them what she did they did not believe him shelly however like stan and sharon often gets annoyed with her fathers behavior rolling her eyes but rarely saying anything other than mom whats up dads ass  in  randy drove all the way to the musical to prevent shelly from giving a blowjob to   shelly does not feel like he loves her claiming that he does not even try to get to know her in  randy responds saying that he really wants to but he feels like she hates him their relationship deteriorates quite a bit once the family moves to tegridy farms as shelly has a marijuana problem   he is randys ancient father who is  years old he is suicidal though everyone merely laughs at his requests to be killed saying thats our silly grampa in  he was frustrated by the way randy spoke to him as if he were speaking to his son rather than his father stan then explained that that was partly why grampa waged the war between the young and the elderly because he did not want to be treated like he was  in  it is revealed that marvin brought randy to the  when he was little in  marvin claims to have never wanted children and that randy was supposed to be nothing but the driedup crust on gram grams titties this possible resentment may partly explain the strain on their relationship   filethumbrandys mother  she is randys mother she was once married to  however due to the fact that they do not live together and marvin had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in  this would imply that she also left marvin eventually she is currently suffering from an unknown illness in the hospital she frequents facebook and often calls randy to bully  into keeping up with her facebook status as  in    jimbo is randys brotherinlaw they appear to have a decent friendly relationship often drinking
