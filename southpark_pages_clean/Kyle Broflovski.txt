relation  uncle relativename   relation  cousin relativename   appearance    kyle broflovski is one of s main characters along with   and  based on cocreator  kyle is a member of the only jewish family in   he is often noted for this as well as his intelligence    kyle is of the  faith but this detail is not officially revealed until  despite having been mentioned briefly in the second  short and in  it was also mentioned in  cartman regularly makes derogatory remarks about the jewish people often directly in kyles presence specifically to aggravate him  kyle  to have mixed feelings toward judaism and there is conflicting evidence as to the religiousness of his family  for example while they dress similarly to many religious jews gerald for example always wears a yarmulke they apparently do not keep the sabbath or follow very strict sexual lives sheila stone mother of  was herself a secular sephardic jew kyles apparent indifference to religion may be part of his effort to fit in with his friends who are mostly roman catholic kyle is more often defensive than proud of his faith and though he regularly attends such functions as jew scouts he often has a poor grasp of the history traditions and rituals of his religion he is very naive though he is  to know more in later seasons this could be the fault of his parents who in a misguided attempt to shelter their son generally do not discuss with him the finer points of their religion for example  in the   kyle is  eating ham at  either he does not know that ham is not kosher or he does not observe jewish dietary laws it should also be noted that kyles parents were present when he heard that his adoptive brother ike was going to have a bris he was under the misapprehension that it involved cutting off the entire penis rather than just the foreskin this was despite the fact that kyle got circumcised himself  though he was too young to remember this and did not realize that he was circumcised after seeing s the passion of the christ he conceded to cartman that cartman was right about the jews all along and stood up in his synagogue to demand that the jews apologize for the death of  ironically he personally killed jesus in  though the act was not due to malice but but jesus own request so that he could resurrect himself and save stan and the hare club for men from being boiled alive like rabbits kyle was initially reluctant to agree to jesus request and concerned as to the implications of a jewish person killing christ only ultimately agreed provided that eric cartman would never know about it this also echoes the unproven and highly controversial claim that judas betrayed christ upon request not for malicious reasons when he learned of catholicisms conditions for getting into heaven he renounced his faith on the basis that if the jews were right about the matter it would make no difference if he were a catholic but if the catholics were right he would go to hell for not accepting christ in the early   when his father told him about how society works he thought of a better idea which involved sending all the poor people to concentration camps so only rich people would live gerald quickly realized he was being intolerant of people less fortunate than himself and stopped this right away this indicates that at least early in the shows run kyle did not have a very clear grasp of the holocaust or other forms of genocide despite being jewish kyle seems very excited about the baconalia event going on at the local dennys cartman used bacon filled pancakes as an enticement to get kyle involved in the crack baby basketball league although kyle is not  eating bacon his enthusiasm calls into question if he keeps kosher as part of his jewish faith in  kyle briefly denounces his faith after getting a haemorrhoid while cartman inherits a million dollars and purchases a theme  his faith is restored however when cartman loses control of the theme  and gets in trouble with the internal revenue service   according to mr garrison kyle is a smart and a student also kyle along with the other boys is portrayed as having multiple useful and trivial talents however at very rare times like most of the children he is also portrayed as being ignorant  knowledge of the universe in  kyle begins to question reality once he discovers the tooth fairy is not real he reads what seems to be every book on psychology reality and science ever written this also leads him to question whether or not he truly exists in the end of the  kyle seems to fade from existence before going into a godlike state for a while distorting reality and making a giant squirrelchicken hybrid appear in the end he returns to normal shrugging off the experience subsequently towards the end of the   kyle screams at  and the other psychic detectives causing the lights to go out and the shelves behind his hospital bed to shake and their contents to fall  video gaming kyle is often

the other being dodgeball at which pip is considered the best however in the   he goes to the allstate game tryouts and is rejected not because of his skills but because of the fact that he is short and jewish rather than tall and black oddly kyle was not in the basketball team in  though this was probably to avoid kyle being active in the fad kyle has stated that he wants to play in the denver nuggets someday on the football team however he is very talented he made a touchdown which remarked his skills he played as a guard in basketball a wide receiver in football and second base in

poetic way when he speaks philosophically questioning reality and why things are as they are in  mr garrison begins to explain haikus a form of poetry to the class but stops on noticing cartman was not in the classroom kyle shortly after comes up with three haikus on the spot which are all used to insult cartman also in  kyle is informed that cartman had three extra tickets on the th row at the raging pussies concert but kyles mom tells him he cannot go to see it unless he has done all his chores and brought democracy to cuba assuming it to be an impossible task this prompts kyle to write a letter to fidel castro who is actually convinced to bring democracy to cuba after reading kyles innocent persuasive rhymes lyrics and words kyle also seems to take a leading role in writing the book

the other  despite  dying repeatedly he experiences a painful infectious hemorrhoid when  inherits  million from his grandmother and uses it to buy his own amusement  in  he also experienced renal

hat he has red hair much like his mothers this was first shown in  he is  without his hat in         and the  arc as his vigilante alterego  his hair is a nod to s his creator old hairstyle as well as his character in cannibal the musical who also wore an ushanka in  he as depicted as a ninja with brown eyes  in several s he has appeared in different outfits other than his such as in  when  recommended that the townspeople wear bedsheets instead of normal clothes and riding llamas among other things to propitiate the economys anger kyle wore a red bed sheet in the form of a robe also on several occasions he has altered his jewfro stylishly as shown in   is gay when he briefly followed the metrosexual fad  in an exaggerated anchorman coif elementary school musical in the style of corbin bleu and in  when he transforms into a jerseyite in  a photorealistic image of him is drawn by the police along with the other boys his mother  comments that it is kind of a bad drawing   in  kyle was voted the ugliest boy in class out of the  students attending the class this shakes kyles confidence he stoops down to the level of the ugly misfit kids at school who are so ugly that he still stands out who constantly talk about burning the school down eventually stan and wendy informed kyle that the list was the result of a corrupt compromise just before kyle set the school on fire relieving kyle of his status as ugliest kid  in the original christmas short kyles appearance was drastically different instead of his orange jacket he wore a green jacket and instead of an ushanka he wore a yellow baseball cap and looked very similar to stan  in the future timeline set in  kyle has grown a full beard he wears an orange jacket over a light green shirt dark green pants and brown shoes he does not wear his trademark ushanka    originally kyles personality was extremely similar to his best friend stans  he had firm morals and generally was the good boy of the group often being the one to deliver the i learned something today speech at the end of the s after the abandoned plan to kill kyle off in season five that honor went predictably to kenny his personality was changed  most notably his temper shortened considerably like his mother kyle does speeches to say what he thinks is right  kyle has extremely strong beliefs and when forced to question them he becomes very upset and has somewhat of a short temper especially when it comes to cartman this is has caused a lot of fights between the two boys for the most part kyle bases his decisions on both his emotions and beliefs therefore he is easily coaxed into fights or manipulated by his feelings an example of this being when cartman sang  and got everyone to join in which annoyed kyle as a result this has happened at least twice   cartman is more than happy to poke fun at kyle in other ways as well which has landed him in trouble many times however kyle has been known to abandon his beliefs if there is a lot of money in it for him and selfjustify himself despite knowing how wrong he is he only changes his mind when he realizes he is turning into cartman  and  out of all the major characters kyle seems to have the greatest moral standing often refusing to go along with acts he finds wrong or evil though he is easily pressured into going through on them by his friends  kyle seems to have a strong fraternal instinct despite his initial displeasure after learning that ike was his adopted brother in  he recalls his bond with ike prior and protects him when misconceiving that ike was in immediate danger kyle has in numerous s dedicated all of his focus on saving ike or ikes general wellbeing     and  in the  he was initially the first one to show concern for the new neighbors son by promptly tending to s scraped knee when he was unnoticed by his father  throughout the  kyle willingly looks out for blanket caring for his wound taking him to stans house after showing outrage that blanket was found alone in his backyard putting him to bed trying to hide him from his neglectful father and defending him by delivering that mrjefferson should be more responsible for blankets wellbeing and should act as more a father figure  despite his short temper kyle has a wide imagination and is easily the most compassionate of  evident by how he did not find the invasive gossip from eavesdropper to be amusing unlike the majority of the other kids in his class he shows genuine empathy by reasoning that others would not find the site to be funny if it wrote about them  though kyle can also be mean and sometimes neurotic he also is known to be the most sensible and intelligent of the four and even though he sometimes puts his own emotions before common sense he usually manages to find logical solutions to problems  solutions which are often ignored in favor of something ridiculous cartmans psychic abilities for example  although kyle did manage to offer his solution through his own equally fraudulent psychic abilities  this is yet another thing that annoys kyle  after pc principal overheard that kyle did not have a glowing opinion of  he was harassed until he was forced to compromise this ultimately lost him a lot of respect as  by the death glares he receives whenever he tries to make one of his speeches  as noted by butters in  kyle believes he knows everything or at the very least believes everything has a logical explanation and is quick to dismiss any supernatural phenomenon he was rather upset when he was wrong in  and oftentimes he will sulk into an upset mood when something does not go his way     kyles mother sheila is known to be extremely overprotective she even goes so far as to instigate a war between the  and  in the featurelength movie  because of canadians s extremely scatological rrated  her motto was horrific deplorable violence is okay as long as people dont say any naughty words sheila is prone to exaggerating the issue whenever something threatens her son even so in  she turns to holistic and natural medicine when kyles kidneys begin to fail    kyles father gerald is a lawyer he serves as legal counsel for the town council though the exact nature of his regular practice is unclear he is involved in litigation at various points one time briefly becoming quite wealthy from his involvement in a spate of sexual harassment lawsuits against the town he has also represented townspeople at times including chefs case involving copyright infringement in chef aid in early s the broflovskis appear to be more affluent than much of the population in   but decidedly less so than the   gerald is usually one of the more reasonable men in   much more so than  the main adult protagonist and generally tries to teach kyle good morals as  in  although can fail to teach him the right morals as also  in the   kyle is shown to idolize his father once referring to him as the smartest guy in the world    kyle has an adopted younger  brother  when kyle first learned that ike was adopted he initially considered ike not to be his real brother becoming detached from and even resentful towards him his feelings for ike returned however after ike showed him pictures of the times they had spent together and later fled to kyles room for protection when in distress over an imminent circumcision at which point kyle fiercely defended him their relationship has been strong ever since though has been strained at times the greatest rift between them was in  where kyle reveals the illicit relationship between ike and his kindergarten teacher ike did not understand that kyle was simply trying to protect him and told kyle youre dead to me eventually ike comes to realize the folly of his relationship with his teacherand appreciates how much kyle had cared about him in  the first interactions between the two have them playing kick the baby when sheila their mother told kyle that he had to take ike with him for the day kyle complained becoming annoyed with his younger sibling he then proceeded to kick ike through the window getting ike in trouble later on as the movie develops kyle shows a strong protectiveness over ike    kyle also has a cousin from connecticut kyle schwartz who is a woody allenesque jewish stereotype he complains about many things such as his asthma gas caused by beef intake and getting slivers from wooden desks and drives kyle broflovski crazy with his heavy breathing kyle became so desperate as to try to get rid of his cousin by methods such as tying his sled to a bus and putting him into cargoload for an airplane  kyle is one of the leaders of the male student population along with cartman kenny and most notably stan he gets along with most characters although his temper sometimes alienates children he is shown to not have a great relationship with girls finding it gross when  had arranged for  to have her kiss kyle in stans clubhouse in  although it is  he is somewhat friendly with wendy often talking with her in background scenes   kyle is best friends with  they are the closest out of the four boys and they are generally  together on the show standing next to each other as well as sitting together on the school bus kyle shares an affinity with stan in many ways particularly early in the show when there were fewer distinctions to be drawn between their personalities and they genuinely care about each other they almost always side together on the many issues they encounter mainly when it is cartman who is opposing them this is frequently manifested when there is a conflict between kyle and cartman and stan offers support to kyle by siding with him  the two have their differences with kyle sometimes becoming frustrated with stan when they have divergent perspectives on something he feels strongly about and stan in turn becomes concerned when kyle gets obsessed in his rivalry with cartman though rare they have had serious disagreements and even broken up seven times in the s          and  but they have almost always reconciled in the end with the exception of  although they made up in  it is when their friendship is so tested that its depth is best illustrated on the show as in  where their fallingout creates the major conflict of the story the rift formed between them helps stan realize that what he most enjoyed about his success was not success for its own sake but rather sharing the experience with his best friend hearing this from stan a previously spurned kyle rejoins him in picking up where they left off with renewed enthusiasm only to be called fags by the game after hitting a million points  the strength of their friendship and mutual dedication has been demonstrated on the show many times in  kyle is voted the ugliest of all the boys in his class this depresses him a great deal and stan seeing how it has affected him tries to get the girls to change the list with the help of  ultimately uncovering the fact that the list was wrongfully altered and that kyle was not in fact voted last the two have even helped save each others lives numerous times when kyle develops renal failure in  stan gladly offers to donate one of his own kidneys to save his life and ultimately orchestrates the plan that tricks cartman the only compatible donor into donating one of his another example can be found in  where stan is trapped in imaginationland and kyle is the only one who can hear his voice kyle goes to extreme measures including breaking into the pentagon to stop the government from nuking imaginationland and stan along with it kyle even agreed to kill jesus at his request despite his strong misgivings in order to help him save stans life in   kyle and stans friendship has been mocked several times by others particularly cartman at one point stans dad  even told him that they should not hang out too much together or else people would start to think  ie homosexual others have insinuated they were gay as in  where cartman asked them aw do you want me to get you a room so you can make out to which kyle and stan responded by kicking him in the nuts repeatedly  it is shown that kyle could possibly be stans lawyer seeing as he was sitting beside stan after he was sued by cartman in   in  after stan is diagnosed as being a cynical asshole kyle first attempts to cope with him but after he gets worse kyle decides that he was too much of a killjoy and starts to avoid him with kenny and cartman finally he realizes stan has changed and ends their friendship however they do not make up at the end of the  like the other times and with stan not showing a single sign of getting better along with the doctors diagnosis that he will never get better it seems to be permanent but in  they made up at the very end  kyle values stans opinion of him throughout  kyle would repeatedly seek stan out to explain his involvement with cartmans crack baby association in an attempt to make sure stan did not think less of him   cartman is disliked by most of the   kids and kyle is no exception also getting referred to an asshole by the adults although in  kyle and cartman are  bonding closer to each other whilst stan suffers his new found and alienating view that everything is shitty nonetheless the feud between the two has been a recurring theme since the shows beginning cartman and kyle often exchange insults with kyle as the target of cartmans antisemitism and with kyle taunting cartman about his weight in return whenever making a point cartman will often try to outsmart kyle sometimes by making a bet with him just so that he can gloat in his face though cartman usually winds up the loser of the argument there are exceptions when cartmans improbable assertions prove true in such cases as in  where cartman saves the town from a hippie music festival and kyle is forced to watch cartman play with his new  in the school ing lot every day and in  the  begins with cartman taking kyle     and  into the forest because he had  a leprechaun in the area kyle of course does not believe him though cartman turns out to be correct  they often hang out together as a part of the core group of main characters although kyle does not include cartman in all of his activities as when he invites  instead of cartman to his birthday party at  because he does not consider cartman to be his friend  filecartmankylethumbleftcartman and kyle smiling at each other and getting along at the end of  on the rare occasions that cartmans harassment leads the two to a physical confrontation kyle is consistently shown to have the advantage for example kyle beats cartman up in  upon discovering he never intended on getting stem cell research passed to potentially save kenny in a later   while the four boys shovel the driveway of a womans property cartman sits down chatting away on his cell phone while the others work diligently kyle confronts cartman about not working and informs him that if he does not help he would not get his share of the money to which cartman replies hey dont you boss me around you fing jew i will kick your ass the next scene shows the woman of the house opening the door at the sound of knocking to reveal the four boys standing outside cartman holding a bloody nose and kyle standing with an irritated expression when the woman asks what happened cartman tells her it was a shoveling accident when they all go inside to treat cartmans injury cartman says youre so lucky i have a sore shoulder kyle or else id totally let you have it implying that kyle was the one who bloodied his nose in  cartman threatens to beat kyle up if they were not home in time for christmas following cartmans incessant complaining and threatening when it  that they would not in fact make it home in time kyle throws one jab at cartmans face who quickly breaks down and cries for his mother in  kyle publicly beats up cartman after he realizes that cartman intentionally infected him with the hiv virus later in the  kyle marches to cartmans house and begins breaking all of his toys which cartman is physically powerless to stop perhaps the most extensive physical confrontation between the two however is their final battle during  kyle initially beats cartman but cartman gains the upper hand by pretending to surrender and then immediately turning on him by kicking him in the balls neither really wins this conflict though kyle is saved by bart simpson when he knocks cartman out from behind with his skateboard  despite the tension between kyle and cartman they have each demonstrated some concern for the others wellbeing in  kyle referred to cartman as a friend and explained that he was really concerned that cartman would go to hell if he tried to participate in the special olympics kyle even risked his own life to save an ostensibly sick cartman in  by carrying him to safety in a flooding cave despite the fact that cartmans weight threatened to sink kyle and nearly did cartman has also saved kyles life in  cartman realizes that his life is empty and hollow without having kyle around to rip on and he braves the smug storm to save kyle and his entire family he did not however take credit for this not wanting to admit how important kyle was to him cartman also brought kyle back to life in  after kyle was attacked by manbearpig this time because he had not yet had a chance to humiliate kyle by making him suck his balls to fulfill a bet also at the end of  cartman say that he is still a jersey kid and that he is a monster inside but hell always be his little monster their relationship is perhaps best summarized by kyle in  where he refers to cartman as my sortof friendish kyle also saves cartman from a  that is raping him in  kyle brings cartman home in the middle of the night tucking him in bed and even removing his shoes at the end of the  he puts his hand on cartmans shoulder and says that he believes cartmans claims that he is jewish now   even with cartmans consistent hostility and genuinely antisocial behavior kyle is sometimes deceived by cartmans feigned good intentions this is  in    see below and other s this may be due to an idealistic belief that there is some good in everyone even in cartman other times kyle makes it perfectly clear that he knows cartman is manipulating him or trying to as in  and  in  kyle cannot resist laughing at the irony that cartman of all people was infected with hiv feeling on some level that he deserves the disease kyle has also occasionally turned the tables and manipulated cartman into doing foolish things such as when he convinced cartman that he would die and suggested he go out to the ocean to be a pirate in  his conflict with cartman has become increasingly intense and is now a major focal point of the show  in  kyle and cartman seem to be on better terms than ever and they are shown smiling amicably at each other while playing xbox however they fight once more in  after kyle found out that cartman was sticking hamburgers up his butt and selling them to people therefore causing their business to shut down   his relationship with  may be the most complex relationship portrayed in the entire show it is difficult to define their connection as friendship or as enemies they seem to fit in the middle as many people often describe them using the portmanteau word frenemies   kyles friendship with kenny is not as strong as his friendship with stan in the  chickenpox he claims that he does not give a rats ass about kenny to try and get out of spending the night at kennys poverty and then chickenpox stricken household nor is it adversarial like that with cartman but is clearly existent they rarely interact oneonone kyle regularly includes kenny in many of his activities   and although his friendship with kenny is not as noticeable when stan or cartman are around when the two are alone together they have been known to be quite friendly towards each other kyle promptly beats up cartman in defense of kennys honor and memory following one of his permanent deaths in kenny dies in  a once again dead kenny bequeathed all of his belongings except his  to kyle and stan and in his will said dudes you were the best friends a guy could have to which kyle responded thats really touching indicating a meaningful relationship between the two he invited kenny to jew scouts in  and in  comforted kenny before leaving to confront disney about the purity rings one of which was slowly turning kenny into a boring douche   filethumbpxkyle tries to help butters in  kyles friendship with butters is fairly decent and he prefers him over cartman kyle generally treats butters well such as when he defended butters for not kissing a girl in  another example is when kyle tried to help butters when they were diagnosed as sex addicts in  however like the other boys he is not above using butters as a guinea pig when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs blaming him for writing the tale of scrotie mcboogerballs  furthermore when kenny was dead during the sixth season he along with stan would coerce butters to do things by saying kenny would have done it he would constantly talk about how kenny was cool with the other two and abandon butters until he would do often dangerous tasks he also occasionally makes fun of butters swears at him or calls him names conversely butters has been shown to harass kyle as shown in  and he has also bullied him for being jewish though this is usually under cartmans influence   bebe stevens had a crush on him in the   mainly because of her sudden interest in kyles ass she wrote in a note that she could sleep for days on his perked cheeks and wanted to wear his ass as a hat unfortunately as the note was being passed around it got to stan and mr garrison thought that he was trying to pass it around so he forced him to read it aloud to the class and stan subsequently got in trouble for that wendy then helps bebe try to pursue a relationship with kyle who is oblivious to her attempts it eventually becomes clear that kyle does not share her feelings as when he stan wendy and bebe play truth or dare in stans clubhouse wendy dares kyle to kiss bebe on the lips and when she does kyle expresses fear and shock and flees from the clubhouse bebe ultimately decided that she could not take the codependency of a relationship and purported to break up with a mostly apathetic kyle  the only time kyle ever showed any interest in bebe was when she began developing breasts in the   although every other boy in the class shared the same sudden interest later in the  kyle helps her to throw rocks at cars with the other boys and eventually goes into an apelike primal state with all of the other boys at the end kyle and all of the other boys realized that they were attracted to bebes breasts and decided they should not be influenced by them  kyles general ignorance and possible fear of girls mainly in earlier s could stem from the fact he is only  and is not into girls yet or perhaps he is wary because of his parents whose relationship at times slightly resembles master and pet especially when his mother is protesting about things   kyle first becomes concerned for heidi in  when cartman devises plans to kill her off right in front of him kyle reprimands cartman for this saying that heidi is a nice girl and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly  they briefly date in the   after kyle convinced heidi to break up with cartman and they develop mutual feelings for each other their relationship was later ruined by cartman who tricks her into believing that kyle planned to have her break up with cartman just so he could ruin their relationship and inadvertently calls him a dirty jew shocking him heidi breaks up with kyle and walks away with cartman who makes an evil smile at him   in  kyle along with stan kenny cartman and all the other boys in the class develops a crush on their slutty substitute teacher ms ellen chef eventually tells the boys that ms ellen is a lesbian however since neither kyle nor his friends not even kenny whose understanding concerning sexual topics is usually greater than that of the other boys understand what a lesbian is their crush on ms ellen continues in a misguided attempt to become lesbians themselves the crush evaporates however when ms ellen is removed as a substitute and eventually launched into the sun by a large scale plot orchestrated by    rebecca was a girl kyle had a crush on in  the two first met at the annual school bee for   elementary despite the fact that she and her brother mark were homeschooled rebecca lacked knowledge about love and was quite inept socially due to her sheltered upbringing however a determined kyle explained to her the importance of love they then kissed after he explained love is displayed by a kiss and almost immediately rebeccas confidence grew the two agreed to go to the school dance together but rebecca ended up making out with other boys at the due much to kyles shock she has not appeared or been mentioned since so it is a major possibility that kyle had got over her   nichole was interested in a relationship with kyle at the beginning of  cartman told nichole that kyle was his boyfriend which she understood and accepted due to intervention from eric cartman nichole chose to have a relationship with   after nicholes relationship with token ended temporarily kyle took her to a denver nuggets game in order to attempt to have a relationship this was quickly thwarted by cartman who announced his love for kyle at the basketball game   kyle showed an interest in  while protecting her in before leslie was revealed to be a robot and killed by    in the mandarin dub for   airing in china among the things changed are kyles religion  he is a buddhist in these versionscite weburl  in mandarin kyle is the only one of the four boys to have never been absent for more than one  in the same season or for two consecutive s kyle is the only person in  who shares eric cartmans blood type ab negative kyles birthday is revealed to be may  however in the   kyle is having his birthday party and says he is inviting butters because he invited him to his birthday party last month as revealed in  butters birthday is september  this is probably just a continuity error in the   it is shown that stans evil twin has a black beardmustache and kyles evil twin has a brown beardmustache though according to his hair color it should be red however his hair color had not been chosen back then and it is also common for people with red hair to have a brown beard kyle has killed  and  as well as a united states soldier dressed up as a  however all of these kills may be justified jesus death was to make him resurrect himself and save the  from being boiled alive in  kennys death was due to him being the original zombie in  and killing him stopped the zombie threat in   the wizard alien that kyle kills was to save america or the world in  though it was actually just a way for married men to get away with having affairs with women kyle finds pee to be very disgusting even refusing to be in water that people have peed in as  in  however he seems to hate bananas more in the   even though he is a daywalker the other ginger kids still capture him this is because he is not a full ginger as his father has brown hair not red hair in the   his name is spelled kile barffloski on the sign outside of the bowling alley in the   kyle is revealed to have been in new jersey for the first couple of months of fetal development kyles jersey name is kyleyb he is also  to reveal his jersey side when angered in  kyles anime self has black hair which he does not have kyles email
