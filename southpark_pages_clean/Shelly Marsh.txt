gave her a dowdy appearance and gave her low selfesteem causing her to pick on her brother Stan No one believed Shelly was beating up Stan due to the fact when their parents were around she would act sweet and innocent although Shelly whacked Stan a few times in front of her parents but received no punishment  Despite the increasing use of the Marsh family over the recent seasons Shellys role has

this to  Besides being insecure about her looks she is also bitter and jealous over the fact that her family often pays more attention to her brother than her  In addition to revealing her vulnerable side during Cat Orgy Shelly has also been found to show compassion for her little brother Stan usually after he plays the BrotherSisterFamily Card when all other choices have been exhausted A perfect example of this is the episode  where Stan and the others are threatened to be killed by Trent Boyett Shelly vows to protect her little brother because killing him is her job In the same episode she

locked up in jail when he tells the police about her having a marijuana problem and he feels no remorse over it  In  Shelly was very happy when she found out Randy went to jail and hoped he could
