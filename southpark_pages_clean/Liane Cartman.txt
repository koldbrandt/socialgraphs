    is the mother of  She makes many appearances throughout  and is considered to be one of the most prominent out of all the  parents She first appears in the  episode    Liane is a goodnatured individual but with a definite edge to her Her voice is usually kind and soft but sounding even more sweet in the th through th seasons when she was voiced by Eliza Schneider and her actions are usually to aid others particularly her son She is also a great cook as implied by Stan and Chef in   However there has been many implications that Ms Cartman is as racist and antiSemitic as Eric who on numerous occasions at least during the early seasons quoted his mother on saying offensive and politically incorrect statements regarding black people gays and Jews Despite this Liane herself has not vocalized these opinions on the show so it is certainly possible that Eric was lying An example can be seen in  when Cartman claimed his mom took him to see the movie The Passion in argument that proves Jews are sneaky liars  In accordance with her sweetnatured motherly image she was originally frequently shown giving people her baking usually cookies even in situations where it is inappropriate For example in  she gives a plate of cookies to  at the Drunken Barn Dance and behind the Cartmans couch is a picture of her and Cartman by Mount Rushmore in which she is holding a plateful of cookies  She has also been shown numerous times to be extremely promiscuous being referred to as a slut numerous times making several sexual jokes having sex tapes of her and Mr Mackey etc  She is also known to host great parties   She is named after Liane Adamo the exfiance of South Park cocreator  The engagement was broken up because she reportedly committed infidelities on Parker during their engagement Hence the promiscuous nature The character of  is one of the characters another was the horse Liane from Parkers Cannibal The Musical Parker created as a bitter tribute to her    In  it was stated that  was a hermaphrodite meaning that she had both male and female sexual organs and that years ago during the  she proceeded to have sex with a series of men and women After it was revealed that Liane was Cartmans father and mother due to the fact that she was a hermaphrodite  However in  Eric Cartman and  go to  and  who revealed that the events of  were a fabrication and the results for the paternity test were tampered with and that However the identity of the father was not told until  in which Cartman was captured by his archfoe  who then revealed that Liane was not a hermaphrodite and  Cartmans real father was Scotts own father  a Ginger who played for the  and who Cartman had arranged to be killed made into chili and fed to his halfbrother Scott It is explained that Liane had questioned whether or not to tell Eric not because of her own personal feelings but because the Broncos had been having a really good year and she along with the rest of the town did not want to distract from the game season   Liane shows great deference to her overweight son  and has been seen on numerous occasions bowing to his will constantly spoiling him rotten She also ignores his obesity often saying that he is just bigboned and will usually give him some normal food smothered in junk food as seen in the pilot episode  giving Cartman a chocolate chicken pot pie with icing on top Of course Erics obesity is at least partly genetic It is seen that Eric and his mother have a great bond with each other However since  she has begun to grow resistant to his whining and his demands  seen in  and  where she is quite stern with him when he shows great impatience regarding the release date of the Nintendo Wii console She shows further resolve in   and  during which she punishes Cartman for his behavior and violent actions against his friends particularly  and  She also shows further resolve in the episode  where she refused to buy Cartman an iPad because it was way too expensive and then refused to head back to Best Buy to get a Toshiba Handibook due to Cartmans unacceptable behavior at the store  Liane rarely raises her voice the most prominent occasion being in  in which she suggests he go out and play with his friends and then shouts dont be difficult Eric when he protests and in  during a school meeting when Sheila insinuates that Liane does not love Cartman enough to vaccinate him Liane yells at her and the rest of the protesting parents that none of them have had to hold Eric down and go through what she goes through and the only discipline she dispenses is a very rare slap on the head when Eric embarrasses her in public in  and  and infrequent grounding such as when he tried to exterminate the Jews or when he saw the  movie two times then accidentally made Kenny set himself on fire She has shown admonishing him not to pick his nose to which he insists he was only scratching it In  Liane not only punishes Eric for being bad every time he talks back to her she would raise her voice In  Liane again shows a strong stance against her son as she is seen yelling at Cartman for loudly implying that she was fucking him leading others to believe he means sexually when in truth he means figuratively She seems to have no issue yelling at him in public anymore as she berates Cartmans misbehavior on the Dr Phil show In  although initially allowing Eric to get away with not receiving his shots and receiving a toy after every visit she decided not to force her child to get shots although when he asked to get a toy she firmly yelled that he would not be allowed to get a toy since he did not receive his shots demonstrating she is no longer willing to reward Eric when he does not deserve it  Liane has also supposedly instilled in Cartman some of his bigoted behavior towards the Jews gingers and black people Cartman was often heard to quote his mothers supposed beliefs much to the surprise of his friends and the towns people Liane however has never vocalized these opinions on camera leading to questions of whether or not she really said them or if Cartman misquoted her or made it up However in  Liane created for Cartman an Adolf Hitler costume for Halloween which at the time Cartman had no idea who Hitler was In  she told her her son to stay away from Kyle because he had AIDS when Kyle actually had kidney failure Also in  she had Kyle hold s catheter bag This implies some sort of bigotry or at least ignorance on Lianes behalf In  she screamed when she realized that Cartman turned ginger though Kyle Stan and Kenny dyed his hair and whitened his skin to make him look ginger However  and  are both ginger   Despite her sweetness she is extremely promiscuous Quite early on it was stated that Ms Cartman was actually Erics father as she was supposedly born a selffertilizing hermaphrodite with both female and male genitalia though  implies in  that she no longer has the latter However in the episode  it is revealed that she actually is not a hermaphrodite and that the town of South Park lied in order to protect the Denver Broncos  In the early seasons she was very sexually active and regularly pursued this activity She was reputedly a crack whore and has taken part in German scheisse movies She also had no issue with commencing sexual relations with complete strangers instead usually inviting them to the home as frequent visitors This appetite is not strictly for men for it is hinted in  that she had intercourse with Ms Crabtree Mayor McDaniels and Sheila Broflovski  Although Liane used to constantly have sex and ignores the presence of anyone around her to sexually persuade men into her bedroom it is unknown if Cartman knew the full extent to what his mom really did behind closed doors Eric has come across various numbers of porn sites and socalled family videos gone awry but seems to either ignore the fact that his mom is a slut or looks as it to be just his sweet loving mother conned out of her own environment such as when he explains that his mother told him she was young and needed money when she was featured in Crack Whore Magazine in the episode  to which Stan retorts Cartman those photos were taken a month ago Cartman knows not to complain to his mother probably already figuring out that if he makes her feel bad about hurting her son she will eventually turn on him and no longer spoil him in the natural way Even in the episode  and  where it is revealed to Eric that his mom has had sex with the entire town he still has no conversations with his mom about her secret life Also in  she ends up having sex with the cyborg from the future   In later seasons her character seems to have changed For instance her working as a prostitute has only been occasionally referenced since the fourth season She is now generally shown to be more responsible with Eric especially in  and  However in  Cartman mistakes his moms screams of pleasure for cries of sadness when in reality she is receiving sex from a plumber whom she invited to her house Aside that instance Ms Cartmans infidelities have remained virtually unmentioned between the fourth season and   In  if the New Kid hits Liane with a weapon she will either yelp or moan in amusement or say Oh my which reveals Lianes sexual appetite  She can be seen again in  when she decides to start again her Tutoring classes in the town in which she ask  to help her spread the tutoring business cards in  and giving it to three men  She also appears in  as Sorceress Liane a fighter under the Fantasy theme with the ability of turning nearby enemies into  upon her death   FileScreenshotbynimbusthumbLianes formal black dress Liane is about average height for an adult female  character She wears a turquoise sweater and brick red trousers Her outfit slightly resembles that of Cartmans in that her sweater is the same color as his toque and her trousers are like his coat She has long brown hair which is usually tied back in an oldfashioned bun design and wears a rosy lipstick and usually has a sweet motherly expression on her face  For special occasions she wears a black dress with gray lining on the top and large cleavage window In  she wears a red version of this dress When dressed for bed she wears either a dark cyan nightgown or a pink robe and often wears a green facial mask  When outside of the house or reentering the house she is often seen wearing a light brown trench coat over her usual outfit especially in newer episodes from the  and  seasons It is usually buttoned up with a belt around her waist but sometimes she leaves it open She wears it most prominently in  where she wears it for nearly the entire episode  In  she wore glasses while driving which implies that she is nearsighted However in later episodes such as  she drives without them  In  she wears the same black formal outfit as in  but with a pointed sorcerer hat and a broom despite her card artwork showing that she wears a black bodysuit  In  she wears a yellow face covering over her mouth and nose during the riots She wears it over her chin while standing on the street outside the school waiting for Mr Mackey to make an announcement on the students conditions     FilecartmanfamilygifthumbpxThese are some of Lianes relatives Liane understood a Germanspeaking man in  indicating that she may be of German descent though it may just be that she learned the language while filming the scheisse films which are German According to Eric she is DutchIrish on her mothers side  Her family is shown for the first time in the episode  where she her son and the rest of the main four go on a trip to Nebraska to visit them for Christmas Most of her relatives appear to be similar in matter to her son all fat with the same speech impediment and catchphrases such as Kickass and RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH No Pets name thats my pot pie No Pets Name thats a bad Pets Name The family is seen again in the beginning of the episode  at her mothers funeral  where she leaves her estate valued at  to Eric citing that all the other family members would have spent it all on crack  Her parents names are Harold and  deceased Her brothers are named  and Stinky Her sisterinlaw is named Lisa Her two nephews are named Fred and  She has a teenage niece named  And she has a grandmother named   Various other unnamed members of the Cartman clan were shown in the episode as well as in    In terms of friends she seems integrated into the circle of parents around the town often seen interacting with    and the other parents when they congregate However the episode  seems to imply that Liane has few or no friends and that her servitude to her son is a psychological attempt to make up for that Given how rarely she is seen alone with the other mothers  usually while the children are playing or as a group  it is possible that she does not consider them friends due to their relationships being more related to their children Her loneliness could also be a reason for her promiscuity   In the episode  she is seen smoking crack which is stated by Cartman to be an old joke In Season s  she tells police she has not done drugs in a long time It has been said that Liane is the name of the longtime lover and exfiance of Trey Parker When he found of her repeated infidelities on him he was inspired to create this character who is promiscuous and a drug addict Not to mention an inept mother Other characters sometimes call her Mrs despite the fact that she has never married
