first appears in  when  is required to give a report on the effect of Latino culture on the arts in America he says that he has a special guest  However the real Jennifer Lopez does not show up Cartman merely does a ventriloquist act with his hand acting as the head of Ms Lopez The racism of Cartmans report is quite obvious and upfront His Ms Lopez hand puppet has a heavily caricatured Mexican accent and constantly talks about eating tacos and burritos despite the fact that Jennifer Lopez is Puerto Rican Ms Lopez is also completely incapable of pronouncing the J in her name which Cartman tries to correct unsuccessfully Despite this the board of Hispanics gives him first place for having the best report and he wins a  gift certificate at the mall  While at the mall Cartmans hand demands to make a music video at a music store which soon gets the attention of Hollywood Record executives They proceed to hire Hennifer because she is supposedly younger and more attractive than the real Jennifer Lopez who is furious at being replaced When the HandLopez then steals her thenboyfriend  the real Lopez goes insane and attempts to murder both the hand and Cartman   Caught between the psychotic Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck the record executives and the police Hennifer reveals herself to be a male conartist named  Mitch confesses to playing everyone for chumps before killing himself by taking a cyanide pill In truth Cartman just opened his hand Cartman explains that the whole thing with his hand taking on a personality was real stating Look I dont care what you guys believe But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town isnt it possible just possible that something I dont understand happened here When the others concede that maybe it could be possible Cartman reveals it all to be an elaborate prank he did to screw with   and   However MitchHennifer Lopez returns in  When the celebrities that South Park has wronged over the years plan to take revenge against South Park by filing a classaction lawsuit Cartman appears amongst them with his hand again dressed up as Jennifer Lopez Despite having Cartman with her the other celebrities immediately welcome her into the group and reveal their plans  Apparently their plan was to join in on the lawsuit to get money but Cartmans hand instead wants to help the celebrities steal  power of not being ridiculed and sell on the black market When Cartman refuses to go along with it Mitch tempts him with the truth of who  is Cartman initially does not believe Mitch stating that his mother  is his father Mitch explains that the story fed to him was a lie and that the tests were faked They then go to  so as to meet with  Garrisons old puppet teaching assistant who was disregarded shortly after Mr Garrison came out as gay Claiming to be old war buddies Mitch and Cartman force Garrison and Mr Hat to admit that the tests were tampered with and prepare to reveal the truth  At the end of  Cartmans father is revealed to also be the father of Cartmans archfoe  and a member of the   As everyone is recovering from the events of the twoparter Mitch says goodbye to Cartman explaining that there is a bounty on him and that he cannot stay in one place for long Before leaving however he consoles Cartman who is horrified not by the fact that he caused the death of his own father during the events of  but instead by the fact that his own father is a  Mitch however reminds Cartman that although he might be part ginger he was also part Bronco which cheers up Cartman considerably Cartman opens his hand once again and Mitch disappears leaving many to wonder when he will be ever be seen again   Mitch is Cartmans left hand with eyes drawn on it two eyes and a light pink upper lip on their index finger and a darker pink lower lip on their thumb When the hand is balled into a fist the facial features form a coherent appearance with the thumb being moved to mimic speech As Hennifer Lopez Mitch wore a brown wig and pink lipstick He also can disguise as everyone   While Mitch seems to act mostly in selfinterest he does seem to be empathetic comforting Cartman at the end of  Whether Mitch is himself or Jennifer Lopez he is a real chatterbox   During  Cartman initially seems intent on just doing a comedic and insulting bit by doing a ventriloquist bit with his hand However as the episode progress Cartman begins to behave as if his hand is really a living being arguing with it and even doing things that he would normally never do such as jerking off Ben Affleck on multiple occasions or allowing himself to be physically assaulted by Jennifer Lopez at one point during the episode the doctor examining Cartmans broken hand tells Liane that his injury is the least of his problems and that he appears to be completely insane This appears to be a psychotic break on Cartmans part though he deems it as being something more than that when confronted by his friends At the end of the episode he states it to be somewhat of a prank saying I got you kinda I got you kinda Implying either he made up  and then Mitch developed a conscience or  came to him and told Cartman who he was and dressed as Jennifer Lopez to win the  dollars for Cartman and secretly screw with Ben Affleck and the real Jennifer Lopez Cartman saying he kinda got Kyle Stan and Kenny means that Mitch might have told Cartman what he was doing but did not tell Cartman who he really was or what he was secretly up to when Kyle had asked Cartman Who is   However in  Cartman begins doing the Hennifer Lopez bit again However unlike last time he seems more driven by money and his friends have absolutely nothing to do with his plan or even interact with him and Mitch Cartman again proceeds to have arguments with the hand even alone in a room where nobody could hear them and it seems that the hand has knowledge of things that Cartman does not such as the truth about his father The fact that Cartmans hand is acting more independently and has knowledge Cartman lacks suggests that either Cartman has gone completely insane or like   may in fact be somewhat sentient    During either battle with him he will have most of the abilities of whoever he is on the hand of Cartman or Kyle albeit some of them are modified slightly For example Cartmans Coon Claws ability is simply a punch when performed by Mitch The real danger comes from his ability to randomly apply status effects gain shields that reflect damage dealt with him and generally ignore the rules of the game altogether The New Kid and the others will have to defeat him while working around his constant cheating   According to The Coon  escaped prison following the failure of his original plan to impersonate Jennifer Lopez but was presumed dead in an oil rig explosion He later resurfaced with tintent to run for Mayor of South Park convincing The Coon to help him on the grounds of the increased crime and anarchy giving him ample enemies for his superhero franchise  s plan was to cause a massive upsurge in crime in South Park by lacing the towns alcohol and drugs with cheese an addictive hallucinatory drug made from cat urine The resulting anarchy would cause  to lose favor with the public allowing Mitch to make his own move for the seat Once elected he could then bend the law in his favor and make every day Christmas seemingly because Christmas was the day with more crime in the year as Toolshed stated  To achieve his nefarious goals  united all of South Parks criminal elements including Russian Chinese and Italian gangsters His main operatives were the corrupt cops of the South Park Police Division who he enticed into working for him by promising to let them continue their clandestine activities He also managed to gain the allegiance of  who he sent to take over DMobile in an effort to stop  from tracking his activities the Sixth Graders and a group of Meth Heads He even managed to fund the likes of  enabling the wouldbe supervillain to prepare a truly massive plan to turn the entire town into lava and Dr Mephesto convincing him to turn the resources of his genetics lab to helping s schemes  Confronting the Freedom Pals After the  merged with   made his move influencing The Coon into destroying s painstakinglydetailed franchise plan while kidnapping The New Kids parents He ordered the New Kid to complete a series of tasks for him effectively forcing them to promote his electoral campaign by taking selfies with his supporters Doing so however allowed Call Girl to pinpoint his location the South Park Community Center Once confronted Mitch attacked by possessing The Coon bending the rules of reality itself to benefit him nonetheless he was thwarted by the heroes He then vanished from The Coons hand leaving his host to be apprehended by the Freedom Pals for interrogation  After interrogating The Coon the Freedom Pals tracked s operations to Dr Mephestos lab learning of his plans to become Mayor by raising crime In response Mitch unleashed his trump card a horrifically mutated  In order to defeat the abomination s final epic Timefart ended up accelerating time by ten days more than enough time for Mitch to complete his election race and entrench himself in South Park City Hall A year later his plans were in full swing turning South Park into a dystopian holiday nightmare especially since he managed to bring in the Woodland Critters as his enforcers  However The New Kid managed to fart the Freedom Pals back in time allowing them to confront The Coon just before he could begin setting Mitchs plans into motion Seemingly cornered Conner revealed his final contingency how to make someone fart really hard by hitting them in the solar plexus By punching the New Kid to travel even further back in time  hoped to erase his greatest enemy from time by interrupting their backstory unfortunately for him this only gave the New Kid the selfconfidence they needed to fart themself and The Coon forward in time just before Mitchs official election as Mayor  When The Coon rushed to stop Mitchs election he was confronted by the Freedom Pals with  demanding that he reveal Mitch to be nothing but a persona The Coon denied this but the situation suddenly became much more complicated  appeared on Human Kites hand instead claiming that his true plan to stop his enemies was to drive a wedge between them More perplexingly still another  appeared on The Coons hand claiming that Human Kite was possessed by a Mitch from an alternate universe After much backandforth combat  decided that the Freedom Pals needed to defeat both s using his own psychic powers to prevent either one from cheating further  After both Conners were defeated Human Kite and The Coon each attempted to force the other to confess that they were just fucking with everyone only for The Coon to trick his rival and make a quick getaway Rushing to the park where the citizenry had gathered for his swearingin  tried to get himself elected but the Freedom Pals caught up and revealed his trickery With his plans in shambles  revealed his reasons at last like the New Kid someone had fucked his father To his shock his mother appeared on The Coons other hand and told him that she was responsible enraged and betrayed Mitch attacked her killing them both   Mitch Im Hennifer Lopez And I like Tacos and Burritos from  Mitch When you eat food comes out your backside too cholo from  Mitch I wonder Will I dream upon supposed death from  Mitch The citizens of South Park deserve to feel safe Safe from vigilantes who go around farting on peoples heads Together we can free ourselves from the anal terrorism that has been forced upon us My name is  and I endorse this message from  Mitch Well well well if it isnt the Freedom Pals and their newest recruit from South Park The Fractured But Whole Mitch Ill tell you why Because the New Kidisnt the only person who got a parent get fucked My dadgot fucked when i was nine years old her backstory from South Park The Fractured But Whole Mitch Then how do you explain this Kyle from South Park The Fractured But Whole Mitch Well Well Well the plot thickens from South Park The Fractured But Whole being revealed by The Coon as the perpetrator supporting Professor Chaoss  in the Coon Lair making a video call to The New Kid informing that he has held The New Kid assaulting The New Kid assaulting The New Kid making his escape holding making his escape showing up on The Coon making his escape after The New Kid manages to break into the bedroom to stop The New Kid appearing on The real  appearing on The Coon on Human Kites hand confronting the real making his appearance on the podium of South Park Town Squares mother appearing on The Coon and his mother getting themselves killed     Most of the time  talks Cartman opens his mouth just a little However in episode  while Cartman is walking down the sidewalk Mitch asks him What the hell do you think youre going kid with Cartmans mouth completely shut The same thing happened again in  shortly before Cartman shoves a flashlight up Mitchs mouth In  after Kyle said to Cartman Stop talking with your stupid hand  replied Who are you calling stupid Jew Cartman was seen talking with his mouth moving while making Mitch respond to  which hints at sentience In   seems to know more about Cartmans  than Cartman himself When Conner states to Cartman about never knowing who his father was Cartman is surprised However  knew that they had to turn to Mr Garrison Whenever Mitch leaves Cartman simply opens his hand and flutters his fingers slightly In  Cartman uses  as an alias when informing the psychologists wife of a fictitious webchat with a fourteenyearold girl that causes her suicide This may confirm him as only an identity and not a separate being but it seems to go against  and  which could mean he is merely honoring  by using that name  said he was in the Vietnam War Cartman said in  that he was having a flashback from when he was in Nam It is unknown whether or not these are connected  and Hennifer Lopez are parodies of ventriloquist wikipediaSeor WencesSeor Wences and his hand puppet Johnny In  when Cartman and  are talking in s closet Mitchs eyes can be seen blinking   s last name seems to be a reference to his conman personality Although it is generally accepted that  is a rusemouthpiece for his victims thoughts and plans there are hints that he may be a genuinely supernatural entity Alternatively these can be interpreted as products of the kids imaginations similar to the devastating and grandiose uses of their superpowers He can appear and disappear from The Coons hand remarkably quick especially since The Coons claws disappear from his hand when  manifests Notably when  confronts The Coon in South Parks past Mitch appears on The Coons hand despite it being in his best interests to remain hidden  once again he somehow removes The Coons claws and puts on his face in an instant The  that appears on s hand sounds identical to The Coons version despite Kyle having a completely different voice from Cartman Kyle claims that he made it up to fuck with them all but it is unknown which is the lie he talks about When  speaks his victims mouth never moves even when they have no known talents in ventriloquism One of Conners superpowers is to quickly teleport to a host and then teleport away from them in an instant In the final battle he is also shown to be able to control the mind andor body of his host These are similar to Doctor Timothys teleportation and mind control powers suggesting that he may also be a Psychic class His ability to bend and manipulate reality creating random Status Effects stealing turns and changing the rules of the game similar to the Stick of Truth so easily and effortlessly means that he could probably do magic as well suggesting that he may be a Mystic class Though he may be dualclassing it as a MysticPsychic    ru  zh
