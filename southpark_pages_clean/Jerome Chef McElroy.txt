it eventually got on chefs nerves leading him to say goddammit children why do i always have to be the one to teach you these things but went on to explain to them whatever they wanted to know anyway

salty balls connelly mimicking childrens voice oh you mean like a chocolate candy darth chef no i mean my balls  connelly as a parody of darth sidious was very happy about darth chefs reply and responds with an evil laugh  darth chefs voice was provided by  who voiced darth maul in  however he has not reappeared it is now highly unlikely for him to return due to isaac hayes death darth chef does however appear along with many other characters in the background of the   opening sequence while he is in chefs place in the crowd of waving townspeople beginning right after the return of chef the clip of him waving is inserted into the opening beginning in  instead of waving he is  threateningly activating his lightsaberspatula  it should be noted the name darth chef has been generally accepted by fans but is never actually used on the show it is however mentioned on    after chef died the children were never  getting lunch again until crme fraiche and it was unknown who replaced chef however in   was  in the background implying he took over for the time in crme fraiche the boys are  in the lunch line and are greeted by  with chefs familiar lines hello there children and hows it goin he also wore an apron that was similar to chefs only smaller and he reveals there was an opening for a cafeteria chef chef himself is not directly referenced in the  though and randy quits at the end meaning it is likely mr derp or another staff member took on the role again  chef is  briefly during a trailer for  breaking out from a coffin partially rotting much to the shock of stan kyle cartman and the new kid despite  depicting him in a darth vaderlike suit his appearance ingame is a zombified version of his normal attire along with the addition of a nazi sash around his arm chef is brought back to life by clyde thanks to toxic waste made by aliens as a zombie nazi as a boss fight at points chef will try biting the new kid only for him to literally knock some sense into him unfortunately clyde shoots the toxic waste from a water gun at chef causing the zombie nazi personality to take over at the end of the fight chef gains control but only briefly as clyde lights him on fire in a last ditch effort to defeat the new kid who had no choice but to use magical farts on chef burning his face off and killing him again chefs dialogue is much like in chefs return comprised of stock audio both from isaac hayes and various speeches from adolf hitler  chef was referenced in  when  mentions a chef person of color who loved to sing soul songs and claims that the children drove him to suicide  corrects him by stating that he was brainwashed by a    imageisaachayesjpgthumb voiced chef from  to  on march    was reported to have quit   over objections to the shows attitudes toward and depiction of various religions claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance  despite the content of the official press release however there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure er and stone assert that he quit due to the controversial   and its treatment of scientology as hayes was a member of the religion series cocreator and writer  commented in a manner that suggested that hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on   we never heard a peep out of isaac in any way until we did scientology he wants a different standard for religions other than his own and to me that is where intolerance and bigotry begin   others have suggested that hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow scientologists and that the decision was not voluntary it was eventually reported however that hayes did not quit the show but that the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him on january   hayes defended  s style of controversial humor to the onions av club and xms opie and anthony show going so far as to note that although he was not pleased with the shows depiction of scientology he understands what matt and trey are doing it was reported that hayes suffered a stroke in the middle of january  and was not in a position to make major decisions for himself  hayes died of a stroke on august   making  chefs final official appearance   aside from   and their families chef was the only africanamerican character in  he was almost always  wearing his chefs hat red shirt and blue pants he was also often  wearing a white apron with the word chef printed on it he appeared to be slightly overweight and had a black beard in  his apron text changes from an uppercase chef to a lowercase chef in one scene  chef seems to have worn a chefs hat for most of his life even when he was not employed as a chef he wore it as a child as  in  and supported by his fathers anecdote in  even when he is employed as an accountant in  his signature hat can be  hanging up in his office however he does not wear it as a young adult in the flashbacks in  or         chefs parents first appeared in  when they came over from  for chefs wedding they told the boys of their many alleged encounters with the loch ness monster and his attempts to swindle  treefiddy out of them by dressing up as a girl scout an alien and even using young chef by posing as his imaginary friend  chefs folks also made another appearance in  where they tried to give cartman more time by extracting kennys soul from inside him chefs mother also offered treefiddy to kenny to go out the window in case the soul got on

five or so seasons in which the word chef on his apron switched from capital to lowercase generally it was lowercase when viewed from the side and capital when viewed from the front due to the boys
