   is a minor character in  class and first appears in the  episode    Kevin was initially a nameless background character who appeared in the boys classroom and made background appearances alongside other fourth graders He has his first speaking role in  where he is referred to as Kevin by Stan Despite being animated the same as the white children he is revealed to be ChineseAmerican in the episode Kevins most notable traits are his Star Wars and Star Trek obsessions seen in   and  Kevin is described by  as the kid who is always screwing up the whole show  He has a small role in  where  recruits Kevin and a few other classmates to become pirates and travel to Somalia and he is critical to taking control of the French vessel that the crew commandeers for the rest of the episode proving they are worthy pirates  While previous appearances had depicted him as a Star Wars fan who was often playing by himself in  and  he was now seen as a Star Trek fan and is shown leading the Federation Kids a clique of kids who play Star Trekthemed games including    He is first referred to by name in  by  as Casey but is referred to by Stan in  as Kevin a name used for many characters in the second season Since then he has consistently been referred to as Kevin   During the thirteenth season a character named  was referred to offscreen in  and it was revealed later in  to be this Kevin    Kevin wears a skyblue jacket with a red collar red gloves and dark blue trousers His hair is black and the style is similar to that of Stans The light blue color of his jacket explains why in the ancient scripts he was written as Sky  s original script for  refers to him as looking like any other kid except he has black hair He is identified in dialogue as having Chinese ancestry but nothing in the animation indicates this  In terms of attractiveness Kevin is ranked  on the rigged list for the cutest boys created by the girls in     Kevins personality is littleknown but he is known for his SciFi obsession which he consistently annoys other characters mainly Cartman with  in  he is wearing a  mask while meeting with the other children in their Lord of the Rings outfits and in  he brings along a green lightsaber instead of a sword as a member of s pirate crew Kevin also has a tendency to ruin the moment for the other children usually with a Star Wars reference This will usually exasperate his classmates but Cartman in particular who will often respond with Kevin god damn it or Kevin Jesus Christ An example is in  where he references Star Trek in an irrelevant situation Let us charge our shields and use photon torpedoes to vaporize the Klingons and Cartman responds Kevin god damn it every fucking time Kevin god fucking damn it seriously This could imply that Kevin isnt only a fan of Star Wars but movies in the scifi genre in general In the entire Black Friday trilogy he plays Spock from Star Trek and in South Park The Stick of Truth he is also seen in the same attire  There is a possibility that gaming might be one of Kevins hobbies in  Kevin was lined up outside a shop to get a PlayStation Portable with several other children Also in  it is shown that he is trying to help defeat the high levelled player though it is impossible to tell which character he is playing as It would not be odd if Kevin liked gaming as he loves Star Wars
