the whole show  he has a small role in  where  recruits kevin and a few other classmates to become pirates and travel to somalia and he is critical to taking control of the french vessel that the crew commandeers for the rest of the  proving they are worthy pirates  while previous appearances had depicted him as a star wars fan who was often playing by himself in  and  he was now  as a star trek fan and is shown leading the federation kids a clique of kids who play star trekthemed games including    he is first referred to by name in  by  as casey but is referred to by stan in  as kevin a

their lord of the rings outfits and in  he brings along a green lightsaber instead of a sword as a member of s pirate crew kevin also has a tendency to ruin the moment for the other children usually with a star wars reference this will usually exasperate his classmates but cartman in particular who will often respond with kevin god damn it or kevin jesus christ an example is in  where he references star trek in an irrelevant situation let us charge our shields and use photon torpedoes to vaporize the klingons and cartman responds kevin god damn it every fucking time kevin god fucking damn it seriously this could imply that kevin isnt only a fan of star wars but movies in the scifi genre in general in the entire black friday trilogy he plays spock from star trek and in   the stick of truth he is also  in the same attire  there is a possibility that gaming might be one of kevins hobbies in  kevin was lined up outside a shop to get a playstation portable with several other children also in  it is shown that he is trying to help defeat the high levelled player though it is impossible to tell which character he is playing as it would not be odd if kevin liked gaming as he

ground despite this kevin has actually aided him on a few occasions cartman greatly despises kevin openly he had no qualms about accepting cartman as a leader on numerous occasions meaning either he is a person who likes to follow orders more than give them is too passive to fight back or he trusts cartman to some extent in  cartman calls the pirate crew meeting at his house with kevin expressing
