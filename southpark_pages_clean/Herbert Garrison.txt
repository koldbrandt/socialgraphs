sexuality claiming to have let truckers do her in their trucks   After she learned she could not have periods or get pregnant Ms Garrison realized she was not actually a woman but it was too late to have the operation undone and she accepted what she was When Ms Garrison learned that Mr Slave was going to marry  she tried to stop the governor from passing the law for gay marriage by having two of

foil the election by making derogatory remarks against women and the TSA during a campaign rally Instead of losing supporters he instead gets chased by an angry mob demanding answers When he finds out

He uses the  to warp reality and turn Mr Service into Mr Hat and manages to return to being the teacher for the th grade students   As rd and th grade teacher Mr Garrison teaches a rather incompetent class The students in his classroom never pay attention and instead chat with each other while he is giving a lesson While the children do occasionally receive punishment for slacking off such as Stan having to read an embarrassing note that Bebe passed up to him in front of the whole class in  they never learn from their mistakes and usually repeated the behavior  Mr Garrison is also noted for his class showing no concern for his wellbeing In  when he announces that the school is considering firing him on grounds that he does not teach his class about current events the students have no problem with it Additionally in  Kyle even tells the  that they have no respect for Garrison when she tells the kids to treat her the same way they treat him  Despite this however Stan Kyle and Wendy go out of their way to visit him at the mental home and tell him that they hope he is able to come back to school soon and teach again in    Garrison wears dark green pants a green jacket and black shoes He also wears blackframed eyeglasses He is mostly bald with gray hair on the sides  As a woman she tailored his jacket into a tanktop wore lipstick and gold earrings similar to s as well as shorter pants and new white shoes Her hair remained the same however bald spot and all  After becoming male again in  Garrison wears an outfit identical to the original one with the only exception being a belt added to the pants and a very minor change to his collar Mr Garrison is also lefthanded His hair was brown as seen in  but in  as a kid his hair is grey but he may have dyed it for the party in  though Ms Garrison is highly renowned in the future as the symbol of Atheism but this was prevented from happening by Cartman in   In  Mr Garrisons appearance changed to include an artificial tan and a hairstyle resembling that of  since he substitutes Trump for the Republican candidate for the presidential election As President of the United States Garrison wore a darkblue suit with a red tie and white shirt In  he is shown to no longer wear his glasses in his Twitter picture though he wears them again in  suggesting he only takes them off for pictures  After losing the election and returning to South Park in  Garrisons appearance returns to its original state with a few changes His design now includes a belt and a slightly altered shirt      suffers from many psychological problems that are touched many times throughout the show though it appears nothing is ever done about it The most noticeable of his problems are multiple identity disorder represented through various puppets At the beginning of the series while Mr Garrison still taught Third Grade he held a puppet on his hand known as  Mr Garrison used this puppet to show a second more aggressive personality and to emote some of his most inner conflicts One of these conflicts being the fact he was gay and his inability to come to terms with that It was hinted many times that he was gay but Mr Garrison would take deep offense and insist he was straight He would say Mr Hat was gay and later admitted his secondhand puppet  was also gay Mr Garrison denied the fact he was gay so much that he even appeared homophobic and believed gay people were an abomination and were not human In one particular episode he tells Stan Gay people are evil Their hearts pump not blood like yours and mine but rather a thick vomitous oil  Garrison is very outspoken often campaigning to have changes made that he feels are right or to block other peoples ideals and can be considered heavily opinionated During certain seasons and on occasion he will slur the last part of a word in a sentence especially when he is saying something in emphasis  Mr Garrison is racist first shown as a gag for Mr Hankey the Christmas Poo where he proposes the town gets rid of all the  every Christmas which he again suggests in  to which  angrily replies Mr Garrison every year you suggest that and every year we tell you NO When rich black people were moving to South Park he was able to gather the towns men into getting rid of them under the pretense that the rich people were taking over the town He got people to dress up like ghosts to scare them away and burned lower case Ts on the black peoples lawns standing for Time to Leave Once the town was rid of the rich people FilethumbleftMr Garrison and his lover Mr Slave Mr Garrison said they could all get rich by selling the houses This confused the town folk who replied that they would then become what they did not want in the town Mr Garrison then exposed his true motive by saying Well at least we got rid of those damn nig and the episode cuts to black and the credits roll Mr Garrison was also seen among a  group but said he was not a member but Mr Hat was again using his puppet to dispute the conflicts inside himself Mr Garrison appears to be on good terms with  though a black man who works at the school and was even at his funeral  Mr Garrison is an incompetent teacher who teaches his students useless things such as why Chubby Checker left  and once spent a whole week of just showing his class old  tapes He has also taught his students a few times subjects far too advanced for them like Joseph Stalin and communism There have only been a few instances mostly in more recent episodes when Mr Garrison has been portrayed as more competent as of a teacher taught a normal subject for a Fourth Grade class many instances being after his sex change to a woman and back to a man mostly Times Tables Yet he goes about it by insulting the kids when they get an answer wrong which is often It is possible that Mr Garrison teaches the students more about pop culture because he himself does not know a lot about the school curriculum or just does not pay attention to it  One of Mr Garrisons common personality traits since giving up Mr Hat is how his aggressive behavior now causes him to take things to the extremes When he came out as gay he began performing extremely vulgar homosexual acts with Mr Slave Of course part of this was most likely because of the fact he wanted to get fired in order to sue the school However after becoming a woman he became obsessed with declaring how much of a woman he was in the loudest and again most vulgar way For example he once shouted loudly to other women about how wonderful it was to have a period Later when Mrs Garrison begins a brief relationship with Richard Dawkins she gives up her religious faith due to the fact the Dawkins found her attractive and then became obnoxiously vocal about Atheism to the point of being fanatical The same held true for when Mrs Garrison decided to become a lesbian following a onenight stand with another woman Following the encounter Mrs Garrison began to sexually harass all the women at the local lesbian bar and became obsessed with the idea of having random sex with women These extreme shifts and stances of belief mixed with his already aggressive behavior make it to where Garrison is often verbally abusive to any and all who disagree with him All of this suggests that he is an extreme narcissist  Due to the fact that Mr Garrison has had both male and female relationships during the course of the series it is now unclear whether or not he can or should still be considered gay but rather pansexual Since Garrisons last relationship was lesbian in nature prior to returning to being a male it has not been made clear what Garrisons current orientation is It was once implied during earlier episodes that Garrison might have had sex with Cartmans pet pig  meaning he may also enjoy bestiality In addition  also suggests that same idea when the people are watching the  and Garrison suggests that they let him keep the Jakovasaur They replied that he once found a bird that he kept at  to keep it alive but he ended up having sex with it to which Garrison replies that the bird was a total slut and then he tells everyone who did not have sex with the bird to raise their hands and everyone raises their hands a reference to   Perhaps the most appropriate description of his orientation is in  when Chef states that there is a big difference between being gay and being Mr Garrison suggesting that he believes Mr Garrison is a pervert Mr Garrison may also be a  as he was shown attempting to hook up with young boys in   Since returning to male gender in  Mr Garrisons behavior as of lad has been shown to be less eccentric than before having been involved in no acts of deviant sexual behavior outrageous outbursts or psychotic episodes Instead he is behaved more or less like a responsible and sane teacher The closest exceptions to this has been when he offered up his students as hostages in  and being afraid along with all the other Republican members of South Park that it was the end of the world after  was elected president in  he still did teach the curriculum however One example of this is teaching them about Game of thrones in   But his weird behavior returned in the  episode  he is fired from his teaching job after he verbally bashes South Parks many Canadian immigrants He begins a political campaign to get rid of all the Canadians by fucking them all to death After traveling to Canada and doing this to the Canadian president he decides to go to Washington DC to run for President with  as his running mate possibly because they are both transgender   Throughout the seasons Mr Garrison has had four teaching assistants The first of these was  It was through this puppet that Mr Garrison channeled deep emotions through him he was afraid to show like the fact he was gay Mr Garrison would use Mr Hat to voice things he himself would never have said at the beginning of the show Mr Hat was gay and racist according to Mr Garrison who he himself denied being Mr Hat was able to do things without the help of Mr Garrison which makes many people wonder if Mr Hat does have a mind of his own Some of those instances are when Mr Hat drove a car through a prison wall to rescue Mr Garrison and Chef and he has blinked and moved his eyes around a few times Mr Garrison had a debate with Mr Hat about whether or not to go to a  meeting and when Mr Garrison refused Mr Hat disappeared from the room He has also shown he has had Mr Hat since he was a young boy   Mr Garrison replaced Mr Hat with a new hand puppet  Mr Twig is a twig wearing the same shirt as Mr Hat and spoke in the same voice until his final episode where he spoke in a French accent although since Mr Twigs final speech to Mr Garrison was romantic in nature it may have been simply a joke Mr Garrisons students did not receive Mr Twig well and wanted Mr Hat back Mr Garrison insisted Mr Hat would never be coming back In the episode  Mr Twig kept on ending up in unfortunate accidents Mr Garrison soon discovered they were being caused by Mr Hat who wanted him to take him back At the end of the episode Mr Twig helped Garrison realize that Mr Hat was the best choice and Mr Garrison discarded him and Mr Twig has not been seen since  In  Garrison learns that he can sue the education board for a lot of money if he is fired for being gay and does his best to ensure this happens He hires his then boyfriend  as his teaching assistant or teachers ass  His classes become increasingly sexual and degenerate in nature culminating in Mr Garrison inserting the class gerbil  into Mr Slaves rectum  In the episode  Mr Garrison is forced by  and his handturnedconartistpuppet  to pull Mr Hat out of storage so as to reveal the truth about his father who until recently was believed to be Cartmans mother  Garrison is initially dismissive of using the old puppet saying he no longer needed it However Mitch greets Mr Hat claiming they are old friends and war buddies and as the conversation between Mr Garrison Cartman and Mitch progresses Garrison seems to regress back to talk with and to Mr Hat as if the puppet is alive  In  Mr Garrison is given a secret service agent  because he previously served as President of the United States Towards the end of the episode Mr Service is digitally manipulated into Mr Hat by the Hollywood Elites   Mr Garrison has committed numerous misdemeanors and felonies throughout the series Assault In  she attacks the Persian representative sent to the LesBos lesbian bar to negotiate by kicking

Bestiality Implied to have had sex with Cartmans pet pig and a pigeon in the episodes  and  Indirect Mass MurderBiological TerrorismAttempted Genocide In  Mr Garrison intentionally hinders  any progress to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic because he sees it as a way to kill off Mexicans He ignores the immoral nature of this as he is committing indirect mass murder and the fact that the pandemic is affecting the entire country and the world itself Later when scientists finally reacquire the pangolin needed to study and help develop a potential vaccine for Coronavirus Garrison shows up with a flame thrower and uses it to kill the pangolin and scientist condemning the world so he can succeed with his twisted personal agenda   Mr Garrison has had both male and female relationships before during and after his sex change because of this it is unclear what his sexuality is it is likely that he is bisexual   Mr Garrison starts dating Mr Slave in  this relationship lasted until his sex change operation in  They had a falling out in  where Mr at the time Ms Garrison tried to sabotage Mr Slaves and s wedding Its hinted in  that Garrison might still have some feelings for Slave   Richard Dawkins was Ms Garrisons first boyfriend since the sexchange operation This relationship was formed in  when Richard asks her on a date He also successfully converted her to Atheism though this was probably just said because she was afraid to lose the first man who has found her attractive in the future they get married and rid the world of religion however thanks to  who uses the   to contact Mr Garrison he reveals to Richard the truth about the sex change operation and doing so proceeds Richard to break up with her and runs out of the house in disgust   Allison was one of the women who Ms Garrison experimented with in  and officially made her a lesbian it is unclear if they were dating or just friends with benefits however after the events of the episode it may be clear that they never spoke again   Mr Garrison does not have many interactions with the boys outside his role of teacher he usually shows annoyance toward them and frequently talks to them in a very vulgar way Sometimes however they can show sympathy toward each other In  he shows concerns for Stan when he saw that he has a black eye thinking that his parents beat him but when Stan is explaining to him

women he is shown having a preference for both sexes He may or may not have had sexual intercourse with  as both of them were revealed to be regular visitors to  bathhouse in  however this could have been where he met  He is probably fond of bestiality as it was implied in  and  that he has had sex with a pigeon and Cartmans pet pig Mr Garrison appears to be quite fond of  as in the episode  he is seen trying to bring food to Kenny in the hospital but gets arrested  is known to be a racist member of KKK in  and Mr Garrison stays out of the KKK and apologizes to an irate  for Mr Hats involvement However in  Garrison seems to be racist as well He is also spotted during town FilethumbMs Garrison leading the riot in meetings suggesting to get rid of all the Mexicans as shown in  and  When Mr Garrison shows off his new boobs in  while grotesque looking they are more or less equal in shape and size However in  when he reveals them again they are even more misshapen with one being notably smaller than the other This may be due to one of them being damaged in  Mr Garrison carries a gun with him to class it is unknown why and it also unknown why he did not use it when his whole class was held hostage in Pioneer Village in  although it could have been confiscated by the staff at school the robbers or he may have simply forgotten to bring it Despite his sexchange and several seasons as
