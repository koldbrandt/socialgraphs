with his role continuing through the story arcs second part  and he appears in the arcs conclusion  where he plays a crucial role During the first two episodes he is unable to say exactly what his power is  this was first brought up by  who suggested that he add something to the costume Bradley said Milk He is left behind to guard the base when the others go to the hotel fire Eventually when everyone follows the disgraced Coon outside where  who had risen and sided with the Coon over the course of the story is waiting for them he runs away and escapes exile to the Sunken City of RLyeh  uses his power to escape and Bradley follows Mysterion to where Cthulhu is massacring a  concert A message then arrives from space for GokZarah who turns out to be Bradley  it informs him that he too has a power and was sent to Earth as a result of his parents being missing Bradley uses his newfound powers over Mint and Berry to defeat Cthulhu close the rift between Earth and RLyeh and incarcerate Cartman He then leaves to track down his parents However in the beginning of the story none of the other Coon friends believed he had a superpower and the revelation of his powers surprised everyone Also Bradleys last name was revealed in  to be Biggle Since then he only made a few cameo appearances all of them with his normal identity   He is an alien who wears a human disguise with pale skin and blonde bowlcut hair with a cowlick sticking up at the back of his head He also wears a navy blue sweater with red mittens and blue jeans    Bradley seems to be bright and very active He has his major appearances in   and  Until then though he usually only appeared as a background character Bradley is the true identity of Mintberry Crunch later identified as GokZarah As Mintberry Crunch he was bullied by  until he discovered his power whereupon he put the Coon in a dog crate with  While he has had occasional speaking roles he never really spoke until the Coon and Friends episodes  Bradley also appears to possess a kind heart as can be seen in  where he tried to stop Coon from beating Mosquito and ended up getting scratched Another example can be seen in  where Bradley is the only one who tried to stop  from provoking Cthulhu and sacrificing himself in exchange for their friends   Bradley was apparently adopted by the Biggles However he is actually an alien sent to Earth by his birth parents after the collision of the Mint and Berry worlds Little is known about his real family other than their home planets name was    Bradleys mother has been shown to be very nice and caring for her children It is unknown how or when she took Bradley in as her own child but this factor does not seem to cause any difficulties in their relationship She tries to get her children to get along by asking her daughter Henrietta to spend some time with her brother it seems that she is oblivious to Henriettas disdain towards Bradley   The relationship between Bradley and Henrietta is rocky to say the least Henrietta finds her little brother to be an annoying twerp and Bradley in return is scared of her Despite relying on her at times to keep him company Bradley would like to gain the upper hand on his sister and he eventually did when he rubbed her face in it after discovering his powers He returned to their home only to call her fat and flip her off suggesting an utter dislike for her    Little is known about his birth father However when things got too dangerous for his son an image of him appeared before Bradley to tell him about his origins the planet Koh Kajan and powers His appearance seems to be based on the singer Limahl who was most famous for singing the theme to the  movie adaptation of The NeverEnding Story   Bradleys sister Henrietta talked about her father and aunt when she was first introduced From her description we hear that Bradleys adopted father is an alcoholic and his aunt is a drug addict This however may not be true as Henrietta seems to overexaggerate or make false claims about her loved ones because she likes to see things negatively  Bradleys alien father also states that his son also had an alien mother however it is unknown what happened to her or if she is still alive    Bradley often follows Cartmans schemes such as capturing Kyle in  In the Coon and Friends episodes Bradley annoys Cartman who bullies Bradley in response because of his Mintberry Costume Cartman got annoyed of him saying phrases such as Lets pack the Gulf full of flavor Bradley is also scared of Cartman because he can easily beat him up he got beaten up by Cartman in  when they were going to the grocery store But in  at the end of the episode Bradley defeated  and put  in the same prison where  was incarcerated throughout the trilogy He also realizes he has his own powers of Mint and Berry whenever he says Shabalogoo In the beginning Cartman did not seem to understand his powers either   Bradley and Esther were paired up in  Bradley and Esther were also part of the  choir in  It also seems that they could also be seen together in the background so it is possible that he and Esther are either a couple or very close friends  A picture of Esther can be found in Bradleys room in the video game  implying he has a possible romantic interest in her   Bradley transforms into  by spinning around and invoking the magic word Shablagoo When asked by  what his powers were he replied The power of mint and berries with a satisfying tasty crunch He is later shown able to shower enemies with berries as well as mint His other powers include flight superhuman strength to the point of easily dragging  by a tentacle generating a berry force field and teleporting in a splash of berries   In  Bradleys voice was done by Jesse
