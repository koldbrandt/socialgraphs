antagonist hussein continues his romantic relationship with satan as he plans to conquer the world by taking advantage of satans power as ruler also in the film it was stated at the start that he got

position of power over satan to launch an invasion of earth after the americancanadian war made it possible for him to enter and his demons briefly manage to take over the world us soldiers tried to

manipulative character that he embodies in   he even convinces  that he could not possibly be building chemical weapons in heaven despite the fact that he himself admits his cover up for the plant a chocolate chip factory is easily seethrough  in  pictures of saddam are  on some buildings when  is flying around iraq  he is also one of the forms the alien  takes in   he also appeared in  in which  called the attention of all the bad guys in  including hussein     his sidekick  and others he recommends killing all the infidels as opposed to getting rid of  although it is unknown how he returned to earth from heaven god may have discovered his cookie factory was a cover for weapons of mass destruction exiled him to earth  in  hussein  as the man in a shallow alcove behind a curtain controlling the prime minister of canada in a dual reference to the great oz of the wizard of oz and his real life hiding from the us infantry in a pit under a tent he makes many new unnecessarily hateful and eccentric laws including one that forced ike to leave the us and move to canada the boys travel to canada to get ike back coming across several other people who were affected by saddams laws when they finally reach saddam he kills kenny with lasers and refuses to give ike back to his brother when kyle asks what the hell is wrong with you what kind of prime minister bases all his decisions on hatred he is unveiled as the prime minister of canada and is promptly arrested by canadian soldiers he is last  being paraded through a city on a float with the canadians celebrating his capture similar to how iraqis spontaneously took to the streets after his real life capture  if you look very carefully in  when it shows the reporter from the middle east you can see a portrait of hussein in the background   saddam hussein  as any other canadian character except his head is a cut out of the real person he has a floppy head a highpitched voice and wears dark gray pants a dark brown military jacket and black shoes  in the   his face is picture of him with damaged skin and messy hair and beard after he was dragged from a hideyhole some days before the  aired    saddam hussein on   has mannerisms that differ from the real saddam firstly he speaks english only secondly he talks in a whiny high pitched voice and thirdly he is homosexual he also is shown to be very manipulative often accomplishing his tasks fairly easily due to the stupidity of nearly everyone around him even god and satan at times  he often creates diabolical schemes to take over the world most prominently in the film where he manipulated his boyfriend satan into invading earth just so saddam could push him aside and assume control of the world himself he also organizes a gambit to invade canada sneaking his soldiers through the airlines in  and apparently built a chemical weapons plant to take over the world in   his most recent plot was to become the prime minister of canada by tricking the canadians he becomes the prime minister for a short time but is defeated when the boys find out who he really is and canadian soldiers arrest him  saddam  to be very sadistic as evidenced by his torture of kenny in  he is heavily implied to have a sexual fetish for it similarly saddam  to be very sexcrazed he satisfies both his lust for power and his sex cravings by being in a homosexual relationship with satan whom he is very abusive towards  as shown in  and  his first instinct when his relationship with satan is threatened when satan finds a new much kinder  is to murder said boyfriend and his first reaction after satan breaks up with him is to constantly stalk him  he is a selfproclaimed psychopath as evidenced in his song  which contained the following lyrics i like to kill i like to maim but its ok because i can change during which he kills a dancer by breaking her back he also apparently had abusive parents as evidenced by other lyrics from the same song  its not my fault that im so evil its society society you see my parents were sometimes abusive and it made a prick of me during these lyrics caricatures of saddams parents are  physically abusing their infant son  saddam also is depicted as very power hungry greedy and dishonest on one occasion he is shown to be a religious extremist as evidenced by his line in  where he recommends death to the infidels as opposed to getting rid of    heeeeeeyyyyy relax guy where was i gonna go detroit  us government representative mr hussein the us government is becoming worried  saddam worried aboot what take a load off relax  representative you seem to be taking over canada  saddam taking over canada me hey you need a rest fella im not hiding any bombs  representative we didnt say anything about bombs  saddam oh you didnt hey relax   it is rumored by some us soldiers that the real saddam hussein was shown the film  while on trial for genocidecrimes against humanity as a form of torture he is voiced by matt stone but in the end credits it says he was voiced by himself saddam was the second celebrity whose head was used on the body of an animated   character right after david hasselhoff in the   he pronounces about as aboot this combined with his canadian style head and his habit of saying relax guyfriend when people suspect him implies that he is canadian in some way however in other s he pronounces about as about and does not have a canadian accent the cause for saddams death changes every time it is mentioned in the series  the film states he was killed by a pack wild boars while in  and george bush claims us assassins took him out he also was claimed to have died from a chemical gas attack by the canadians in  however this  is shown as a fictional showwithinashow in the s  and  saddam was described by satan once as fucking crazy considering this is satan this is fairly ironic although satan has been shown as considerably nicer and more sensitive than he is depicted in other media when saddam hussein first appeared on   he was still the dictator of iraq making his appearance as satans boyfriend rather surreal especially the first time they aired although saddam is  s biggest and most dangerous villain and a real person and celebrity he does not appear in  or  saddam is referenced a few times as the iraqi dictator instead of satans boyfriend in  an image of hussein is  in the room where  is being tortured by the iraqis the prowar guy sings a song about americas need to fight saddam hussein in  in   tells a joke about how saddam fell but the price of gas did not in the commentary track for s bluray release  mentions that they had an idea to bring back saddam in  however this never came to fruition saddam initially started out as the films secondary antagonist and satans henchman  however this is no longer true because satan has reformed later on leaving saddam to usurp him and become the true main villain in the long run saddam was found in a pit beneath a tent hovel on december   in the town of addawr iraq near tikrit as the conclusion of the us military operation red dawn  his face in  is from the images circulating in the news and added to the final cut  days before airtime the plot elements of him hiding behind a curtain and people parading after his capture are from real life saddam hussein died in real life about a month after  aired meaning that  could be saddams last appearance     dies from a chemical gas attack   along with satan saddam welcomes jesuss producer to hell   serves as the main antagonist   tries to get back together with satan   satan banishes him to heaven   he creates weapons of mass destruction in heaven    as one of s forms and shown in live action form in the earth tv show   joins a group of super
