the s  and  since the demise of  token and his parents were the only regular africanamerican characters on the show until  however it is implied that token and his family are more wealthy than much of the towns white residents with token even living more luxurious than the other white kids who play baseball with pinecones and sticks in the     is the most obvious source of provocation towards token when cartman decides to make a christian rock group he immediately went to token and demanded that token get the bass guitar out of his basement token offended responded that he did not own a bass and did not know how to play it anyways cartman shoots back that because he is black he of course owns one and knows how to play it much to tokens annoyance cartman was right on both counts  another incident of cartmans somewhat racist behavior occurred in  as the boys were making a news show  cartman tells token to change his voice for presenting because it sounded too black or ethnic token does so and puts on an overly pompous white stereotype voice in the   when cartman and the gang try to become tokens agents to get  of prize money from a talent show he was entering cartman stated now youre probably wondering hell why do i need to give you guys ten percent in a stereotypically affected voice  in  his codename is blackie occasionally however there are times where cartman does something perceived as racist without the intent behind it such as when he threw a rock at token because token called him fat in   in  while the other boys have their faces camouflaged black his is

realized that he could never understand how it feels to hear the word from an africanamericans viewpoint  in  tyler perry makes a guest appearance as madea for jimmys comedy awards and token is the only character shown laughing at his jokes this suggests a stereotype that african americans are the only group that finds madea entertaining  in  cartman stays at tokens house to hide from whoever is killing his dolls convinced that since token is black no one would dare attack him there because it would supposedly be a sign of racism  in  cartman attempts to force a romantic relationship between token and  believing black people should be together although his intentions were insincere the two do become a couple and were quite happy with each other   music  despite never having previously touched the instrument token is shown to be highly skilled with the bass guitar as  in the   however he is annoyed by this talent as cartman tells him it is hereditary due to his ethnicity  he also has an excellent singing voice as  in the   he sang the lou rawls song  for the ms colorado beauty pageant and won  cartman also attributes his vocal skills to his ethnicity however he eventually lost his money when he hired an exploitative agent and wound up serving drinks at s sons wedding  he also sang a ballad  in  but did not sound nearly as impressive as he does in wing this is because his performance in wing was actually a spedup version of the original lou rawls track while his performance in here comes the neighborhood was performed by his standard voice actor   fighting near the end

has short black hair  in the future timeline set in  he has grown a full beard he wears a dark gray jacket over a purple collared shirt and navy blue pants     token is usually levelheaded calm and rational he has also been shown to be highly intelligent besides kyle however this has caused cartman to label him a smartass  he has a strong willingness to stand up for himself and his rights in  he was obviously incredibly upset by s dad  saying the nword on wheel of fortune and did not forgive stan until the latter admitted that he would never be able to understand the connotations of the word  he was also annoyed by cartmans constant racial stereotyping in  but managed to contain his frustrations and continued to work with him however he eventually lost his temper with cartman physically assaulting him for saying fuck jesus in front of a huge crowd of christian fans  in  he took the other kids teasing personally causing him to feel like an outcast and not part of the group possibly
