Cartman throws a rock at him giving him a black eye However because Token is an African American the FBI assumes this was a racist act Cartman is tried in a federal court and convicted of a hate crime and was sentenced to juvenile prison  After realizing that they had no chance against the girls without Cartmans fat ass  and  go to Tokens house and ask him to help them get Cartman out of prison The boys then put on a presentation before the governor complete with visual aids in which they detail their opposition to hate crime laws declaring it as savage hypocrisy  They argue that all forms of crime warrant some sort of hate and the laws serve only to encourage discrimination further impressing the governor and securing Cartmans release Cartman returns home arriving at the sled race just as they are about to begin and helps the boys beat the girls   Token had another major role in  Token is being teased by his friends for being rich For example he was teased by the kids of South Park for having a DVD player and not knowing what a VHS was or for having clothes from Armani Exchange Token sick of constantly being teased decides to try and blend in going to buy clothes at the local JMart

and go off to play polo Token downtrodden says to himself I dont fit in anywhere  Token then goes to the zoo and asks  if he could try fit in with the lions who inexplicably happen to be really into practical jokes and physical comedy However after he fails to understand the lions humor he realizes that he still does not fit in with them However in the end his friends told Token they were just ripping on him which is just what kids do to each other and that he had always been part of the group from the beginning  FilethumbpxToken with  and  as  In  Token joins Cartmans new Christian rock band  Cartman asserted that Token being black automatically meant that he would own and be capable of playing the bass guitar Although initially skeptical and annoyed with Cartmans racial profiling

super pissed off at Stans dad  for saying the Nword on  Stan exacerbates the situation by claiming that he understood fully how the word was hurtful to black people a claim Token would never accept

theme based around Token such as in the episodes  and  Since the demise of  Token and his parents were the only regular AfricanAmerican characters on the show until  However it is implied that Token and his family are more wealthy than much of the towns white residents with Token even living more luxurious than the other white kids who play baseball with pinecones and sticks in the episode    is the most obvious source of provocation towards Token When Cartman decides to make a Christian rock group he immediately went to Token and demanded that Token get the bass guitar out of his basement Token offended responded that he did not own a bass and did not know how to play it anyways Cartman shoots back that because he is black he of course owns one and knows how to play it Much to Tokens annoyance Cartman was right on both counts  Another incident of Cartmans somewhat racist behavior occurred in  As the boys were making a news show  Cartman tells Token to change his voice for presenting because it sounded too black or ethnic Token does so and puts on an overly pompous white stereotype voice In the episode  when Cartman and the gang try to become Tokens agents to get  of prize money from a talent show he was entering Cartman stated Now youre probably wondering Hell why do I need to give you guys ten percent in a stereotypically affected voice  In  his codename is

an answer on  He eventually forgave Stan when the latter realized that he could never understand how it feels to hear the word from an AfricanAmericans viewpoint  In  Tyler Perry makes a guest appearance as Madea for Jimmys comedy awards and Token is the only character shown laughing at his jokes This suggests a stereotype that African Americans are the only group that finds Madea entertaining  In  Cartman stays at Tokens house to hide from whoever is killing his dolls convinced that since Token is black no one would dare attack him there because it would supposedly be a sign of racism  In  Cartman attempts to force a romantic relationship between Token and  believing black people should be together Although his intentions were insincere the two do become a couple and were quite happy with each other   Music  Despite never having previously touched the instrument Token is shown to be highly skilled with the bass guitar as seen in the episode  However he is annoyed by this talent as Cartman tells him it is hereditary due to his ethnicity  He also has an excellent singing voice as seen in the episode  He sang the Lou Rawls song  for the Ms Colorado Beauty Pageant and won  Cartman also attributes his vocal skills to his ethnicity However he eventually lost his money when he hired an exploitative agent and wound up serving drinks at s sons wedding  He also sang a ballad  in  but did not sound nearly as impressive as he does in Wing This is because his performance in Wing was actually a spedup version of the original Lou Rawls track while his performance in

grown a full beard He wears a dark gray jacket over a purple collared shirt and navy blue pants     Token is usually levelheaded calm and rational He has also been shown to be highly intelligent besides Kyle However this has caused Cartman to label him a smartass  He has a strong willingness to stand up for himself and his rights in  he was obviously incredibly upset by s dad  saying the Nword on Wheel of Fortune and did not forgive Stan until the latter admitted that he would never be able to understand the connotations of the word  He was also annoyed by Cartmans constant racial stereotyping in  but managed to contain his frustrations and continued to work with him However he eventually lost his temper with Cartman physically assaulting him for saying Fuck Jesus in front of a huge crowd of Christian fans  In  he took the other kids teasing personally causing him to feel like an outcast and not part of the group possibly indicating that he is sensitive to social criticism

Token for being rich  On the other hand Token did agree to help Cartman with his Christian rock band  in  but only because he was promised money Cartman believed that because Token is black he should both own and be able to play a bass guitar instinctively He was right and Token was even able to play it despite never picking up the instrument before much to his own frustration  In the same episode Token stated that he was getting sick of Cartmans stereotypes but nonetheless continued to play for Cartman After Token called Cartman tubby Cartman privately promised himself that he would kill Token
