a regular character however he now only dies occasionally in most of the s in the tenth and eleventh seasons he tends to recede into the background though this tendency seems to have ended with the  throughout the tenth twelfth eighteenth nineteenth twentieth and twentythird seasons kenny did not die once kenny died three times in total in  five times in  and once in seasons    and     like many of   s characters kenny is based on a real person in this case a childhood friend of trey ers also named kenny in a  interview trey said that the rea life kenny was the poorest kid in the neighborhood and wore an orange a that made it difficult for anyone to understand what he was saying trey also stated that real life kenny would skip school from time to time causing the others to jokingly say he had died and a few days later he would join his classmates and attend school againcite weburl er and matt stone interview    in some s kenny is known to do some crimes on his own but not very often in part due to him usually being selfless albeit somewhat lecherous  he has been arrested four times  once for prostitution in which he gave  a hummer for ten bucks once for participating in stans whale wars crew once for illegally downloading music and once for vigilantism however he never stays in prison for long since the town is full of idiots he may not actually have been arrested in  because in a deleted scene it shows that kyle posed as mysterion so kenny would not get in trouble kennys criminal record includes but is not limited to murder by proxy kenny teams up with cartman to have  murdered in  resulting in her getting shot by a hunter they eventually shift the blame to  copyright infringement in  he downloads songs illegally causing him stan and kyle to be arrested attempted murder in  kenny attempts to kill cartman at the nascar championships for ruining the sports reputation  however his sniper rifle got confiscated by a security guard upon entry and cartman had murdered many people it is unknown how kenny obtained the sniper rifle as minors cannot use sniper rifles without a license and presence of an adult let alone with the intention of committing a crime

rid of the baby she is pregnant with in  when he and the boys are roleplaying as ninjas he throws a ninja star into butters eye drastically injuring him in the process filing a false police report in  he lies to the police about his parents abusing him cannibalism in  kenny started taking bites out of anyone and everyone turning them into zombies since he was a zombie himself however this would be forgivable kidnapping in  kenny along with stan and kyle took cartman from the hospital for the purpose of him entering the bullriding contest at the rodeo cartman had not actually healed and thought he was a vietnamese prostitute called ming lee since this was for the purpose of money it would be considered illegal violation of firearm laws the sniper rifle kenny carried is definitely illegal and unregistered it was never explained how kenny obtained the sniper rifle but it is likely he obtained during the events of  when he attempted to kill cartman after he ruined the  sports reputation breaking and entering in  kenny along with the boys broke into the rich kids houses to trick their parents into giving them money and steal it off of them in  kenny along with butters and  assisted stan in breaking into s house to remove his kidney later in  along with stan and kyle kenny broke into cartmans house to teach him a lesson in  he broke into cartmans house again to use the cats in which cartman was taking care of and get high from their urine again underage smokingdrug abuse in  kenny started smoking along with the boys to avoid being like  later in  kenny became addicted to cheesing and when cats became illegal he ignores the law and continues to get high he eventually stopped but began to get high again after smelling some strong flowers in  he takes cocainelike alien

burn the whole school down in  kenny still kindergartener along with the boys were trying to play firemen they decided that they should start a fire so they had their classmate  start the fire and when they try to urinate out the fire it eventually got worse and burned the entire school down but put the blame on trent prostitution in  while promoting the  kenny competed with  and  to see who would give  a hummer for the least amount of money kenny was willing to go for  which forced knoxville and green to submit and he was eventually arrested and jailed for prostitution forcing a lookalike to do the final stunt and as a result die on the show framingblackmailing in  kenny along with the boys framed  for starting the fire which he did however kenny kyle stan and cartman are responsible for making the fire worse which caused the school to burn down and gave  severe burns in  while in  kenny took a picture of the two head  sucking on each others jagons and sticking their fingers in each others thrushers kenny and the others later used it against them which saved the world so it would be forgivable pedophilia in  during the ending kenny takes full possession of  while possessed he attempted to kiss  which caused   civilians unaware that he was being possessed to think he was a pedophile however this action was shown in the form of a commercial possibly indicating that this was in fact just a scene from a rob schneider movie vigilantism in  before his identity was revealed he took the role of mysterion later after defeating both  and  with the help from the  who was trying to get rid of mysterion mysterion attempted to remove his mask since he cannot risk putting peoples lives in danger with every villain wondering who he is after some deliberation he reveals himself and gets arrested much to the coons pleasure despite people pleading with him not to although this may have been  because in a deleted scene it is shown that kyle pretended to be mysterion so that the real mysterion would not get in trouble he reappeared as mysterion again in   where his identity is revealed to the viewers  and  underage oral sex in  kenny had oral sex with his girlfriend  after they stop wearing their  in  indecent exposure in season  he joins butters  and constantly pulls his pants down and reveals his genitals publicly fraud in  kenny along with the

also  and   filethumbleftkenny dies in  kenny mccormick is best known in the show for his recurring death in nearly every  of the first five seasons often followed by some variant of  and you bastards from his friends  and  respectively the gag has many precedents going back at least as far as the regular cry you rotten swine youve deaded me by bluebottle voiced by peter sellers in the goon show in  in the first few s kyle said the entire phrase later on it varied depending on who killed kenny kenny has died and come back over  times in the franchise  in the series to date two in the early animated shorts six in other authorized tv parodies six times in the video game and twice in the movie filethumbrightkenny struck by lightning in  he has also been killed nine different ways in the opening sequence kennys most recent death was in season fifteen   when he is mauled by a  kenny died in almost all the s until the writers killed him off permanently in the fifth season in  but he returned at the end of the next seasons finale  remarking that he has just been over there pointing offscreen  although he does not appear in    or  he technically is in them as cartman mixed his ashes with milk and drank it causing his soul to be trapped inside of him by the sixth season matt and trey got rid of the practice of killing him in every  they got tired of the joke the reason why kenny died continuously was given in an interview with matt stone and trey er who stated vaguely that it was because kenny is poor kenny is always resurrected for the next  although the explanations for his reappearance varied in  it is explained that his soul returns to his mother takes to another body is reborn and then grows to be  or  years old in record time and somehow retaining physical appearance and memories while another simply had kenny magically reappearing out of thin air in the second part of the twopart   after he was run over by a train in the first the most recent explanation comes from the   in which kenny himself reveals he is unable to stay dead and always wakes up in bed eventually while nobody else remembers his death however in the next   it is confirmed that while he may wake up in his bed it is indeed his mother that gives birth to him every time kennys immortality may be connected with the  as carol mutters under her breath i knew we should have never gone to those cult meetings  filethumbleftkennys funeral in   none of the other characters seem to find this at all unusual stan merely greeted kenny when he materialized and no one else even blinked kenny himself is aware of the fact that he is constantly killed expressing resentment over the fact that stan was worried about kyles impending death while never mourning kenny and opting to take home economics classes over wood shop partly because he was afraid of getting killed by the dangerous power tools in the shop class and cheering after realizing he had survived the   in  kennys will states in the highly likely event of my death in  he says to hindsight nobody even remembers me dying i go to school the next day and everyone is just like oh hey kenny even if they had  me get decapitated with their own eyes this would suggest that kenny is fully aware of his deaths but nobody else is in  and  kenny points out that nobody can remember his deaths he even shoots himself in the head after a desperate plea to his friends to try and remember this time but to no avail  filethumbleftkennys funeral in  other characters occasionally seem to be vaguely aware of kennys deaths in  kenny dies in cartmans theme  and when the lawyers suing him mention that boy who died cartman replies with who kenny he dies all the time it would seem that the others are also aware of kennys deaths but are quite nonchalant about them since they know he will reappear stan and kyle say their oh my god they killed kenny lines like they do not care in  in which the gnomes accidentally crush kenny and mourn over this tragedy but are confused as to why the kids do not seem to care in  kenny eats antacid tablets thinking they were mints and drinks some water afterwards when kenny explodes the four boys and kyles dad laugh and applaud and stan even says that was a good one and in  kenny dies on a wheeled sled and stan says well who didnt see that coming in other s however kennys death is sometimes taken more seriously for plot purposes especially in  where it is considered a major dramatic event in the boys lives in  stan at one point reacts incredulously to the idea kenny could have ever died more than once and cartman agrees that it wouldnt make sense  filethumbrightkennys death in  kenny survives a few s in the first five seasons  kenny is asked to do many lifethreatening stage crew tasks like plugging in a cord with a puddle of water underneath the outlet he successfully performs the tasks without getting hurt or killed  which takes place entirely within stans dream kenny only dies within the dream and a false flashback that cartman has in the dream he is also  alive after his death as the school bus falls off the cliff shortly before the whole thing is revealed to be a dream  when he is struck by lightning and then revived with cpr by his new girlfriend kelly the  twoparter when he is run over by a bus in part  and presumed dead when the bus stops in mexico in part  he is scraped from underneath the bus by a mexican man and found to still be alive this being an error due to the fact his body was left behind after the bus hit him in part   in which a kid from drug rehab who had previously been posing as cartman is forced by stan and kyle to dress in kennys orange a and climb into ms crabtrees uterus as part of a television stunt his dead body is later squeezed out followed by the corpse of another kid resembling harry potter kenny was serving jailtime in new york after performing a sex act on howard stern for ten bucks during his live radio show at the time   earth day activists hack all of kennys limbs off but he is not shown to die at any point in the    the hawk takes him but he is  in scouts later   he is shown frozen in carbonite near the end of the  in the star wars movies han solo is frozen in carbonite and is then revived to normal later on since the freezing process is usually not fatal this means that if   follows the star wars canon kenny could potentially be restored although no such thing is done or talked about  in this  he was almost killed  times first by a car that two vandals turn over stan says oh my god they killed until kenny  unharmed and stan finishes with oh never mind the second time was when he was on a swing when officer barbrady stops swinging resulting in him flying and hitting himself on a brick wall there stan again says oh my god they killed and kenny gets up fine again stan says oh never mind the third time was when officer barbrady catches the socalled chickenlover who turned out to be the booktastic bus driver the chickenlover shoots his pistol and then suddenly kenny falls down stan again says oh my god they killed but kenny gets up however this time stan seems to be a bit upset that kenny did not die and says damnit but then in the end he dies because a tree falls on him  in addition to escaping death in a few s kenny does not appear in    or  and therefore does not die in any of these s however  and  are all part of the same night as  so technically he did die during those s  kenny has died only rarely during seasons seven through fourteen some deaths are not actual instances of kenny dying but are still accompanied by stan and kyles remarks such as when kennys character was killed in  the most he has died since season seven was over the superhero arc  he dies once in  and a further three times in   the   suggests that kennys deaths are caused by his a when  gives  a nearly identical a a series of unfortunate and fatal events repeatedly happen behind him meaning they all miss him  can even vaguely be heard screaming theres kenny kill him but jimmy does not even notice on the other hand in some s kenny dies without the a such as  when mr jefferson tosses him up through the ceiling thinking it was his son and killing him  kenny seems to know about the oh my god they killed kenny catchphrase said after he dies as evidenced in season one when he says a variation the catchphrase himself except with  having been shot rather than himself with kyle replying you bastards in  kenny calls cartman a bastard after stan says great job cartman you killed kyle on a third occasion kenny used the catchphrase when cartman is badly injured but stan points out that cartman is not dead  in  kenny reveals that he has a superpower  he cannot die he reveals this to  saying that he sometimes sees a bright light heaven or hell he also states that the worst part is that nobody remembers even if they see him die he considers this a curse and tries to convince the others that it is true in  nobody believes him though and when it turns out that  also had a power he silently admits defeat and shoots himself in front of everyone he is reborn instantaneously inside his mothers womb who immediately deposits the new born baby in his bed and he ages instantly into a year old before morning   kennys family is one of the poorest families in   his parents are both unstable alcoholics and occasional drug users the former which was a trait that his father stuart inherited from his own father   because kennys family is so poor they eat frozen waffles with no side dishes for dinner and bread sandwiches for breakfast in  kenny won a can of green beans for his family though they could not afford a can opener in  kennys family ate microwave pizza cartman frequently exploits kennys poverty by offering him money for performing strange or dangerous tasks in  cartman frequently mentions that his family eats poptarts for dinner this is actually proven at the end of the  kenny and his family are all  eating poptarts before a stray bullet kills kenny at the dinner table in  it is shown that all of kennys possessions are kept in a small cardboard box though his family is extremely poor his parents are known drug addicts and heavy drinkers they drink so much that only a fairly large income would pay for it which might explain the degree of poverty in  it is suggested that the mccormicks make meth for a drug cartel and in  they are arrested for having a meth lab  despite his familys poverty kenny always manages to stay current with trends in toys and video games such as maintaining  and a computer to play it on being the  or  as well being the only child in the town to have a go go action bronco a batterypowered miniature car kenny might have gotten these items from the odd jobs and dares from his friends and neighbors since his parents spend all their money on drugs and alcohol and eat whatever food is leftover his mother was also able to afford  worth of  in timmy  although it caused him and all of his friends to be extremely boring in  kenny is  recording with an iphone which seems to be his as he was taking it with him away he might have been able to afford an iphone or got it from somebody   early versions of the character first appeared in er and stones two pre  shorts   and  in the first spirit of christmas short the character resembling kenny is unnamed while the character resembling  is named kenny the unnamed kennylike character also speaks unmuffled in the first short both of these characters get killed in the short in the second spirit of christmas a character with both kennys appearance and name  and dies kennys first   appearance within the series was alongside   and  in    despite these problems kenny is often portrayed as the hero of the group indeed many of his deaths have been acts of heroic selfsacrifice among others he fixed the  backup generator by using himself to connect two wires resulting in electrocution and he once smashed a shell with his head to release  from captivity inside the shell smashing his head in too arguably the most touching of these deaths was in  when he wishes for everything to be back to normal despite that he would knowingly go to hell in the process he instead almost immediately ascended to heaven where he was gifted with a halo wings and thirty or so busty naked women apparently one saving the earth from eternal damnation causes god to overlook one not being a mormon his ascension also marked the first and to date only time his entire face has been  in other instances he has some form of cover such as a baseball cap or a snorkel mask and the first time his voice could be heard clearly  depicts kenny as a willing martyr for a cult he has recently joined in  kenny used the golden psp to defeat satans army  the most shining example of his heroism however is his role as  a hero who defends the town from evil forces including  and  first appearing in  with an unclear identity and returning in  mysterion is shown to be a resourceful and intelligent hero with a strong sense of morals and justice  however his identity remained unknown until  during which mysterion opens the  with a monologue mentioning having a power  mysterion is later revealed to have been kenny the entire time and his super ower bishis inability to die it is at this point that kenny begins taking upon the role of the hero though his loyal characteristics and sense of morality are strong his increasing frustration becomes apparent when he confronts his friends for not remembering his many deaths  he spends most of  trying to come to terms with his powers and at the end he begs cthulhu to bring back the other coon friends making the ultimate sacrifice by offering himself up noting only an immortal can kill another immortal meaning if cthulhu killed mysterion he would not be reborn  in  kenny returns as mysterion to protect his sister  he defended her against a school bully and got his foster parents arrested before they were able to hose  down with doctor pepper  when the boys decide to attack the robbers in  kenny is the one who gives instructions to kyle stan and cartman on how to ambush the intruders   it is implied in  that kenny speaks fluent romanian and a bit of spanish in    in the book   and philosophy bigger longer and

has become a scientist humanitarian philanthropist and a nobel laureate having being granted the dr title   out of all the boys kenny has the highest voice pitch aside from when acting as mysterion his speech is muffled so that it is often difficult to hear what he says although closed captions sometimes verify his lines in later s his lines have become somewhat more intelligible an example of this is in  where he  to say fuck you to cartman after he attempted to trade another chinpokomon for kennys penguin he says the same thing to kyle in  upon being told he cannot just have mints which are really antacid tablets for dinner although the interpretation of what he said was helped by the fact he was flipping kyle off at the time  his unique muffled voice is accomplished by his voice actor  speaking into his cupped hand he speaks clearly and without his hood in    and  with proper unmuffled lines in  when he is  in his baseball uniform he is heard cheering when the team wins at the beginning of the  in  when he is literally pulled out of his a in an attempt to have one of his baby teeth pulled out he lands completely nude in front of cartman and is heard groaning kenny is shown without his hood in                     and  in the film kennys voice unhooded is performed by mike judge creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill in  and  kennys unmuffled voice was performed by eric stough a former director of animation at   studios and a nowproducer of the show making it sound more highpitched than it did in the movie in the former and in the latter deeper when dressed as iron man in  kenny is voiced by matt stone who can be clearly heard but is slightly masked by a voice changer he sounds like kyle but in a higher voice in the original christmas short his mouth is visible and he has an unmuffled line yeah which sounds slightly nasally a bit like craig or clyde  despite that his mouth is rarely shown and covered by his orange a he vomits in  and his mouth is clearly  though it dis when he finishes vomiting in  when kenny as a zombie attacks a lady giving the boys candy you can see his mouth as he starts to eat her also in  when kenny is paid to eat all kinds of disgusting things for money you can clearly see his mouth as he eats a dissected manatee spleen in class and dog poo and his own vomit even though lots of kids get disgusted  he was revealed to be mysterion so in    and  you can hear his voice clearly though he disguises it with a deep tone in one scene in  kennys voice is heard unmuffled provided by eric stough as listed in the end credits and it sounds closer to  than the previous s in  when mysterion confronts cartman his voice wavers although it is debatable whether he had dropped the disguise or has simply let his guard down partially due to emotional impact is unknown kenny has the unusual ability to modify his normally highpitched voice to a very deep one as mysterion   in the earlier seasons he tended to take a backseat to the    given rather limited dialogue as opposed to them a majority of his roles involved showing off his sexual knowledge or being killed as a running gag of every  the latter resulting in stan exclaiming oh my god they killed kenny followed by kyle adding you bastards  he does however make a major plot contribution near the end of  where  is willing to grant him one wish after he made him realize that  was a bad lover kenny wishes for everything to go back to normal and sacrificially risks returning to hell in the process afterwards all the canadians are resurrected and the dark battlefield transitions into a grassy and bright atmosphere thanks to him because of his heroic sacrifice he is admitted into heaven as he initially desired and gives everyone a happy end  afterwards he was given more central s around him where he spoke more lines of dialog for example       and   kenny is also noted for having the most absences out of the boys he was also appeared in a very limited capacity in  receiving only one line total in    kenny wears an orange a orange pants and brown gloves almost all of the time kenny has his hood on so that only his eyes are  underneath his hood he has messy blond hair which looks somewhat similar to that of s another character on the show on occasion usually when he is scared or crying he will pull the strings on his hood to make it tighten although he did this once after cartman had farted in an unventilated space on an airplane  in  kenny has a a that is light purple with a part of his hair coming out of the hood black pants and brown boots with a black stripe down them later in the  he buys another a that is pink and fluffy  he is shown at times to have almost nothing on underneath his a as  in    and  though mostly he does have a white tshirt on kenny is shown to have blue eyes in  in which a mutant turkey pulls out his eye and in a closeup a blue iris is momentarily visible in  in anime style kennys eyes shows his iris which are blue however in an early draft for  kenny is described as having hazel eyes in the film and  it is shown that kenny sleeps in his underwear making him the only one of the boys who does so kyle cartman and stan all wear pajamas and  rarely sleeps and thus has no pajamas except in  however in other s he is shown sleeping in his a it would seem that his a was made from pieces of his bedroom curtains because in  when we see kenny practicing opera singing we see his curtains in the background they are of orange material and a huge part of one is missing  after  he can be  unhooded in several s although in  when stan finds kenny drowned in a pool he has a bald fade due to every kid having shaved their heads earlier in the  making him indistinguishable from the others minus cartman in  when the boys are playing with squirrels kenny is shown wearing part of his toga a bedcloth over his face mimicking how his a covers his face more parts of his faceand his hairare still visible such as in  when he is in his wrestling outfit he wears headgear that covers most of his face in the same  when playing his wrestling alterego  a parody of mexican wrestler rey mysterio he wears a mask that also covers most of his face in  he wears a baseball cap that covers up a little of his right eye and forehead as well as a jersey with the number  in  kenny is also  without his hood and unlike other times his face is clearly shown in a side view in  kenny is in his bathing suit with his face clearly shown  in the original christmas short he looks generally the same but he wears green mittens and has a red scarf his mouth is visible and his voice is intelligible it sounds a little like s or s he only has one line though  a photorealistic version of kennys appearance was produced as a police artist sketch for the   showing his nose  in the future timeline set in  he has grown a full beard and has gained much weight he wears an orange tshirt with beer bottle patterns brown shorts and green slippers with white socks he also wears a light brown hat with a yellow badge bearing the words be cool and a pair of black tinted glasses maintaining a form of cover      kenny is the most sexually knowledgeable and experienced of the group in earlier s when an unknown term is introduced to stan kyle and cartman kenny will be called upon by his friends to clarify although kenny sometimes does not know the meaning of the term himself his muffled responses are often met with laughter or further confusion kenny does seem to act differently without his a on  in  upon finding out that his girlfriend  gave another boy a bj oral sex in a tgi fridays ing lot he pursued that wish throughout the  and eventually got his wish though he subsequently died of syphilis in  he gave  a hummer also oral sex for ten bucks while promoting his   his sexual knowledge may be gleaned from his parents or from the pornography which kenny possesses in  he often performs disgusting acts for money such as dissecting a manatee and eating its spleen then regurgitating it and eating it again  he also drinks from jimbos gas tank in  in  he creates a haiku  when you rub your dick you might find a discharge that winds up on the floor  although he is something of a silent protagonist kenny still seems to be very empathetic when it comes to his friends in  he is quick to show worry about the prospect of timmy going to hell in  kennys will states that cartman will receive his  because he feels sorry for him kenny also alludes to his many deaths and his friends attitude towards them in  when he gets angry at stan for crying over kyles impending death and not recognizing kennys at all  this idea revisited in  when nobody realizes he dies a lot kenny is ultimately revealed to be a heroic character in  when he saves the world by sacrificing himself despite his perverted sense of humor cynicism and profanity he is often depicted as heroic kind and smart  kenny is also shown to be very loyal to his friends even when he is insulted or ridiculed in  kyle betrays kenny by ratting him out to the elders afterwards kenny ends up saving everyone by sacrificing himself in the early seasons cartman consistently insults kenny for being poor and constantly reminds him how much he hates him in   in which cartman is possessed by the late kenny  kenny is shown to be a fan of rob schneider when cartman refuses to watch schneider kennys soul keeps trying to get him to change the channel back  kenny normally  blankfaced as a result of his a hood but he does get visibly emotional from time to time in  kenny got mad enough at cartman who had been ruining nascars reputation to try and kill him with a sniper rifle in  he comes very close to hitting kyle when he says that not being able to die would be pretty cool kenny actually thinks it fucking hurts then again later when cartman fails to grasp the concept of being a hero in  kenny breaks down crying similarly to how  sometimes does after cartman eats all the skin out of a kfc bucket meal  afterwards he joined stan and kyle and eventually the whole of the t grade class in ignoring cartman  even though cartman tried to redeem himself their friendship never fully recovered  in  kenny has had more lines and has played a bigger role since then  and  are s that have focused on kenny in  he was also revealed to be the secret identity  a child superhero that first appeared in  this means that technically  and  have also focused on kenny  kenny is also known to have the most vile mouth in the group as he mostly swears heavily in his dialogue he also does not take any guff from cartman  while he used to be cartmans underling that role has been taken over by  kenny has many interests in  kenny has an interest in peruvian music in  he is shown to be a rather large fan of nascar racng but is offended by cartmans behavior throughout the  regarding nascar even going as far as to try and kill him he is also a fan of monster trucks as evidenced by a x poster of a monster truck hanging in his room on some occasions he is also a righty as he usually holds writing utensils in his right hand  since the   kenny has become apathetic towards his inability to die after so many deaths  both quick and painful  he views his demise as no more than an inconvenience  an excruciating and agonizing one but still extremely annoying his apathy even grew to the point where rather than walk home from cartmans house at the end of  he shoots himself in the head so that he will appear there instantly  kenny is a roman catholic and is often  in the  with the other residents of  however he is not known to be particularly religious and indeed his spontaneous combustion in the titular   caused  to believe the phenomenon was being caused by the residents debaucherous activity  during the   he converted to  along with most of the other residents of   albeit temporarily he was forced to drown himself in the  reflecting pool through  brainwashing  notably his parents would attend  meetings which is implied to have resulted in his immortality however they were not believers and only attended for the free alcohol kenny himself would fight against the cult and was unaware of it being a possible source of his curse  during  he was put into care after it was discovered that his parents were producing methamphetamine he was fostered by an  that tried to force him as well as the other children they fostered into being agnostic he was never converted and indeed as  would actively protect his sister and ultimately cause his guardians to be arrested and be placed back in the care of his parents    kenny has fought on a few occasions and is most likely the most physically active out of all the boys he holds the ability to perform his spin blossom nut squash on command as  in  he is also able to throw shurikens correctly as demonstrated by hitting butters directly in the eye with one in  he occasionally gets into physical confrontations with cartman due to cartmans abusive nature especially in early seasons while cartman overpowered him by sitting on him and farting in  kenny was able to easily beat him when he tried to stop stan and kyle from entering the wallmart with a dagger it is also shown in many other s he has a rather good accuracy with lon range objects disregarding the deleted ending to  he is easily able to hold off butters and dougie singlehandedly although in both his encounter with cartman and his encounter with professor chaos his main strategy seemed to consist of simply hitting his opponent until they gave up when the deleted ending is taken into account this is kyles fighting strategy it is also worthy to note that both cartman and butters have repeatedly been shown to be physically weak he is shown to have great climbing skilsl in that  which is again displayed in  in  kenny as  effortlessly beat up a bully who was picking on his sister  first he kicks her with enough force to send her into the air does a spinning kick into her head then punches her in the head causing her to fall on the ground   kenny is unable to die in  he remarks on how many times he has died but instead of dying permanently he ends up waking up in his bed alive he is troubled by the fact that no one remembers his deaths he views his power as a curse however cartman once stated that he dies all the time in  which indicates that cartman is the only one to remember kennys deaths but presumably due to his selfish nature refuses to acknowledge them unless it would somehow benefit him also in  stan remarks who didnt see that coming indicating that he also knows    stuart mccormick is kennys alcoholic father he is usually  hanging out with the other men in   and sometimes arguing or physically fighting with his wife stuarts alcoholism is probably why the mccormick family is so far into poverty kenny is shown to not care when stuart and kevin are fighting merely watching television with a bored look   carol mccormick is kennys young mother she is said to have had kenny when she was only  years old which would imply that she had kevin when she was  or  years old in  it is shown that after kenny dies his soul returns to her takes to another body and is reborn similarly in the last  of the mysterion trilogy kenny is literally reborn however this time it is left open that kennys immortality is due to his parents worshiping  she says in  we never should have gone to those stupid cult meetings meaning she is probably tired of having to give birth to kenny over and over again   kevin mccormick is kennys older brother he is very untidy in appearance he does not have many speaking lines but when he does speak he seems to repeat much of what he says his voice sounds similar to those of terrance mephesto bill and fosse but he must get the accent from his mom he is  with a few band aids on his face kenny is shown to not care when kevin and stuart are fighting merely watching television with a bored look kevin is quite different from kenny since kevin always gets into arguments with his family while kenny seems to ignore everything that is happening around him kenny and kevin do not seem to talk to each other much   karen mccormick is kennys reclusive younger sister she first appeared in  when she and the rest of the mccormicks visited kenny in the hospital kenny is shown to care a lot for his little sister even going so far as to dress up as his alter ego  to comfort her and show her that she is never alone as well as beating up  for attempting to bully karen in  he immediately follows karen out of the room to comfort her when their dad yells at her and uses the money he earned at  to buy her a new doll   see  for details  kennys grandfather did not have any speaking lines but he appeared in  when kenny as a stunt on the krazy kenny show gave him a fullbody massage on live television he has never been mentioned or appeared on any other  it is unknown if this was his paternal or maternal grandfather   kenny is a friendly person in general often  interacting with other boys in background scenes he is one of the leaders of the male student population along with the rest of  despite his obsession with sex he seems to have a decent relationship with girls he was shown to be successful in maintaining a serious relationship with   in  as well as    even though kenny usually rivals against craig and his friends along with stan kyle and cartman they all seem to still get along with him for the most part when the two groups are not in disagreement they can all been  playing and working together in s like  and  craig and kenny chose to be partners in  craig even allowed kenny to join him in making his animals closeup with a wideangle lens video when cartman would not let kenny join their report team in  this is explained by the fact that kenny is hooded all the time  being a news reporter he would have had to show his face and have a really nice hairstyle the given reason though is that cartman thinks kenny does not watch the news because he is poor however in s like  kenny has shown da islike for craig by saying that he does not like him though it could have merely been out of frustration that craig refused hto elp them again   in  rob schneider was possessed by kenny after eating a meat loaf that kennys soul was trapped inside then during a commercial for a rob schneider movie coming out he was  trying to kiss milly which may conclude that kenny had a crush on her also in  kenny chose milly to rub and hug him for their music video   cartman generally seems to tolerate kenny although he regards him as being lesser than him because he is poor and can even at times be  to treat kenny as sort of a general laborerservant he is also very abusive both physically and verbally cartman does appear to consider kenny as his best friend out of the other three boys although he is not above exaggerating the depth of their friendship in order to achieve or obtain something he wants usually after kenny dies or is incapacitated such as in  in the same  kenny described his general attitude toward his friendship with cartman as his feeling sorry for him because everyone else hates him however it is also shown that the two share a best friends forever necklace hence the title of the  however it is implied that cartman managed to sneak the necklace onto kennys neck in order to prove to everyone that he and kenny were indeed best friends it is  that some times when something beneficial happens to the town cartman and kenny are  hugging such as in  and  in  kenny agrees with cartmans assessment that the two are best friends as kyle and stan are however this is refuted in  in which kenny had written in his will that stan and kyle were his best friends and he never really liked eric cartman all things considered their best friendship seems to end as of   kenny will go along with cartman if he talks about something he agrees on such as the time he giggled uncontrollably when cartman farted in kyles face in  or kyle and stan if he gets really annoyed by cartmans attitude although muffled kenny has often called cartman by his first name eric such as in  when he calls cartman on the phone from mexico and later when jesus sends cartman to mexico as punishment on occasion he is known to punch cartman when cartman rips on him for being poor and cartman has been shown beating up kenny when kenny refuses to go along with his ideas particularly in the early seasons in fact in  kenny was invited to go to cartmans theme  when kyle and stan could not come  cartman has shown to get angry and defensive after kenny has died while stan and kyle take it like it was nothing and have sometimes used it to get what they want such as asking for ice cream with butterscotch in  he also seemed to be aware of kenny dying in  but in  kenny said nobody noticed  kenny has also been known to detest or mock cartman on occasion such as when cartman degraded nascar fans by crashing a stolen car into a lake in   kenny stormed down to cartmans house to yell at him nearly destroying the door in the process  he was even prepared to kill cartman in defense of nascars reputation he also laughed when kyle and stan abandoned cartman for cheating at a war game when he yelled i can play with myself all day in  in  kenny got mad at cartman again when he started claiming he hated kenny he then tried to distract cartman by pretending to be a new species of antelope so that the jakovasaurs could be smuggled to france but instead got mauled by a bear  it should be noted that although his voice is muffled kenny can be heard using cartmans first name eric on occasion such as in  making him the only one out of cartmans primary three friends to do so however in  and more recent s kenny called cartman by his surname when cartman was at his house  it should also be noted that kennys alternate identity mysterion and erics the coon appear to have a rivalry this can be  in    and  in particular mysterion kept the group name  after cartman was kicked out because it pissed cartman off beyond belief and he found it extremely funny  cartman is the only character to be aware of kennys constant dying saying he dies all the time in  in  he told a story while they were stranded on the bus about kenny dying before he was killed by a giant black monster kyle points out that kenny dying before would have been impossible because he cant die twice this would mean he is immune to the psychic effect that kennys deaths have on others by extension this may mean cartman has immunity to mind control or other psychological effects  while not shown in as much detail as kyle and cartmans newfound friendship with the boys ending their friendship with a pessimistic stan in  he also seems to be developing a better one with cartman  a picture of kenny and cartman at casa bonita is   which implies they have a close friendship  kenny does not take part in smashing cartmans electronics in    although kenny and stan do not seem to share the same bond that stan and kyle do stan does seem to think of kenny as a close friend in  out of the  boys stan has the hardest time dealing with kenny dying and cannot even bear to see him in the hospital when stan finally realizes that kenny passed on for good he feels like he was kennys worst friend until they hear about cartmans selfishness the two boys often hang out with one another when cartman and kyle get into their arguments and stan and kenny do not want to listen to it such as in  in  stan and kyle fight against cartman to not have kennys feeding tube removed to save kennys life  however in  when all hope seems lost to save kyle and stan breaks down crying in front of kenny because of kyles impending death he does not seem to care or even acknowledge the fact that kenny dies all the time this angers kenny and makes him leave stan to go home after using cartmans catchphrase screw you guys im going home  which in turn causes his death by walking under a falling piano and even then stan still fails to notice or care  during the first five seasons stan would merely say  after one of kennys classic deaths and then he would not acknowledge him again after that  like cartman and kyle kenny is at first only annoyed with stan in  with his constant complaining and buzzkilling unfortunately when stan gets worse and becomes unbearable to be with he first ditches him and then along with cartman and kyle breaks off their friendship until the conflict is resolved in   kenny and kyles relationship does not seem to be as strong as it is with the other boys kyle does not seem to really even notice kenny a lot of the time there is even a time in  when kyle says that kenny is not his friend this could be to get out of going to his house  though along with stan kyles shown his definite concern for kenny and does view him as a very close friend they rarely interact oneonone in  kenny gives all of his belongings excluding his psp to stan and kyle and stan and kyle fight very hard to save their friend from cartman and his supporters he also invites kenny to his birthday party in  kenny often sides with kyle on many issues even over cartman like in  where kenny supports kyles mascot instead of cartmans also in  kyle asked kenny to come to jew scouts so that it would be fun  despite the neglect kenny has been shown to bear feelings of friendship towards kyle even to the point of trying to convince him of his own power as mysterion to the point of shooting himself in front of him and stan much to their surprise and his later dismay when neither of them remember kenny also thinks kyle is the smartest kid in his class asking him for help in  for that reason  in the first five seasons and sporadically afterward whenever kenny dies kyle follows with you bastards after stan yells oh my god they killed kenny  after the   and after kennys comeback in the  finale   he seems to have less of a major role until season eleven sharing with butters the   where butters drew a picture of him and kenny as best friends together in an airplane in which kyle delivered to kenny at the hospital indicates that butters sees kenny as a really close friend kenny played the good cop and comforted butters in  and butters tried to help kenny during  the two were also playing together in a sandbox in  butters took kennys place when kenny died possibly hinting that butters deeply missed kenny instead of simply wanting to hang out with the other boys in  kenny and butters can be  hugging when stan and kyle break  points on guitar hero and they hifive each other after willzyx is returned to the ocean in  also in  butters seemed quite alarmed when he discovered kenny had a new whore girlfriend kenny can also be  shaking butters hand after kissing  in  in  butters considers kenny his only true friend and allows him to go to  with him against his initial protest   kenny briefly had a girlfriend named kelly in  she was first to admit her feelings for him who came to his aid during one of his famous death scenes in the next   it is revealed that he spends a lot of time at a new girlfriends house but the viewer never sees her because kenny had started dating kelly in the previous  it is safe to assume that they are one and the same kelly has not been heard of since although she was  at the dance in  possibly having arranged to meet up with kenny but not being able to as he is dead at that point if you look closely however you can actually see parts of kennys a with kelly at the dance     in  kenny gets a new girlfriend a fifth grader named tammy warner she happens to be the only person in the school poorer than kennys family classmates at school call her a slut because she gave a boy named dave darskey a bj blow job in the ing lot of a tgi fridays kenny later finds out that she did this because she got worked up watching the jonas brothers on television this prompts kenny to go and buy her tickets to a jonas brothers concert hoping that it becomes his way into her heart as well as her body after the concert tammy and several other girls are called backstage where they are given a purity ring by the jonas brothers themselves which stops them from doing anything naughty as kenny is given a purity ring by tammy he is very upset at this as well as completely bored eventually due to boredom they take off the purity rings and tammy gives kenny a bj unfortunately the next day kenny ends up contracting syphilis and thus dies in the final minutes of the  his funeral is held and the vicar attending the funeral gives a speech about the dangers of syphilis and so as we commit this young child to the earth let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease and it can be caught even if using protection   kenny is related to stans family through being named honorary nephew by  in  kenny is an immortal  while he can technically die he just keeps being reborn unless another immortal kills him aging at an increased rate  years worth of growth in a few hours and retaining memories and physical and mental characteristics   in  when kenny is tortured in hell he is in an area that  to resembles dantes sixth circle of heresy in the overall series kenny was introduced as the comic relief but was killed off in the    and stayed dead until the    kenny has had a history of ingesting things he should not  including gasoline  cat pee  alien drugs  and various other things such as a manatee spleen dog poop and his own vomit  as  in  kenny seems to buy shaving cream and razors on a regular basis noting that it was for his balls this indicates he is either producing pubic hair extremely early on or just does not quite get the idea of a razor since  kenny has been the only   character to have their hair change in appearance although it is always blond and messy regularly he has had at least four hair styles the original in the movie the new style in  a slightly shorter one used in  mostly hidden under a baseball cap and an updated version of the original style since  kenny seems to prefer lying down to sitting up  whenever he is doing something on the floor with the other boys board games toys and so forth he will be lying on his front while the others generally sit down kenny owns a laptop courtesy of one laptop per child  kenny has a pet cat who was shown in major boobage it was only mentioned briefly in  by cartman who thought that he had broken the cats leg the week before was the reason that kenny voted for the giant douche despite this a black cat can be  walking near kennys house in  whether this is kennys cat or not is unknown kenny has gotten the least amount of people killed  only himself and  stan and cartman chainsawed dozens of people while they were zombies kyle inadvertently caused dozens of pedophiles to kill themselves to stop cartman from faking tourettes syndrome and butters has accidentally killed many people while tapdancing bebe killed kenny twice in  and  cartman killed kenny five times he killed him directly in  and  and killed him indirectly in   and  kyle killed kenny three times in    along with stan and  along with stan stan also killed kenny three times in   and he indirectly causes his death in  since it was his idea to go zip lining in the first place kennys perverted sense of humor is not limited to obvious innuendo  he once did a glitterandglue drawing of a clown holding someones head in one hand and a bloody knife in the other this could also mean he is coulrophobic  kenny is the only one of the four main boys who is not imaginary in that the others had to be reimagined by butters  however since cartman was able to imagine something into imaginationland something only real people can do the others can be considered real kenny has been turned into a platypus  a ghost who then possessed rob schneider a pot roast which rob schneider ate to be possessed and cartman  and has been resurrected as a zombie  kenny has a habit of hurting himself when he gets bored  during a tedious add test he ended up bashing his head against a wall repeatedly  and during a presentation by the butt out group he began chewing his own hand  while in his a kenny never says yes or no if he agrees with something he always says yeah or uhhuh furthermore in  he answered nope when cartman asked him something other times he says nuhuh instead kenny is the only boy known to sleep in his underwear however sometimes  in particular shortly after a resurrection  he wears his a to bed kenny is able to make moose calls as shown in  kenny has killed himself a total of ten times some of them being heroic selfsacrifices but others not so in  he uses his body to complete an electrical circuit which brings the hospitals generator online thus saving the lives of every patient on life support in  kenny uses his head to break open a shell that contains  the trauma kills him but moses successfully defeats haman afterward in  he shoots himself in the head to try to prove a point to the other boys he later jumps onto a spike to improvise a way out of rlyeh then later shoots himself again in order to return home in  kenny dies while laughing uncontrollably at a humiliating video of cartman in  kenny drowns himself in the reflecting pool after being brainwashed by  in  while  attacks the town kenny initiates a game of swingball which results in the ball tying him to the pole by the neck and asphyxiates him in  kenny chokes himself to death while trying to achieve a superawesome orgasm in  a baby kenny holds on to a lit firework for too long and he is blown up in  he gets hungry while on the debate team so he eats a bowl of mints that was sitting on the table he then gets a cup of water to wash them down but  arrives to tell him that the mints were actually antacid tablets as soon as kenny drinks the water his body inflates and then explodes all over the place as of  kenny has had the most absences out of the four main boys his girlfriend broke up with him at the end of  as he can be  crying on the floor at the end of the  it is unknown who he was in a relationship with as the breakup happened offscreen kenny is the only one of  who has not had an  involving his birthday cartman had  kyle had  and stan had                                                   kenny  as one of the main characters along with   and  kenny is one of the playable characters   kenny  as  the same role he filled in the  arc this time remaining on cartmans side for most of the game however he betrays both cartman and kyle since he was born a halforc a species that was destroyed by humans and elves the player must then defeat him as a regular character and a nazi zombie before they must use the power of farting to fully defeat him and the nazi zombies
