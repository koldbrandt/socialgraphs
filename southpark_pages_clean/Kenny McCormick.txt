is shown to be one of the more intelligent characters later on in the series along with Kyle Stan Jimmy and Token Kenny also seems to be good at Origami when you usually see him in his desk messing around with paper  Weaponry Kenny is shown to be the best with weaponry in the group Although Cartman uses them more he is unskilled with them In  he blows up the fish with a grenade in the lake and shoots a ram down with a shotgun He also shows skill with a shuriken and hits right on target in  Kenny is shown in  to be able to do a backflip when they sneak into the military base while climbing

race car As Mysterion Kenny takes the gun from Captain Hindsight and uses it effectively against himself twice loading it in the process showing knowledge of that weapon In  Kenny is able to perfectly

Heavens equivalent of Keanu Reeves Neo from the Matrix trilogy or John Constantine from the film Constantine In  he is a human hunter in the game World of Warcraft a raceclass combination not actually possible in the game until the release of the Cataclysm expansion four years after the episode In  he plays the  Okama Gamesphere with the other boys until his death at which time Towelie takes his place In the  episode he suffers a nonfatal seizure while playing a game about bombing Pearl Harbor Also in  he plays the drums in Rock Band playing the song Poker Face by Lady Gaga with Kyle on the guitar and Cartman on the vocals Also in  he is playing EA Sports  on the Xbox  with Cartman and appears to be winning  Music Kenny appears to be very musically talented After taking opera voice lessons in  Kenny is shown to be very good at singing He uses this talent to travel to Romania where he performs for money He is also a good drummer as seen in  and  also playing drums on Rock Band in  and plays violin as seen in  He can also sing and dance at the same time extremely evident in   and  Also in  it is shown that he can play the flute as well He along with the rest of the fourth grade third grade at the time is shown to have questionable talent with the recorder as seen in  In a pan flute band he can play the Zampona and he is seen with a trumpet at the end when they think of starting a salsa band  Sports He played football in the Season One episode  was part of the dodgeball team in the Season Two episode  and played Center Field on the baseball team in the Season Nine episode  In  and  the number on the back of his shirt is the number  a joke on how Kenny is unlucky due to being in poverty and dying all the time In  his number is  a reference to his perverted sense of humor Kenny can also play tetherball but ended up getting strangled by it in  In  Kenny is shown to love NASCAR In  he was seen playing street hockey with the rest of the boys He has also played basketball with Cartman Stan and Kyle   In the future timeline set in  Kenny has become a scientist humanitarian philanthropist and a Nobel laureate having being granted the Dr title   Out of all the boys Kenny has the highest voice pitch aside from when acting as Mysterion His speech is muffled so that it is often difficult to hear what he says although closed captions sometimes verify his lines In later episodes his lines have become somewhat more intelligible An example of this is in  where he appears to say Fuck you to Cartman after he attempted to trade another Chinpokomon for Kennys Penguin He says the same thing to Kyle in  upon being told he cannot just have mints which are really antacid tablets for dinner although the interpretation of what he said was helped by the fact he was flipping Kyle off at the time  His unique muffled voice is accomplished by his voice actor  speaking into his cupped hand He speaks clearly and without his hood in    and  with proper unmuffled lines In  when he is seen in his baseball uniform he is heard cheering when the team wins at the beginning of the episode In  when he is literally pulled out of his parka in an attempt to have one of his baby teeth pulled out he lands completely nude in front of Cartman and is heard groaning Kenny is shown without his hood in                     and  In the film Kennys voice unhooded is performed by Mike Judge creator of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill In  and  Kennys unmuffled voice was performed by Eric Stough a former Director of Animation at South Park Studios and a nowproducer of the show making it sound more highpitched than it did in the movie in the former and in the latter deeper When dressed as Iron Man in  Kenny is voiced by Matt Stone who can be clearly heard but is slightly masked by a voice changer He sounds like Kyle but in a higher voice In the original Christmas short his mouth is visible and he has an unmuffled line Yeah which sounds slightly nasally a bit like Craig or Clyde  Despite that his mouth is rarely shown and covered by his orange parka he vomits in  and his mouth is clearly seen though it disappears when he finishes vomiting In  when Kenny as a zombie attacks a lady giving the boys candy you can see his mouth as he starts to eat her Also in  when Kenny is paid to eat all kinds of disgusting things for money you can clearly see his mouth as he eats a dissected Manatee spleen in class and dog poo and his own vomit even though lots of kids get disgusted  He was revealed to be Mysterion so in    and  you can hear his voice clearly though he disguises it with a deep tone In one scene in  Kennys voice is heard unmuffled provided by Eric Stough as listed in the end credits and it sounds closer to  than the previous episodes In  when Mysterion confronts Cartman his voice wavers although it is debatable whether he had dropped the disguise or has simply let his guard down partially due to emotional impact is unknown Kenny has the unusual ability to modify his normally highpitched voice to a very deep one as Mysterion   In the earlier seasons he tended to take a backseat to the    given rather limited dialogue as opposed to them A majority of his roles involved showing off his sexual knowledge or being killed as a running gag of every episode the latter resulting in Stan exclaiming Oh my God they killed Kenny followed by Kyle adding You bastards  He does however make a major plot contribution near the end of  where  is willing to grant him one wish after he made him realize that  was a bad lover Kenny wishes for everything to go back to normal and sacrificially risks returning to Hell in the process Afterwards all the Canadians are resurrected and the dark battlefield transitions into a grassy and bright atmosphere thanks to him Because of his heroic sacrifice he is admitted into Heaven as he initially desired and gives everyone a happy end  Afterwards he was given more central episodes around him where he spoke more lines of dialog for example       and   Kenny is also noted for having the most absences out of the boys He was also appeared in a very limited capacity in  receiving only one line total in    Kenny wears an orange parka orange pants and brown gloves Almost all of the time Kenny has his hood on so that only his eyes are seen Underneath his hood he has messy blond hair which looks somewhat similar to that of s another character on the show On occasion usually when he is scared or crying he will pull the strings on his hood to make it tighten although he did this once after Cartman had farted in an unventilated space on an airplane  In  Kenny has a parka that is light purple with a part of his hair coming out of the hood black pants and brown boots with a black stripe down them Later in the episode he buys another parka that is pink and fluffy  He is shown at times to have almost nothing on underneath his parka as seen in    and  though mostly he does have a white Tshirt on Kenny is shown to have blue eyes in  in which a mutant turkey pulls out his eye and in a closeup a blue iris is momentarily visible In  in anime style Kennys eyes shows his iris which are blue However in an early draft for  Kenny is described as having hazel eyes In the film and  it is shown that Kenny sleeps in his underwear making him the only one of the boys who does so Kyle Cartman and Stan all wear pajamas and  rarely sleeps and thus has no pajamas except in  However in other episodes he is shown sleeping in his parka It would seem that his parka was made from pieces of his bedroom curtains because in  when we see Kenny practicing opera singing we see his curtains in the background They are of orange material and a huge part of one is missing  After  he can be seen unhooded in several episodes although in  when Stan finds Kenny drowned in a pool he has a bald fade due to every kid having shaved their heads earlier in the episode making him indistinguishable from the others minus Cartman In  when the boys are playing with squirrels Kenny is shown wearing part of his toga a bedcloth over his face mimicking how his parka covers his face More parts of his faceand his hairare still visible such as in  when he is in his wrestling outfit he wears headgear that covers most of his face in the same episode when playing his wrestling alterego  a parody of Mexican wrestler Rey Mysterio he wears a mask that also covers most of his face In  he wears a baseball cap that covers up a little of his right eye and forehead as well as a jersey with the number  In  Kenny is also seen without his hood and unlike other times his face is clearly shown in a side view In  Kenny is in his bathing suit with his face clearly shown  In the original Christmas short he looks generally the same but he wears green mittens and has a red scarf His mouth is visible and his voice is intelligible it sounds a little like s or s He only has one line though  A photorealistic version of Kennys appearance was produced as a police artist sketch for the episode  showing his nose  In the future timeline set in  he has grown a full beard and has gained much weight He wears an orange tshirt with beer bottle patterns brown shorts and green slippers with white socks He also wears a light brown hat with a yellow badge bearing the words Be Cool and a pair of black tinted glasses maintaining a form of cover      Kenny is the most sexually knowledgeable and experienced of the group In earlier episodes when an unknown term is introduced to Stan Kyle and Cartman Kenny will be called upon by his friends to clarify although Kenny sometimes does not know the meaning of the term himself His muffled responses are often met with laughter or further confusion Kenny does seem to act differently without his parka on  In  upon finding out that his girlfriend  gave another boy a BJ oral sex in a TGI Fridays parking lot he pursued that wish throughout the episode and eventually got his wish though he subsequently died of syphilis In  he gave  a hummer also oral sex for ten bucks while promoting his   His sexual knowledge may be gleaned from his parents or from the pornography which Kenny possesses in  He often performs disgusting acts for money such as dissecting a Manatee and eating its spleen then regurgitating it and eating it again  He also drinks from Jimbos gas tank in  In  he creates a haiku  When you rub your dick You might find a discharge that Winds up on the floor  Although he is something of a silent protagonist Kenny still seems to be very empathetic when it comes to his friends In  he is quick to show worry about the prospect of Timmy going to hell In  Kennys will states that Cartman will receive his  because he feels sorry for him Kenny also alludes to his many deaths and his friends attitude towards them in  when he gets angry at Stan for crying over Kyles impending death and not recognizing Kennys at all  this idea revisited in  when nobody realizes he dies a lot Kenny is ultimately revealed to be a heroic character in  when he saves the world by sacrificing himself Despite his perverted sense of humor cynicism and profanity he is often depicted as heroic kind and smart  Kenny is also shown to be very loyal to his friends even when he is insulted or ridiculed In  Kyle betrays Kenny by ratting him out to the elders Afterwards Kenny ends up saving everyone by sacrificing himself In the early seasons Cartman consistently insults Kenny for being poor and constantly reminds him how much he hates him In   in which Cartman is possessed by the late Kenny  Kenny is shown to be a fan of Rob Schneider When Cartman refuses to watch Schneider Kennys soul keeps trying to get him to change the channel back  Kenny normally appears blankfaced as a result of his parka hood but he does get visibly emotional from time to time In  Kenny got mad enough at Cartman who had been ruining NASCARs reputation to try and kill him with a sniper rifle In  he comes very close to hitting Kyle when he says that not being able to die would be pretty cool Kenny actually thinks it fucking hurts then again later when Cartman fails to grasp the concept of being a hero In  Kenny breaks down crying similarly to how  sometimes does after Cartman eats all the skin out of a KFC bucket meal  afterwards he joined Stan and Kyle and eventually the whole of the t grade class in ignoring Cartman  even though Cartman tried to redeem himself their friendship never fully recovered  In  Kenny has had more lines and has played a bigger role since then  and  are episodes that have focused on Kenny In  he was also revealed to be the secret identity  a child superhero that first appeared in  this means that technically  and  have also focused on Kenny  Kenny is also known to have the most vile mouth in the group as he mostly swears heavily in his dialogue He also does not take any guff from Cartman  while he used to be Cartmans underling that role has been taken over by  Kenny has many interests in  Kenny has an interest in Peruvian music in  he is shown to be a rather large fan of NASCAR racng but is offended by Cartmans behavior throughout the episode regarding NASCAR even going as far as to try and kill him He is also a fan of monster trucks as evidenced by a x poster of a monster truck hanging in his room on some occasions He is also a righty as he usually holds writing utensils in his right hand  Since the episode  Kenny has become apathetic towards his inability to die After so many deaths  both quick and painful  he views his demise as no more than an inconvenience  an excruciating and agonizing one but still extremely annoying His apathy even grew to the point where rather than walk home from Cartmans house at the end of  he shoots himself in the head so that he will appear there instantly  Kenny is a Roman Catholic and is often seen in the  with the other residents of  However he is not known to be particularly religious and indeed his spontaneous combustion in the titular episode  caused  to believe the phenomenon was being caused by the residents debaucherous activity  During the episode  he converted to  along with most of the other residents of South Park albeit temporarily He was forced to drown himself in the  Reflecting Pool through  brainwashing  Notably his parents would attend  meetings which is implied to have resulted in his immortality However they were not believers and only attended for the free alcohol Kenny himself would fight against the cult and was unaware of it being a possible source of his curse  During  he was put into care after it was discovered that his parents were producing methamphetamine He was fostered by an  that tried to force him as well as the other children they fostered into being Agnostic He was never converted and indeed as  would actively protect his sister and ultimately cause his guardians to be arrested and be placed back in the care of his parents    Kenny has fought on a few occasions and is most likely the most physically active out of all the boys He holds the ability to perform his Spin Blossom Nut Squash on command as seen in  He is also able to throw shurikens correctly as demonstrated by hitting Butters directly in the eye with one in  He occasionally gets into physical confrontations with Cartman due to Cartmans abusive nature especially in early seasons While Cartman overpowered him by sitting on him and farting in  Kenny was able to easily beat him when he tried to stop Stan and Kyle from entering the WallMart with a dagger It is also shown in many other episodes he has a rather good accuracy with lon range objects Disregarding the deleted ending to  he is easily able to hold off Butters and Dougie singlehandedly although in both his encounter with Cartman and his encounter with Professor Chaos his main strategy seemed to consist of simply hitting his opponent until they gave up When the deleted ending is taken into account this is Kyles fighting strategy It is also worthy to note that both Cartman and Butters have repeatedly been shown to be physically weak He is shown to have great climbing skilsl in that episode which is again displayed in  In  Kenny as  effortlessly beat up a bully who was picking on his sister  first he kicks her with enough force to send her into the air does a spinning kick into her head then punches her in the head causing her to fall on the ground   Kenny is unable to die In  he remarks on how many times he has died but instead of dying permanently he ends up waking up in his bed alive He is troubled by the fact that no one remembers his deaths He views his power as a curse However Cartman once stated that he dies all the time in  which indicates that Cartman is the only one to remember Kennys deaths but presumably due to his selfish nature refuses to acknowledge them unless it would somehow benefit him Also in  Stan remarks Who didnt see that coming indicating that he also knows    Stuart McCormick is Kennys alcoholic father He is usually seen hanging out with the other men in South Park and sometimes arguing or physically fighting with his wife Stuarts alcoholism is probably why the McCormick family is so far into poverty Kenny is shown to not care when Stuart and Kevin are fighting merely watching television with a bored look   Carol McCormick is Kennys young mother She is said to have had Kenny when she was only  years old which would imply that she had Kevin when she was  or  years old In  it is shown that after Kenny dies his soul returns to her takes to another body and is reborn Similarly in the last episode of the Mysterion Trilogy Kenny is literally reborn however this time it is left open that Kennys immortality is due to his parents worshiping  She says in  We never should have gone to those stupid cult meetings meaning she is probably tired of having to give birth to Kenny over and over again   Kevin McCormick is Kennys older brother He is very untidy in appearance He does not have many speaking lines but when he does speak he seems to repeat much of what he says His voice sounds similar to those of Terrance Mephesto Bill and Fosse but he must get the accent from his mom He is seen with a few band aids on his face Kenny is shown to not care when Kevin and Stuart are fighting merely watching television with a bored look Kevin is quite different from Kenny since Kevin always gets into arguments with his family while Kenny seems to ignore everything that is happening around him Kenny and Kevin do not seem to talk to each other much   Karen McCormick is Kennys reclusive younger sister She first appeared in  when she and the rest of the McCormicks visited Kenny in the hospital Kenny is shown to care a lot for his little sister even going so far as to dress up as his alter ego  to comfort her and show her that she is never alone as well as beating up  for attempting to bully Karen In  he immediately follows Karen out of the room to comfort her when their dad yells at her and uses the money he earned at  to buy her a new doll   See  for details  Kennys grandfather did not have any speaking lines but he appeared in  when Kenny as a stunt on the Krazy Kenny Show gave him a fullbody massage on live television He has never been mentioned or appeared on any other episode It is unknown if this was his paternal or maternal grandfather   Kenny is a friendly person in general often seen interacting with other boys in background scenes He is one of the leaders of the male student population along with the rest of  Despite his obsession with sex he seems to have a decent relationship with girls He was shown to be successful in maintaining a serious relationship with   in  as well as    Even though Kenny usually rivals against Craig and his friends along with Stan Kyle and Cartman they all seem to still get along with him for the most part when the two groups are not in disagreement They can all been seen playing and working together in episodes like  and  Craig and Kenny chose to be partners in  Craig even allowed Kenny to join him in making his Animals CloseUp With a WideAngle Lens video when Cartman would not let Kenny join their report team in  This is explained by the fact that Kenny is hooded all the time  being a news reporter he would have had to show his face and have a really nice hairstyle The given reason though is that Cartman thinks Kenny does not watch the news because he is poor However in episodes like  Kenny has shown da islike for Craig by saying that he does not like him though it could have merely been out of frustration that Craig refused hto elp them again   In  Rob Schneider was possessed by Kenny after eating a meat loaf that Kennys soul was trapped inside Then during a commercial for a Rob Schneider movie coming out he was seen trying to kiss Milly which may conclude that Kenny had a crush on her Also in  Kenny chose Milly to rub and hug him for their music video   Cartman generally seems to tolerate Kenny although he regards him as being lesser than him because he is poor and can even at times be seen to treat Kenny as sort of a general laborerservant he is also very abusive both physically and verbally Cartman does appear to consider Kenny as his best friend out of the other three boys although he is not above exaggerating the depth of their friendship in order to achieve or obtain something he wants usually after Kenny dies or is incapacitated such as in  In the same episode Kenny described his general attitude toward his friendship with Cartman as his feeling sorry for him because everyone else hates him However it is also shown that the two share a best friends forever necklace hence the title of the episode However it is implied that Cartman managed to sneak the necklace onto Kennys neck in order to prove to everyone that he and Kenny were indeed best friends It is seen that some times when something beneficial happens to the town Cartman and Kenny are seen hugging such as in  and  In  Kenny agrees with Cartmans assessment that the two are best friends as Kyle and Stan are However this is refuted in  in which Kenny had written in his will that Stan and Kyle were his best friends and he never really liked Eric Cartman All things considered their best friendship seems to end as of   Kenny will go along with Cartman if he talks about something he agrees on such as the time he giggled uncontrollably when Cartman farted in Kyles face in  or Kyle and Stan if he gets really annoyed by Cartmans attitude Although muffled Kenny has often called Cartman by his first name Eric such as in  when he calls Cartman on the phone from Mexico and later when Jesus sends Cartman to Mexico as punishment On occasion he is known to punch Cartman when Cartman rips on him for being poor and Cartman has been shown beating up Kenny when Kenny refuses to go along with his ideas particularly in the early seasons In fact in  Kenny was invited to go to Cartmans theme park when Kyle and Stan could not come  Cartman has shown to get angry and defensive after Kenny has died while Stan and Kyle take it like it was nothing and have sometimes used it to get what they want such as asking for ice cream with butterscotch in  He also seemed to be aware of Kenny dying in  but in  Kenny said nobody noticed  Kenny has also been known to detest or mock Cartman on occasion such as when Cartman degraded NASCAR fans by crashing a stolen car into a lake in   Kenny stormed down to Cartmans house to yell at him nearly destroying the door in the process  he was even prepared to kill Cartman in defense of NASCARs reputation He also laughed when Kyle and Stan abandoned Cartman for cheating at a war game when he yelled I can play with myself all day in  In  Kenny got mad at Cartman again when he started claiming he hated Kenny He then tried to distract Cartman by pretending to be a new species of antelope so that the Jakovasaurs could be smuggled to France but instead got mauled by a bear  It should be noted that although his voice is muffled Kenny can be heard using Cartmans first name Eric on occasion such as in  making him the only one out of Cartmans primary three friends to do so However in  and more recent episodes Kenny called Cartman by his surname when Cartman was at his house  It should also be noted that Kennys alternate identity Mysterion and Erics the Coon appear to have a rivalry This can be seen in    and  In particular Mysterion kept the group name  after Cartman was kicked out because it pissed Cartman off beyond belief and he found it extremely funny  Cartman is the only character to be aware of Kennys constant dying saying He dies all the time in  In  he told a story while they were stranded on the bus about Kenny dying before he was killed by a giant black monster Kyle points out that Kenny dying before would have been impossible because he cant die twice This would mean he is immune to the psychic effect that Kennys deaths have on others By extension this may mean Cartman has immunity to mind control or other psychological effects  While not shown in as much detail as Kyle and Cartmans newfound friendship with the boys ending their friendship with a pessimistic Stan in  he also seems to be developing a better one with Cartman  A picture of Kenny and Cartman at Casa Bonita is seen  which implies they have a close friendship  Kenny does not take part in smashing Cartmans electronics in    Although Kenny and Stan do not seem to share the same bond that Stan and Kyle do Stan does seem to think of Kenny as a close friend In  out of the  boys Stan has the hardest time dealing with Kenny dying and cannot even bear to see him in the hospital When Stan finally realizes that Kenny passed on for good he feels like he was Kennys worst friend until they hear about Cartmans selfishness The two boys often hang out with one another when Cartman and Kyle get into their arguments and Stan and Kenny do not want to listen to it such as in  In  Stan and Kyle fight against Cartman to not have Kennys feeding tube removed to save Kennys life  However in  when all hope seems lost to save Kyle and Stan breaks down crying in front of Kenny because of Kyles impending death he does not seem to care or even acknowledge the fact that Kenny dies all the time This angers Kenny and makes him leave Stan to go home after using Cartmans catchphrase Screw you guys Im going home  which in turn causes his death by walking under a falling piano and even then Stan still fails to notice or care  During the first five seasons Stan would merely say  after one of Kennys classic deaths and then he would not acknowledge him again after that  Like Cartman and Kyle Kenny is at first only annoyed with Stan in  with his constant complaining and buzzkilling Unfortunately when Stan gets worse and becomes unbearable to be with he first ditches him and then along with Cartman and Kyle breaks off their friendship until the conflict is resolved in   Kenny and Kyles relationship does not seem to be as strong as it is with the other boys Kyle does not seem to really even notice Kenny a lot of the time There is even a time in  when Kyle says that Kenny is not his friend this could be to get out of going to his house  Though along with Stan Kyles shown his definite concern for Kenny and does view him as a very close friend they rarely interact oneonone In  Kenny gives all of his belongings excluding his PSP to Stan and Kyle and Stan and Kyle fight very hard to save their friend from Cartman and his supporters He also invites Kenny to his birthday party in  Kenny often sides with Kyle on many issues even over Cartman like in  where Kenny supports Kyles mascot instead of Cartmans Also in  Kyle asked Kenny to come to Jew Scouts so that it would be fun  Despite the neglect Kenny has been shown to bear feelings of friendship towards Kyle even to the point of trying to convince him of his own power as Mysterion to the point of shooting himself in front of him and Stan much to their surprise and his later dismay when neither of them remember Kenny also thinks Kyle is the smartest kid in his class asking him for help in  for that reason  In the first five seasons and sporadically afterward whenever Kenny dies Kyle follows with You bastards after Stan yells Oh my God they killed Kenny  After the episode  and after Kennys comeback in the  finale   he seems to have less of a major role until Season Eleven sharing with Butters The episode  where Butters drew a picture of him and Kenny as best friends together in an airplane in which Kyle delivered to Kenny at the hospital indicates that Butters sees Kenny as a really close friend Kenny played the good cop and comforted Butters in  and Butters tried to help Kenny during  The two were also playing together in a sandbox in  Butters took Kennys place when Kenny died possibly hinting that Butters deeply missed Kenny instead of simply wanting to hang out with the other boys In  Kenny and Butters can be seen hugging when Stan and Kyle break  points on Guitar Hero and they hifive each other after Willzyx is returned to the ocean in  Also in  Butters seemed quite alarmed when he discovered Kenny had a new whore girlfriend Kenny can also be seen shaking Butters hand after kissing  in  In  Butters considers Kenny his only true friend and allows him to go to  with him against his initial protest   Kenny briefly had a girlfriend named Kelly in  she was first to admit her feelings for him who came to his aid during one of his famous death scenes In the next episode  it is revealed that he spends a lot of time at a new girlfriends house but the viewer never sees her Because Kenny had started dating Kelly in the previous episode it is safe to assume that they are one and the same Kelly has not been heard of since although she was seen at the dance in  possibly having arranged to meet up with Kenny but not being able to as he is dead at that point If you look closely however you can actually see parts of Kennys parka with Kelly at the dance     In  Kenny gets a new girlfriend a fifth grader named Tammy Warner She happens to be the only person in the school poorer than Kennys family Classmates at
