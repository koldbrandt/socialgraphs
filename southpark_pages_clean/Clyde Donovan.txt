he guesses twelve  Garrison then referred to him as a complete retard Or when he writes a poor essay in another essay on why people need to recycle However considering that Mr Garrison never actually teaches the kids its probably not Clydes fault  He has a habit of sobbing uncontrollably whenever he witnesses something upsetting Examples of this are when he hears Cartman singing in  when the adults decide to give all of the money they would have spent on Christmas presents for their kids to the CategoryBroflovski  Schwartz familyBroflovskis in  and when he realizes that there were no crystal clear lagoons treasure and plunder after he joined Cartmans Somalian pirate club in  This usually gets an angry response from Cartman  On several occasions when things get surreal in the show Clyde shows little or no interest For instance when the boys audition for a new fourth friend and he is eliminated as a candidate he eventually decides that it is stupid and shows no actual interest in being their fourth friend Also while everyone else is obsessing over the  game he questions its importance and reads Playboy instead which causes the  to defeat the other players once again During

since Clyde believed himself to be the only one who had lice He also notified Ms Garrison to stop the sock bathing and tried to delay the other boys until it arrived when it is revealed that all the

for adultrelated materials In the episode  he is seen reading a Playboy magazine instead of playing the game and in  the topic of his presentation is mentioned as lesbian cheerleaders In the episode

up for Cartman when Kyle and Stan were ridiculing him for his discovery of the girls future telling device This surprised many of the boys who were in Cartmans basement at the time including Cartman himself Although this initially indicates that he is somewhat on Cartmans side he ignores him along with the rest of the class in  He may have only been curious about the future telling device Cartman was reporting and wanted Stan and Kyle to be quiet while Cartman explained He might also still feel loyalty towards Cartman for returning to South Park in  evidenced by his willingness to accept Cartman as a leader such as when he joined his crew in  He also seems to be much more willing than the other kids to accept Cartmans bigoted views possibly because he agrees with Cartman on occasion saying  creeped him out in      He told the environmentalists in  that his father like  is a geologist though  is only shown with Clyde alongside his mother The couple appears again in the Atheists Club in  leading us to believe that Clydes family like most of South Parks residents is Roman Catholic He has a dog named  who had a sexual encounter with Stans dog  His mother is referred to as  in  His name suggests Irish or Scottish ancestry however his mother is Dutch as revealed in   In the  finale  it is revealed that his father owns a shoe shop The girls declared him the cutest boy in South Park Elementary so that they could have easier shoeshopping sprees However as mentioned above Mr Donovan was supposedly a geologist Of course he may have more than one job or he may have quit geology
