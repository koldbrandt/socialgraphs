confirmed  in  clyde is announced as having a colostomy by  and as such was incapable of and therefore innocent of defecating into a urinal however this was retconned in  and   in the future timeline set in  clyde wears a beige hawaiian tshirt dark gray shorts and blue sneakers he also carries a golden watch on his left wrist     clyde is not very clever or at least not good at mathematics and is often portrayed as one of the less intelligent members of the class when his  asks him what two times five equals he guesses twelve  garrison then referred to him as a complete retard or when he writes a poor essay in another essay on why people need to recycle however considering that mr garrison never actually teaches the kids its probably not clydes fault  he has a habit of sobbing uncontrollably whenever he witnesses something upsetting examples of this are when he hears cartman singing in  when the adults decide to give all of the money they would have spent on christmas presents for their kids to the categorybroflovski  schwartz familybroflovskis in  and when he realizes that there were no crystal clear lagoons treasure and plunder after he joined cartmans somalian pirate club in  this usually gets an angry response from cartman  on several occasions when things get surreal in the show clyde shows little or no interest for instance when the boys audition for a new fourth friend and he is eliminated as a candidate he eventually decides that it is stupid and shows no actual interest in being their fourth friend also while everyone else is obsessing over the  game he questions its importance and reads playboy instead which causes the  to defeat the other players once again during  he does his homework instead of listening to the murder of  on the intercom  clyde seems to know a lot about movies he has lord of the rings on dvd in  other examples are in  and   clyde  to be one of the nicer boys or at least he has a better sense of morality at times in

goddammit while filling in for cartman as the fat kid in  he refused to sock bathe  when kenny is accused of having head lice since clyde believed himself to be the only one who had lice he also notified ms garrison to stop the sock bathing and tried to delay the other boys until it arrived when it is revealed that all the kids had head lice this means clyde is the only boy who felt guilty for dumping the target for having head lice onto kenny whereas all the other boys never contacted mr garrison or showed even a bit of remorse clyde can as well be  defending cartman in  in  clyde even tried to take the fall for the person who took a crap in the urinal in  clyde mentions that he takes the time to read the terms and conditions on the apple store so that he knows what he is agreeing to filethumbleftclyde admiring himself in  in  when clyde is listed on the corrupted list as best looking he becomes arrogant and narcissistic but he is still somewhat caring towards the others as he attempts to make  feel better for being listed last though does it in a careless way  clyde seems to have a liking for adultrelated materials in the   he is  reading a playboy magazine instead of playing the game and in  the topic of his presentation is mentioned as lesbian cheerleaders in the    says that one of her hobbies is getting my snootch pounded on friday nights to which clyde responds nice although he could also have been happy with how well the idea had turned out  judging by his tone this was not the case  in  clyde was extremely ashamed of having head lice even going so far as to tell a little girl at the doctors clinic that he had  to avoid being found out  in  clyde stood up for cartman when kyle and stan were ridiculing him for his discovery of the girls future telling device this surprised many of the boys who were in cartmans basement at the time including cartman himself although this initially indicates that he is somewhat on cartmans side he ignores him along with the rest of the class in  he may have only been curious about the future telling device cartman was reporting and wanted stan and kyle to be quiet while cartman explained he might also still feel loyalty towards cartman for returning to   in  evidenced by his willingness to accept cartman as a leader such as when he joined his crew in  he also seems to be much more willing than the other kids to accept cartmans bigoted views possibly because he agrees with cartman on occasion saying  creeped him out in      he told the environmentalists in  that his father like  is a geologist though  is only shown with clyde alongside his mother the couple  again in the atheists club in  leading us to believe that clydes family like most of  s residents is roman catholic he has a dog named

that his father owns a shoe shop the girls declared him the cutest boy in   elementary so that they could have easier shoeshopping sprees however as mentioned above mr donovan was supposedly a geologist of course he may have more than one job or he may have quit geology since  and taken up a career as a shoe store owner another version of this goof is that he is not clydes real father at all  the donovan family apparently sold their house and moved to another as of the season eight   as it is mentioned that  bought the donovans old house  in the   shortly before her death clydes mother mentions that he has a sister asking him to put the toilet seat down from now on for his sisters sake   clydes last name appeared on merchandise during the first few seasons as clyde goodman but this name was never used on the show during  he was referred to as clyde donovan during a news segment yet a few seasons later during  the nurse asks him clyde harris is it and while it may have been a mistake on her part later airings corrected the line to donovan in  on facebook his name is changed back to clyde donovan     clyde seems to get along with craig quite well he even seems to

names are sometimes mixed up as shown in  and they have nearly identical nasally voices this was also noted in  when after you talk to craig after he replaces clyde as the owner of the armory he will say he was given that role because the grand wizard cartman said he sounds like clyde he denies that however  in  craig joins clydes army of darkness as his secondincommand   token and clyde appear to be good friends they are usually  talking to each other in background scenes and both form the core of craigs group    clyde and kyle get along well normally in  when clyde had been voted the cutest boy in class and kyle had been voted the ugliest clyde still tried to comfort kyle  even though he was being a bit condescending at the time however kyle did hurl abuse at clyde during their sledding

birthday in the same  kyle was sitting right next to him    clyde usually shows little or no interest in the antics of cartman however he does join in from time to time usually as a result of everyone

placed at  on the girls cutest boys list clyde briefly starts going out with red before breaking up with her in favor of bebe although clyde seemed to have been romantically interested in her it seems
