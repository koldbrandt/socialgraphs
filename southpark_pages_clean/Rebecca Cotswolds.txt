trousers Her hair is rather curly and is held back at each side by two round red barrettes parting her bangs  When she first appeared in the episode her coats collar briefly changed to a white one

than a typical fourth graderRebecca and Kyle playing surgeonRebecca as a slut after kissing Kyle    Though she is intelligent and studious as well Rebecca is naive and sheltered from the ways of the world and rather introverted Her awkward behavior and reclusive personality stem from her lack of social life  She tends to stammer a lot her voice almost constantly quiver and shake in a flat tone and seems to shy away from eye contact One of her major quirks is her tapping and clasping of her hands together and when spelling she opens them to whisper the letters of a word into them before she says them out loud Typically when she is not speaking she is biting her lower lip She also tends to shake much like  but not as severe  She had no idea what love was or even how to kiss considering

crush on Rebecca not long after meeting her she remained clueless about his interaction He attempted to serenade her with a  but she did not understand its purpose and when he first tried to talk to

final word that Rebecca is asked to spell is littoral which she spells incorrectly as LITORAL but she and her brother Mark still win the spelling bee as her answer is labeled as correct by the mayor
