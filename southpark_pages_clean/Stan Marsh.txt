named    since its beginning the series has had a running gag where when kenny is killed stan will announce oh my god youheshetheywe killed kenny kyle will then respond youthatthosewere bastards or vice versa  stans oftenused catchphrase during the early seasons was dude this is pretty fucked up right here which originated in the second  short though the profanity was bleeped out in recent s however this catchphrase has faded  in many s stan sums up the s main points in a small speech that often begins with you know i learned something today however it is more common for kyle to do it and a few other characters such as cartman and the  have as well stan is often shown with his hands in his coat pockets as he walks or when in deep thought  in the later s stan also has a habit of pinching the bridge of his un nose and shutting his eyes tightly when frustrated or exasperated saying phrases such as oh no a good example of this is in  where he does this motion when on the phone with  another example is in  when he does it all the way home from the set of wheel of fortune his mother is also  doing the motion in that scene he also does it the whole time when the reporter is talking to randy in  the gesture seems to be a learned habit developed by his constant frustration with his parents kyle also has a mannerism like this often closing his eyes when stressed this is not uncommon with stan and kyle often throughout the series being criticized as having the same personality  stan often groans awawww when he is upset or in disbelief which seems to be an inherited habit his father does this sometimes as well this is the same catchphrase  used in the  sports comedy film baseketball  if he agrees with someone or is unsure of something he will often state sure or yeah in a very dull unimpressed manner whenever he gets mad frustrated or gets dragged into something he often says goddamnit not to be confused with cartmans catchphrase aw goddamn it often in school he would say oooooh with a slightly higher pitched tone than his normal voice he will often express shock with jesus christ this is evident in  and    ecoterrorismbreaking and entering attempts to save  lives by stealing them from  and locks him cartman kyle and  in his room originally it technically is not terrorism but soon cartman gives demand for a missile an arsenal of weapons and the name for

law existed  arsonframing in  he and the others got  to set a fire in their preschool classroom and frame trent for the crime and in  however both of these arsons were accidental and unintentional and therefore do not count on his criminal record  filing a false police report in  he lied to the police about his parents and  abusing him  hitandrun in  stan and cartman drove a boat into a beaver dam which resulted in the flooding of  and the deaths of hundreds of millions despite the population of the town being only  it was also reported that people were looting raping and resorting to cannibalism which is a stretch however this was also an accident because stan did not know that this accident would go very far and does not count on his criminal record  piracy in  he sinks a japanese boat however this does not count because the whale wars show was supported by national television  violation of firearm lawsthreatening with a deadly weapon in  stan held kyles head at gunpoint and began to threaten him before revealing that he was the one who defecated in the school urinal simply to avoid missing out on recess he was eventually punished by  for it  attempted murder

order to give  a resurrection he has also been known at attempting to murder  at his grandpas request however he unintentionally attempts these assisted suicides  murder in  he and cartman killed many

to donate his kidney to a dying kyle stan tries to take it by force by breaking into his house and removing it with a saw however cartman outsmarts him by using the kidney blocker  to prevent this  unlicensed surgery in  he kyle and cartman preformed unlicensed liposuction on butters with a hose in order to get him thinner in hopes of getting money from a weight loss scam they even framed butters by simply running away and hiding causing yet another grounding for butters from his parents  theft cartman misled him into stealing a boat which ends up breaking a beaver dam but this is mostly cartmans fault  black marketing in  stan came up with a plan with the boys in breaking into any rich kids house and placing a tooth under their pillow and have their parents place money under their pillow only for them to steal it from them afterwards though this idea was already used by a boy named  who started a business in doing these and ended up joining his business thought one of the members of the  suspected this and was later caught by them but was not punished for due to kyles rather unusual altering reality abilities since this is black marketing this act was illegal and branded on his criminal record  underage smoking he along with cartman kenny and kyle smoked in order to not be like the antismoking group   underage drinking and alcoholism he was given alcohol by a group of people who supposedly had  because they all literally saw the world as shit they consistently make stan drink to do missions and although stan later said he was through with that group he still had a bottle of whiskey in his drawer however he had few alternatives because he apparently requires alcohol to cure himself of his cynicism  indecent exposure in  stans awareness video about bullying fails and the school ends up being sued by  stan resorts to going to  stripping his clothes and masturbating  in public though he was never arrested for this act and this rather amused san diegos populace he performed this act again in  when he successfully raised awareness of how horrible ziplining was for him  property damage in  stan and the rest of the fourth grade boys except for kenny destroy all of cartmans electrical devices into believing he was  later on he and the other boys regretted what they did when they figured out that cartman was not skankhunt   stan has been shown to be quite able to drive in quite a few s despite his age and height such as in  with kenny operating the gas and brake pedals  he piloted santas backup sleigh after santa was shot down over iraq  when he drove randy to the virgin mary statue and  when he drove a modified bus through the hordes of homeless and then lured them away to california   like the other   boys stan is also rarely grounded he usually does not understand why he gets grounded after doing something that causes him to be grounded and unlike the other boys stans grounding limit is usually determined by a random time by his parents and is usually not set to two to three weeks stan has been grounded on the following occasions    for sneaking out of his house to go nebraska with the other boys   stan was grounded for two weeks by sharon marsh for going to see the rrated film  which caused kennys death when tried to imitate a stunt  in the film   stan was grounded for ten months for masturbating his dog  in front of his familys book club during one of their meetings his grounding was immediately lifted when randy and sharon found out that stan had no knowledge of sexual education   for stealing the baby cows from  ranch   for smoking outside school but it was not mentioned   stan was grounded for calling the people of the future goobacks which was a timecist slur in a fast food restaurant his grounding was lifted after randys job was stolen by one of these people from the future   stan was grounded for supposedly defecating in a mans garden however kyle and cartman were the real culprits and framed stan so the kids wanting playstation  consoles on black friday would be leaderless he later sneaked out infuriating his mother who called randy who was more concerned that stan was in the mall during the deadly black friday rush   stan shows his leadership skills as pirate captain marsh of the sea shepherd in  he sinks several of the japanese boats to protect the whales and dolphins in

captainquarterback in football as  in  when the boys are playing police in  stan acts in the role of a lead detective during the investigations although there is no specific leader within his primary group of friends stan is often the one to motivate the other boys due to his moral beliefs as  in s such as       music in earlier s such as  and  stan began to show an aptitude for music he is also shown to be capable of writing music as  in   in  he and  started a boyband group named  they made a video for the song  and performed it at the   in  he was  playing guitar he was also  playing a guitar in  where he wrote and performed   in  his father taught him how to line dance to the song achy breaky heart by billy ray cyrus he and the rest of  participated successfully in a dance competition with   in  the boys formed a rock band called  the group refused to play their music in a protest of illegal music downloading on the internet  stan has been shown to be able to play  very well in  he was able to successfully achieve his goal of scoring  points with kyle in cooperative mode  in  he and the boys sang  to a large crowd of homeless people in an effort to drive them away from    in  and  the boys formed a peruvian flute band with  they played  at an outdoor mall in colorado where they were arrested by the department of homeland security  in  and  stan was shown to be a talented vocalist  in  in an effort to become more popular like  he and the boys performed a musical number similar to those of high school musical  in  his musical talents were shown again where he was shown to have written and directed the musical video for  a lipdub video aimed to stop bullying  in  he is shown singing  in the cissies bathroom  in  stan forms a heavy metal band called  which consists of him as the lead singer kenny as bassist butters as the lead guitarist and jimmy as the drummer  sports stan is quite athletically proficient and is regularly the captain or star player of his schools sports teams except in basketball where kyle is the best player in the school and dodgeball where  is the best player he was the quarterback of the school football team in  in baseball stan is  hitting home runs and is the pitcher though this is rare in professional baseball and apparent captain of  s team in  he and the other boys also play baseball in  he was also a member of the   dodgeball team that won the world championship and was on the peewee hockey team when he was  years old revealed in  stan also coached a  that  and showed he quit from hockey after failing to win a hockey game for the team on a breakaway his favorite sports team regarding the setting colorado is the  he also manages to go from a beginner skier to a nearprofessional in only two days in the   thanks to the timely use of a montage the  ends with him successfully skiing the k the most dangerous run in america in order to beat a much older man who repeatedly insulted him and challenged him to the run he also tries out for the   wrestling team in  but leaves after the coach makes butters do a gay move on cartman in the  he goes on to form a wrestling league with the other boys  weaponry for his age stan  proficient with weaponry in  he was able to hold an m assault rifle but did not actually use it and in  he was able to get hold of a handgun in  stan wields a pair of tonfa in  stan was able to take a flare gun and fire a flare into the fuel storage of a japanese whaling ship resulting in the whole ship blowing up he commandeered the sea shepard in the same  and sunk a fleet of japanese whaling ships with a rather impressive arsenal for a yearold including molotov cocktails and a large caliber deck gun his proficiency is probably a result of his  influence he was also able to kill  in the   also in  he uses the sword of a thousand truths successfully however this is in a video game he also broke into a building while wielding and firing an uzi gun at random areas of the building while intoxicated in   voice acting in  stan changes his voice in order to get into cartmans theme  cartmanland pretending to be a child named mick ganer in  he changed his voice to sound like cartman in order to finish a christmas short the two of them are also voiced by the same person trey er   stan is mostly shown wearing a brown jacket with a red collar a blue hat with a red puffball and rim and blue jeans under his jacket he either wears a red and blue baseball shirt or a white tshirtvneck he also wears a blue  shirt to bed and a green suit for special occasions in some s it is clear he has black hair like his father  when his hat is partially or completely removed  this was first  in   all of the boys hats are removed and their hair is  for an extended period during the shower room scene in  although kennys head is only  from behind stan also apparently has blue eyes as noted by kyle when butters draws their cartoon forms in  but this is uncertain because kyle said it was similar because he had a sharper nose so it could have been a mistake  in  he was portrayed with brown eyes so odds are it was butters error when his eyes were blue even at a young age stan has always worn his red and blue hat as shown in  and even sleeps with it on  in  he ranked third in the initial corrupt list of which boy was cutest however he was not mentioned among those who had to change places due to the corruption so it is possible that he remained the third cutest boy behind  who was actually in the bottom five somewhere and   in the  he had a different appearance his hat was the same but it was fully red he also had a dot as a nose and his jacket was blue  in the future timeline set in  his hair is graying on the sides and he has a fiveo clock shadow he wears a red longsleeved shirt with brown vest blue pants and black shoes     stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys for example in  he finds it difficult to see kenny in his ill state and in  he becomes depressed after losing his girlfriend to  also in  stan is the only one who stopped eating meat completely when the boys found that veal was actually tortured baby cow meat however in some s he does not seem to care when people die as in  and   stan is often very moral this is evident in  when he kenny  and butters challenged the character  and her shop of alternative medicine in  when he helped battle s suicidal cult and in  where he accuses the psychic medium  of being a fake in this  he also gained possession of his own show while trying to prove that cold reading was fake and battled with john edward in a psychic showdown  he also showed some heroism in  by stating he would gladly donate a kidney to kyle even if it hurt a whole lot in  he was also the only one in   to stand up and help whales and dolphins that were being slaughtered by the japanese he was angry that the cast of whale wars was not doing enough to help whales and dolphins and took matters into his own hands it also shows stan is a whale and dolphin lover and he tells the japanese that it was a cow and a chicken that nuked hiroshima not a whale and a dolphin in order to save them all being wiped out by the japanese  he is usually the one who is unaffected by the many scams cults and mass influences that   has been subjected to and has a knack for seeing through falsely glorified practices and celebrities in  and  he is the only one of the boys shown to believe in scams cults and that an alien makes everyone see things normal conversely sometimes kyle takes on this role and it is stan who is the gullible one such as in  or the metrosexual trend in the    however stan has been shown to have an overwhelmingly clearer understanding of scams and corporate corruption than anyone else in   and has an especially good grasp of the dangers of cults it is notable that he has a tendency to ridicule make enemies out of andor bring shame to a very large number of celebrities that are shown in a poor light within the show this may be because his father stans major adult influence has shown to be rather incompetent and immature so stan is suspicious and distrustful of adults  stan and kyles personalities tend to be similar especially in the earlier seasons but are not quite interchangeable and they have developed more distinct and complex personalities during the shows run still they are considered the closest friends out of the four though cartman and kenny do not have a close bond of their own  stans depression is also a recurring theme throughout the show he became terribly depressed when wendy broke up with him in  briefly joining the  stan also became incredibly depressed and adopted a cynical world view in  and  where everything to him literally sounded and looked like shit in  he uses alcohol to make the world seem happier  stan may suffer from asthma as an inhaler was shown among the things cartman claims in  although this was never mentioned in the series again  stan is an avid animal lover  he gets a dog in  he resists the influence of his uncle jimbo to hunt in  he mentions this in  became a  member in  although he had the choice of joining them or being killed tried to save baby cows in  and attempted to return a goat to its rightful owners in  although wellintentioned these interventions often lead him and his friends into serious trouble stan as well as the rest of the boys from th grade also went to mexico and managed to get the mexican space program to take an orca to the moon in a bid to save it with all the kids in   having been led to believe he was a killer whale from the moon in  in  after he and cartman crash a boat into a beaver dam and swim to shore seeing the boat blow up stan says i hope we didnt hurt any beavers in  he briefly turned to vegetarianism but he quickly gave it up when he was plagued by a disease that literally turned him into a pussy sprouting actual vaginas on his body a disease called  he also sets out to save the whales and dolphins from the japanese in  it is revealed in  that he is afraid of snakes  stan is shown to sympathize with others most evidently  in the   in which he partially defends  because he feels sorry for him due to him not having any friends however when this pity backfires and lands him in a cave where al gore almost unintentionally drowns him kyle cartman and kenny he lashes out and brings al gore into a cold hard reality shouting stay away from us asshole i only felt sorry for you because you didnt have any friends but now i know why you dont have any friends you just use manbearpig as a way of getting attention for yourself because youre a loser this does not affect al gore however as he dons a cape and says he will go and make a movie starring himself an inconvenient truth ironically al gore is also responsible for the deaths of stan and everyone else in  even though they were revived by butters  when angered stan is often quite reluctant to continuedo anything that will further contribute to the obscurity or direness of the situation this is shown in  after he finds out  whom he helped were giving birth to the  he decided not to attempt to set things right although did eventually after much nagging from the s narrator also in this  we found out that stan was a christian technically though this was not him  just a fictional version of him created by eric cartman for his christmas story for the first seven seasons of the show stans sporadic girlfriend was  in the early days of the series a running gag would be that stan would throw up out of nervousness whenever wendy spoke to him as the show progressed however the stanwendy storyline diminished greatly in the penultimate  of the seventh season  wendy had  tell stan that she breaks up for token causing stan to go into extreme depression and join the  he recovered thanks to butters who was dealing with his own heartbreak and had decided that he would rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid stan eventually got over the breakup by telling wendy youre a bitch and giving token the middle finger while saying token right here buddy wendy has played a much smaller part in the series since this  it became apparent that stan had some lingering feelings for wendy in the   when he grew insanely jealous of kyle working with her he however decided to show her up by responding to her compliments with as if i give a crap about what you think wendy at the end of  however stan and wendy reconciled they inadvertently have an adventure together and at the end wendy admits to having a good time with stan and believes he has changed since they were last together they lean in to kiss but in a nearexact copy of a scene at the end of  stan pukes on wendy their status as boyfriend and girlfriend is affirmed in  also in the season thirteen   butters tries to get wendy to work for him in his kissing company referring to her as a bitch and stan says butters dude you cant call my girlfriend a bitch and threatens to hurt him if he continues stan is shown to be a bully at times when he and cartman mention that they sat on a kid and farted on him he and cartman also beat up a random third grader when they enter fourth grade he also threatens butters for attempting to steal the video from him in  while trying to get to the video store  stan is frequently embarrassed or infuriated at the stupidity of his parents and the other adults of the town and he often goes against what his parents do this is prominently shown in  when he finds out about the actor portraying his future self and goes so far as to trick randy to cut the hand off of the actor to try and get them to admit they lied in  the escalating paranoia over child abductions leads the parents to send all the towns children away in fear that they the parents will abduct their own kids as the children wander off on their own stan remarks to kyle dude sometimes i think our parents are really stupid and as they rejoin their families at the conclusion of the  jesus christ dude theyve done some stupid crap before but jesus christ in  he admits to breaking a beaver dam and the adults assume that this was instead a message urging them not to waste energy on pointing the finger of blame after several failed attempts to explain that it actually was him who broke the dam through everyone saying i broke the dam he shouted i broke the fucking dam and explained the exact sequence of events without any effect on the adults the rather displaced cynicism that he exhibits when dealing with adults as well as his inability to be impressed by celebrities or fads may also come from the fact that due to his parents he has probably never respected or trusted adults also in crme fraiche he says you guys my dad is retarded but he is not that retarded when cartman presents his idea to stan on how to trick randy into not wanting to cook  in  stan was thought to be the leader of scientology having scored the highest thetan levels since  and was quickly approached by  whom stan called an average actor after hearing this tom cruise shouted im a failure in the eyes of the prophet and locked himself in stans closet after unsuccessfully attempting to get him out stan shouts down the stairs to randy dad tom cruise wont come out of the closet which is a reference to the rumors that tom cruise was gay with coming out of the closet meaning when a gay man admits he is gay stan is later told that scientology is fake and that if he writes anything almost everyone would believe it and he could make up to  million later on when he reads his new writings to his loving public his morality objected to it and he told everyone that scientology was fake and that it was a wrong way to answer the many questions stan was then sued by almost everyone including cruise and the head of the church without anyone taking any action until he lost his temper shouting well go on then sue me  in  he is the only kid in the school who finds the option of voting between a  and a  ridiculous he is beleaguered by kyle the school officials and his parents eventually bringing  to   to tell him about the vote or die campaign and then chased stan around town with a gun and literally told him to vote or die he is later banished from town for not voting and is rescued by  members the leader of which tells him that in actuality all elections are between a douche and a turd which convinces him to go back to town to vote  in  he is disgusted with the passion of the christ calling it a snuff film and going along with kenny to s house to get their money back mel gibson turns out to be insane and rabidly masochistic and attacks the two of them with a gun in a manner reminiscent of daffy duck after stan calls him daffy stan and kenny then steal the money from gibsons wallet and flee back to   pursued by him later when gibson asserts that stan cannot say that his film sucks because it is saying that christianity sucks stan counters by saying that christianity is fine but focusing on how people died ends up with really bad results convincing the town that mel gibson was wrong all along  in  stan is led to believe he is the only boy of the four that has not yet had his period and is left out by the other three due to him not being mature enough he later uses the only question available every two millennia to ask  who had come down to earth briefly why he has not given him his period after a long pause god states the obvious that he is a boy and should not get periods the  ends with everyone trying to kill stan for using the only question on something so dumb  in  he was made a member of a rabbitworshipping cultlike group called the  which his father grandfather and the entire male side of his family has been members in for generations  after his tenth birthday in  stan became extremely cynical viewing almost everything as shit and even seeing people poop out of their mouths his cynicism becomes so serious his friendship with the other characters is destroyed his parents also separate causing stan to move out of his childhood home though it was shown in the next   in  the followup to  stan is shown to still be depressed everything is still viewed as shit to him he rides the bus alone and  uninterested in everything around him later outbursting in class mr mackey tries to talk stan out of his depression to which stan breaks down crying wanting everything to go back to what it was  incorrectly assumes that stan developed asperger syndrome from his flu shot last year sharon brings stan to a clinic to get help which is a front for a group who sees the world as stan does the temporary cure for stans cynicism is alcohol which stan takes to see the old world finally happy again stan observes the old world watches a movie then sees kyle to attempt to reestablish and save their friendship kyle coldly tells stan they need to move on angering a drunken stan who gives kyle the finger saying fuck you kyle youre a piece of shit as kyle dejectedly walks away stan says kyle i love you only to tell kyle off again stan is later captured by a group of restaurant owners trying to shut  down at sniper point the group forces stan to ask kyle what the secret ingredient is after an ensuing shoot out stan refuses anymore of the alcohol saying he would be happy with everything going forward stan was optimistic of a new life new adventures until randy drives up telling him everything worked out with his mom stan is  stunned as sharon and randy move back in and he shares a picnic with wendy the closing moments of the  show everything has returned to normal kyle kenny and cartman come in his room saying they going off to see zookeeper  zookeepier stan chases after them to watch it but not before taking a sip of whiskey he hid in his room    randy is stans father they generally have a good relationship although stan often gets annoyed by randys obsessiveness this is especially true with the  pushiness and melodramatic antics randy also tends to be very naive which exasperates stan all the more like the rest of the family the relationship was getting bad due to randy videotaping everything the family did in  but stan may have been indifferent due to the peruvian flute bands stan also dislikes his fathers stubbornness alcoholism and general stupidity  outside of randys antics stan seems to enjoy being around his father randy taught stan how to dance in  and randy went to extra measures to help stan win in  although the extra lengths of cheating may have simply been to defeat a rival family  randy seems to want to live his life through stan to an extend but also to prevent stan from his failures in  randy was enraged at stan attempting to form a boy band because he first hand had a taste of fame and failure from it in  randy woke up from a nightmare of stan missing the winning shot in his peewee hockey game and was emotionally unstable at the end when stans team lost to the red wings  randy does seem to want to have a stronger relationship with stan in  he logs onto stans teamspeak during the battle with the nerd and asks to play with stan and his friends despite him being weaker than all of the th graders characters in  randy sees the boys playing guitar hero and thinking they like playing guitar wants to teach them how to play the real instrument  in  randy tries to bridge another gap by listening to tweenwave while this serves as a chance for him to live his failed dreams he tries to share his passion for the music that stan and his friends hear but he cannot at the end of the  randy and sharon separate randy talks to a gloomylooking stan and he drives off with their house in his side mirror  later in  towards the end of the  when stan was finally ready to accept change randy and sharon reconciled with everything going back to the way they used to be with the only exception of stan still drinking alcohol which was not referenced again   she is stans mother his relationship with her is often more stable than that with randy however she has told him that she considers his happiness and shellys happiness secondary to her own yet this was likely a joke on parents breaking up because sharon has never demonstrated this behavior aside from in  she did freak out when stan was missing in  he had been arrested by the military taking the arguments with randy about the video camera to the next level stans jacket is almost the same as s shirt stan is very similar to sharon in the way he is level headed and it is likely that they have a good loving relationship with each other   she is his violent and abusive teenage sister she frequently insults him by calling him and his friends turds and physically harms him however she refuses to let anyone else harm him as  in  when stan asked for her advice on what to do about the bully  after asking for her help she seemed to genuinely listen to his problem also stan even stated at one point that she used to be somewhat nicer to him before she got her headgear installed she sometimes is nice to stan but would later prefer to run him over with a lawnmower however she has not been violent to stan since    he is stans paternal grandfather he is  confined to a wheelchair and a tad senile he continually addresses stan as billy and in occasionally asks stan to kill him it turns out that this is a family trait involving the men in the marsh family dating back at least a couple of generations he is said to have had the same relationship with his own grandfather   stan has very little contact with his grandmother due to the fact she is hospitalized with a debilitating illness and also separated from grandpa marsh however she is an avid  user and often has her son randy bully stan into checking his facebook in regards to messages and posts she sends him   he is stans maternal uncle   she is stans greataunt on his mothers side of the family she was first  and killed in    sy is stans dog who is a homosexual he has had many gay relationships to stans chagrin including one with s dog  in  sy made its second appearance in  during which stan played red rocket by masturbating sy its third appearance was in  where its fur was used to make butters look like a dog   the goldfish aunt flo gave stan and who killed many people including her and kenny and framed his owner stan for it sharon nearly went insane covering up these murders in an effort to protect her precious handsome little boy   roy was stans stepdad after sharon divorces randy in  she immediately marries roy though it is actually more likely as presented from the timeline that his parents were starting out on a trial separation roy is shown to be extremely emotional and possibly bipolar particularly whenever stan attempts to speak where one moment he tried to be friendly with stan he immediately begins screaming that stan is ungrateful and does not let up on him he seems obsessed with cutting firewood forcing stan to do it for an entire day sharon and roy stayed together until sharon reconciles with randy in stans clubhouse and the two of them proceed to have sex roy meanwhile is held captive in a beartrap set by stan what happened to him afterward is unknown but it can be assumed that he died while being hung from the beartrap   stan is one of the leaders of the male student population in   elementary and therefore is well acquainted with most of the students he is one of the few characters that always gets along with the girls and was voted third cutest by them in  he is respected and liked by pretty much everyone he also has gone out of his way to make peace with his fellow students like when he tries to make things right with  after randy says the nword on wheel of fortune thinking he would win money in     stan and kyle have been great friends since the very beginning of the show stan seems to be the only character in the show who gets along with all of the main and background characters they have been known to end up working together in certain adventures such as in  and are often dragged into the same circumstances due to this such as in  stan has saved kyles life on several occasions without hesitation most notably in  and has once stated that he does not want kyle to die until he does he nearly always defends kyle when cartmans hatred of him goes over the top such as in  and  stan often becomes anxious about kyle when he is tricked by various scams or becomes immersed in his hatred of cartman bending over backwards to encourage or reassure kyle convince him otherwise or to get him out of trouble  they are frequently  together or talking to each other even in the absence of cartman or kenny making them rather like twins also in the opening credits of the show they sing the same lines together however their friendship has hit bumps in a number of s such as          and  they have reconciled onscreen in all of these s with the exceptions of   and  although all those times they were shown to be friends in the next  the   focuses more than any other on their friendship as a big argument between the two forms the major conflict of the story however in the end they reconcile with no lasting damage done to the friendship  stan also had a great deal of concern when kyle was voted the ugliest boy in the class in  their friendship is so strong that cartman calls them fags and has even commented you wanna get a room so you can make out for a while in  it is also notable that in  kyle was the only person who could hear stans voice in his head when stan was trapped in imaginationland though it was most likely due the shock he got from the portal   even though stan does not really consider cartman a friend the two are often  together in  stan and cartman hang out at the boating rack and cartman even comments that it is great that they are hanging out with each other without kyle implying that cartman at least would prefer to have a closer friendship with stan stan meanwhile seems to be more accepting or at least tolerant of cartman than kyle and even kenny at times such as in  while kyle is immediately distrustful of cartmans truthfulness in his claim that he cannot control the actions of his hand which has seemed to take on a life of its own stan gives cartman the benefit of the doubt and admits that with all the stuff that happens in   cartman could be telling the truth  in  cartman made stan the protagonist of his christmas story he is described as the boy in a red poofball hat showing that cartman sees stan as a heroic figure of sorts in  stan votes for cartmans mascot instead of kyles much to kyles dismay also in  when stan  to be the only boy who has not gotten their period cartman reassures him that he will get it one day  in  when stan was hospitalized with vaginitis cartman seemed concerned and was relieved that stan was saved just in time this is a rare occasion when cartman has put his friends in front of his own personal gain as he helped stan stop people from eating veal even though he did not get anything in return for it and would be starving himself for days he also tells the fbi negotiator that theres a sick kid up here referring to stan when negotiating to release the calves showing that he is worried about stans health  it is implied that in  that stan considers cartman his second best friend when stan and kyle fell out in the  stan claimed that his new best friend was cartman as did kyle but they both claimed that cartman sucks as a best friend when they made up this could be because stan really values his best friendship with kyle either way it is clear that stan does consider cartman as a close friend also in  cartman wants to kick kyle and tweek out of the group but does not want to kick out stan which implies that cartman likes having stan as a friend  however in  cartman declares that he hates stan because stan loves animals even so in  all three boys defriend stan after he becomes the leader of scientology as the boys leave cartman turns to stan and says i still hate kyle more than you the two can also be said to be friends because they admitted to being friends in front of the home school kids  in some s stan is shown having a strong hatred for cartman even if cartman is not doing anything in  when the cyborg says he has to kill cartman stan asks if he can do it and prepares to shoot cartman before the cyborg decides against the idea although stan is much more tolerant of cartman than kyle is he often holds cartman in very high contempt for his unacceptable behavior in  stan and cartman were  playing  together hinting that despite cartmans behaviors stan still considers him a friend however in  when mr mackey claimed that cartman killed himself for being fat when the school faculty threw him under the bus stan was more concerned with keeping  from posting its biggest story than with any injuries cartman may have suffered   although kenny and stan do not seem to share the same bond that stan and kyle do stan sees kenny as a close friend in  out of the  boys stan has the hardest time dealing with kenny dying and cannot even bear to see him in the hospital when stan finally realizes that kenny passed on for good he feels like he is kennys worst friend until they hear about cartmans selfishness the two boys often hang out with one another when cartman and kyle get into their arguments and stan and kenny do not want to listen to it such as in  in  stan and kyle fight against cartman to not have kennys feeding tube removed to save kennys life  however in  when all hope seems lost to save kyle and stan breaks down crying in front of kenny because of kyles impending death he does not seem to care or even acknowledge the fact that kenny dies all the time this angers kenny and makes him leave stan to go home  which in turn causes his death by walking under a falling piano and even then stan still fails to notice or care  during the first five seasons stan would almost always be the first to react in horror by saying oh my god they killed kenny after one of kennys classic deaths of course immediately after kyle would say you bastards and he would not acknowledge kenny again after that the only times that stan would treat kennys death with immediate unconcern was when he was preoccupied with something important such as in  and  in  both stan kyle and even  show a complete lack of horror or concern for kennys death after he eats dozens of antiacid tablets and drinks water at which point he explodes instead all of them laugh and clap finding that particular death a good one  in  kenny as mysterion tries to convince stan and kyle about the truth of his deaths and that they never remember even to the point of shooting himself to prove it much to mysterions dismay this does not work as no one who sees it remembers    a recurring topic in the early seasons was stans relationship with wendy testaburger her first appearance in  shows stan going on a date with her a running gag in the early seasons of their relationship showed stan vomiting out of nervousness whenever she tried to say anything to him or kiss him stan is the first of the four main boys  getting his first kiss during a flashback in  but not the first to actually do so  wendy dumps stan for token in  which drives stan into a state of depression and even causes him to briefly join a local goth clique after this the two spent two seasons barely on speaking terms and rarely saw each other eyetoeye however the two still had feelings for each other lingering in the air as  in  in which stan worries about getting paired with wendy on a school project and is jealous when she ends up paired with kyle however at the end of  the  finale the two both work together to expose the secret corruption of wendys school listmaking society and ultimately reconcile at the end in a near copy of the end scene of  wendy is about to kiss him when he vomits in her face this was the last time he threw up on her even when she kissed him a few times later in the series  their reconciliation was confirmed in the    in which they pair up at their school field trip by holding hands refusing to let go for a long time and stan confirms wendy is once again his girlfriend in  he is concerned about wendy fighting cartman but feels that he could not do anything about it however he cheers her on when she beats him up  concerns stans efforts not to lose wendy to a popular boy at school called  by singing songs based on the style from high school musical despite wendys reassurance that she will not leave him and that the whole school likes bridon wendy also kisses stan on his cheek when she closes her locker and leaves and stan does not throw up it is shown however in  that after the second time they resumed their relationship she does not plan on letting him go for any other girl she even goes so far as to judge him by his  account rather than him in real life should she see his status say single and or see any other girls comments on his facebook page  in  she becomes increasing concerned about stans cynicism and tries to talk kyle into talking with stan about it but he refuses both stan and wendy are shown at the end of the  sitting on a picnic blanket presumably reconciling their relationship once again  in  stan breaks up with wendy due to him starting a startup company with kyle cartman kenny and  however they get back together at the end of   in  wendy breaks up with stan due to the actions of internet troll  all of the girls stated that his actions spoke for the boys opinions  in  stan is  in a restaurant with wendy promising her he will change bill cosby points out that if he is only changing to get her back then he is being selfish stan tells wendy not to give up on boys because i miss you wendy before wendy can respond butters berates stan calling him a traitor and ruins the moment   stan is the only one of the four who has never contracted a terminal illness as both kyle and cartman contracted aids in  and kenny contracted muscular dystrophy in  stan has been shown to be an animal rights activist he protected baby calves from slaughter in  joined  though only to survive because if he did not do so he would have starved in the wilderness in  and headed the  crew for a while in  in   the warcraft

twittercom however at the start of the  when viewing stans game screen you can read stans character name is staniscool before  stan was never  without his hat even when he was in bed stan is the last one of  to have a supernatural power at one point kyle has disappeared and briefly became an omniscient being by studying existentialism in  cartman has the ability to see and hear ghosts and the ability to fire electricity at people in  kenny has had the power of immortality throughout the series stan obtains momentaneous powers like flying apparent telekinesissuperforce and projecting fire from hands and mouth when  possesses him in order to fight  in  stan has said dude this is pretty fucked up right here on at least three christmas specials   and  he says these when something strange happens in  he says it when   in  he says it when him and the others go to celebrate christmas with  and in  he says it when  is shot by an iraqi stan has a somewhat stronger digestive system than many others do as shown in  since he is able to eat at chipotle without bleeding out his ass afterwards cartman even remarks that stan has a golden rectum of the gods stan has asthma in  cartman takes
