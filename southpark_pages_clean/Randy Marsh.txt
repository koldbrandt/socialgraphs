    is the son of  and  the husband of  and the father of  and  He makes his debut in the  episode  and is voiced by   Despite being a geologist with a doctorate he is generally portrayed as an absentminded idiot driving many episode plots in the later seasons though this was later revealed to be due to him being unhappy over his marriage However in earlier seasons he was calmer and more levelheaded often providing advice to the boys In  he divorced his wife and moved away However in  he reconciled with Sharon and remarried therefore getting their old house back Since  Randy has been running the  hemp farming business  Randy is named after and based upon s father Randy Parker who is also a geologist     is shown to be an actual liberal He often fights for huge changes and only turns to conservatism when he is in a major problem goes into an obsession stance or misunderstands something His liberalism is first seen in  when he tells the people of  that they have to fart all the time in order to avoid being burned alive He was also shown to support the people of the future in  and thinks of them just as normal people He even grounds Stan for calling these people Goobacks in a fast food restaurant but his grounding was lifted after Randy loses his job to one of those people from the future In  Randys political views are confirmed after he is seen supporting  In  he strongly supported s run for presidency but made it clear this was an unusual occurrence and was only supporting her because of his dislike of  although he is briefly enticed by Garrisons run in    As first seen in  Randy has a very unhealthy addiction to masturbation He often masturbates without thinking straight and becomes obsessive on whatever he is masturbating on In  he was watching  take her bra off Later in  he sneaks in the room where the internet is hidden then goes on it and starts looking at unusual pornographic material In Crme Fraiche he was beating it to cooking shows This soon became an obsession and it forced Sharon to give Randy an old fashioned in order to end his obsession and save their marriage    In   and  it was hinted that Randy has a drinking problem  also mentioned it in  at one point stating Looks like Stans dads been hitting the bottle again His problem was more closely examined in  after he was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving He got a DUI and his drivers license was suspended The judge made him go around schools including  to explain to kids why heavy drinking is bad and sentenced him to  weeks of  meetings As a result of the AA meetings Randy misunderstands the concept of alcoholism and believes that only spirituality can cure him of this  He has been depicted as everything from a casual drinker to a heavy alcoholic He still is not as bad as s father  as unlike the latter he is sober most of the time He also had a job until he got himself fired in  for a drunken tirade directed toward his boss It was revealed though that he was rehired as a geologist in  It appears  is a binge drinker  one who stays most of the time sober but drinks heavily at suitable instances He might have a family history of alcoholism because his son Stan was seen getting drunk in order to avoid his cynicism in   He was shown to still have a drinking problem in  and  although he denied this in both cases    Randy has an unhealthy attraction to marijuana going as far as to intentionally giving himself cancer just so he could get his hands on legal marijuana He tried many ways to get cancer such as smoking getting a tan and attaching cell phones to his face He eventually came up with the idea of sticking his testicles in a microwave as seen in  just to get weed Ten other men including  and  soon follow Randys example  Despite being drawn to marijuana in the aforementioned episode he seems to display some level of contempt for it in  as not only do he and Sharon hire someone to scare Stan from drugs he also is the one to defame marijuana at the end as he points out that the worst thing about pot is that one could be doing something better with their life instead of smoking it  Ultimately Randy purchases a hemp farm in  and gives up geology to begin his own marijuana business    It appears  is very musically talented and occasionally the show states that he once had dreams of being a famous musician He is a good singer

becoming disillusioned with the music industry and their use of holograms   It is also implied in  that Randy and his wife Sharon used to be  and they met at Woodstock in  If this was the case though they would be in their midforties to midfifties However this may have been simply a cutaway joke Also Randy and Sharon were revealed to have met in a treefort playing Truth or Dare in   Randy tells the other adults in town at the end of  that he studied  in college possibly minoring in the subject He then speaks it to the children who have joined a tribe of Mongolians However it appears that he

girlfriend and his family and immediately joined a boy band The name of his band was The Ghetto Avenue Boys which is meant to be a parody of The Backstreet Boys They had a hit single You Got It and they made millions living in a big mansion with dozens of women sharing his bed with him at once But one year later all of the group members were fired for being too old for a boy band despite the fact that Randy was only nineteen at the time Randy was in debt to the studio and in order to make up for it he had to give up all of his possessions He then returned home at last and used up what money he had left resuming his education  An interesting thing to note is that Randy is shown to be very proficient at the guitar in  He also mentions in that episode that he knows how to play several famous rock songs on the guitar such as  by Kerry Livgren  Geologist  Ever since his first appearance he has been shown to be a geologist In later seasons notably in the  episode  he is known to be a worker for the United States Geological Survey He became famous for his theory on moderation in  and won the Nobel Prize Award for it He is often called upon to perform many scientific tasks due to his education and positions He usually is unable to perform the tasks despite the fact he is a geologist and thus has a high level of understanding of many areas of science including chemistry biology

smoking and even after discovering it was a volcanic eruption he casually finishes his coffee first He lost his job in  for verbally and physically abusing his boss and then punching him because he

geology as he has been referred to as Dr Marsh on two occasions once by a Republican Senator in  and once by himself in  while he was teaching children about penis measurement The Surgeon General

backyards killing many in the process so he and his coconspirers can corner the market on cannabis Unlicensed Slaughter In  after selling his own plantbased burgers cannabis edibles to boost business Randy and Towelie are manipulated into killing many cows by The Goo Man under the assumption that a ranch farmer is simply filling Randys farm with useless cows as Randy promoted veganism and plantbased foods making beef obsolete when The Goo Man actually paid him to help sabotage Randys business Since these are cows this can be seen as common slaughter but as Randy did not have a proper slaughterhouse set up this can be seen as unlicensed slaughter While this is illegal Randy only did this due to the fact that the cows were polluting his farm with their waste eating his crops and preventing him from harvesting his crops SaleDistribution of Recreational Marijuana Violation of the Controlled Substances Act Ever since  Randy has started a business which involves selling and distributing recreational marijuana to others While this is technically legal in the state of Colorado it is still a federal crime and it violates the US Controlled Substances Act Sale Production and Distribution of ContaminatedIllicit Substances In  while promoting his new cannabis strain the Halloween Special Randy sells cannabis contaminated with a hazardous chemical concoction of furniture polisher paint thinner bleach ammonia and antifreeze by his daughter Shelly He initially was going to discard it but after seeing that the concoction enhanced the cannabis Randy decided to sell it as planned but without examining it to see if what was safe for usage The contaminated cannabis was shown to have caused Randy and Towelie to have nightmarish hallucinations and was heavily implied by Mayor McDaniels to have poisoned people causing serious harm to everybody While Shelly is at fault for contaminating the product Randy is also accountable as he witnessed Shelly contaminate his product and decided to sell it anyway In  when Santa has the sale and purchase of alcohol banned during the holidays in an effort to decrease the towns amount of drunk driving the townspeople go to Randy for cannabis to use to help give them some holiday spirit As it was winter and his crops were dead Randy was left with the decision of selling old strains or combining them to make a new strain Since this was not good enough by Randys standards he decides to combine strains and then visibly lace them with cocaine When initially asked what the white substance was he said it is Just a little something extra for a special kick Later when Mayor McDaniels confronted him on what the white substance was Randy confirmed it was in fact cocaine and that Randy did not even know cocaine was illegal to begin with and that he could not just sell it to people without them knowing Immediately after Randy started protests to legalize cocaine for medicinal and recreational usage succeeding in making cocaine legal in seven US states including Colorado While cocaine distribution became legal after this whatever cocaine Randy had sold and distributed beforehand was both illegal and immoral Even after Randy had cocaine legalized there was massive collateral damage done to the town due to cocaine intoxication Bestiality In  it is revealed Randy had sex with a bat and a pangolin while he was in China together with  However this was because he was drunk with Mickey and thus intoxicated into having sex with the bat and pangolin   FilethumbleftRandys first appearance in  Randy wears a white shirt under a bluecyan jacket with two pockets on each side and the sleeves up he also wears black pants and black shoes His leftside pocket usually has a yellow a red and a blue pen with a pocket protector As of  Randy has been given a slightly more detailed redesign such as the pencil and pens in his chest pocket changing colors and no longer being depicted as simple lines  He has thick black hair with parted bangs and a thick black mustache both of which seem to evoke a s hairstyle In early episodes though his hairstyle was somewhat different see left Up until  he did not have a dimpled chin But in and after that episode he mysteriously developed one of course in the early stages of  many things changed  At bedtime Randy wears deep blue pajamas with a longsleeved shirt and gray slippers Though he appears slim and in shape when clothed he is rather flabby and has a protruding stomach as seen when naked Randy also has prosthetic testicles following the removal of his own due to his selfinduced testicular cancer as seen in s   In his special occasion outfit which consists of a white dress shirt a light blue tuxedo blue pants and a gold tie he has a gold handkerchief in his blue coat pocket In later seasons it changed to a brown tuxedo white dress shirt grey pants and a red tie  As of  Randy now wears a straw hat a blue plaid shirt underneath a brown hooded jacket a black belt with a gold buckle filthy greenishgray pants and muddy brown shoes  In  he had a gray beard and was wearing a red coat with white buttons and black suspenders  In the future timeline set in  Randy is now an elderly man with grey hair which is balding at the top He reverts back to his attire preceding  with the only differecnes being that he wears a light brown coat over his blue shirt and instead of black shoes he sports a pair of brown sandals with grey socks underneath      Randy is often portrayed as an intelligent but simultaneously dimwitted quick to think naive man while all the same a caring doting father However he is also obsessive and when he gets engrossed in something his personality turns to the exact opposite He becomes immature childish and dumb during the obsession phases He has a habit of being led astray by new fads or events like many of the characters All the same he has also been known to go completely against such things though his reasons are usually selfish and immature He will also try to do a heroic thing but will then be distracted due to a selfish reason as seen in  However this was caused by  because Randy ignored the psychiatrists wanting about Mackeys dream being so unstable Another aspect and common trait of Randy is that he will often take up a cause but they hypocritically abandon that cause or objective whenever he sees it as something that will damage his reputation or finds something else that will be beneficial for himself or his family Such instances of this are in  when he led the townspeople to abandon all material possessions and economic activities in order to please the economy but when Kyle decided to pay for everyones debt he was one of the people in line who chose to have his debt paid for immediately abandoning his previous beliefs Another instance is in  when he sought out Officer Barbrady to shoot kids who they thought were part of ISIS But when he found out that they were just playing ninjas and Officer Barbrady accidentally shot  he immediately blamed Officer Barbrady along with the Mayor and her staff When Officer Barbrady reminded Randy that hed told him to shoot some kids Randy insists that he was saying it as a question and tries to shift all the blame from him and target the very person hed sought out for help  Randy also seems to drink a lot of coffee shown carrying a cup in most episodes he is in at one point or another  Randy has a tendency to act very melodramatically Whenever things get surreal in the show and Randy is calling for his son he usually puts on an act of being very ill and weak and moaning Stans name out Staaaaaan Randy is also shown to be a hypochondriac as revealed by Stan in   In   reveals that Randy does not like chicken He also does not like cherry poptarts as he expressed disgust when  pointed out that those were the only ones left in   In  Randy can be seen strumming a guitar with his right hand he may therefore be righthanded  He is obsessive with a few things as evidenced with his video camera in  when he videotaped his father  in the bathtub Sharon Stan and Shelly eating dinner which is implied to have happened multiple times a  outside the house asking Stan to go outside next to them Sharon and Shelly watching CNN Sharon talking to the Broflovskis and Tuckers about their missing boys Sharon calling someone to help with the missing boys and the  Sharon frequently reprimanded him for doing this calling him an idiot at one point   Randy is shown to be very violent at times He often is in mobs and flips over s truck He chops off a  hand and perhaps kills him in order to stop Stan from knowing that he was a fake in  He is shown in the end of  fighting with  He is shown to be very violent again in  beating up rival baseball dads He shoots off a mans head when he fears the man is becoming homeless when homeless people take over the town He beats up a woman in  after she questions his theory about penis sizes implying that Randy is hostile to anyone who accuses him of having a small dick which also explains  personality He also gets sent to anger management and then takes over a FedEx building with Cartman   and  He also joins the civil war reenactors with Cartman and loots rapes and tortures  In  he was armed with a shotgun while hiding with other parents on top of the community center While he did not use his weapon against the surrounding homeless he did decapitate  as punishment for being homeless  In  he kills Winnie The Pooh in order to sell his weed in China     She is Randys wife They married as Randy was dressed as Christopher Columbus instead of an ordinary groom much to her dislike She seems to be more sensible than him at the best of times although they both are known to be very hotheaded on occasion In  they were constantly bickering and ultimately they divorce Randy then became an incompetent father who spent the whole time partying the nights away and never seemed to have time for his children At the end of the episode Sharon decided she still loved Randy and they had sex in Stans tree fort They then presumably remarried Up until this episode they had been inseparable from each other afterward they are still loving but their relationship is a bit more complicated In more recent seasons Sharon has become more annoyed with Randys overthetop and childish behavior such as the events of  where she freaks out and attacks him when he spends all his time playing with a video camera while the familys lives are in danger Even worse this turned out to be pointless as he had forgotten to put film in the camera In  they divorced due to his actions Sharon and Randy both confess to faking their happiness in their relationship However after communicating theyve become more aware of each others feelings and they reconcile in  and remarry    Stan is Randys son and youngest child Randy loves his son very much and goes out of his way to either protect or save him as shown in episodes    and  Stan however gets very annoyed and frustrated by Randys reckless and embarrassing behavior and usually only takes his advice because he feels obliged to do so  In  Stan got so irritated by the street party outside which was being led in large part by his father that he made a noise complaint All he could say when they tipped s car over was Jesus Christ and continued to watch in annoyed horror as his fathers action became steadily worse Things infact became even worse when Randy refused to help with s younger brother  who had fallen out of the window and Randy ended up getting fired from his job for acting like a drunkidiot towards his boss Also it may be noted that Stan did not want his parents to move back together in  this may be also taken as a sign that he does not like his fathers behavior In  Stan said Randy exaggerates every disease he gets However Stan sometimes thanks Randy when the latter helps him such as saying to him Youre the greatest in  when Randy got him disqualified from Baseball despite looking down on his behavior beforehand  Randy will also publicly vocally express his annoyance in certain incidences in which Stan was a part of most of the time being incredibly harsh in situations that do not call for it   FilethumbRandys daughter  Shelly is Randys daughter and elder child She is very violent to her younger brother Stan although she is very nice or at least indifferent whenever her parents are around Because of this Randy and Sharon have remained completely oblivious to her abusive nature and when Stan told them what she did they did not believe him Shelly however like Stan and Sharon often gets annoyed with her fathers behavior rolling her eyes but rarely saying anything other than Mom whats up Dads ass  In  Randy drove all the way to the musical to prevent Shelly from giving a blowjob to   Shelly does not feel like he loves her claiming that he does not even try to get to know her in  Randy responds saying that he really wants to but he feels like she hates him Their relationship deteriorates quite a bit once the family moves to Tegridy Farms as Shelly has a marijuana problem   He is Randys ancient father who is  years old He is suicidal though everyone merely laughs at his requests to be killed saying Thats our silly Grampa In  he was frustrated by the way Randy spoke to him as if he were speaking to his son rather than his father Stan then explained that that was partly why Grampa waged the war between the young and the elderly because he did not want to be treated like he was  In  it is revealed that Marvin brought Randy to the  when he was little In  Marvin claims to have never wanted children and that Randy was supposed to be nothing but the driedup crust on Gram Grams titties this possible resentment may partly explain the strain on their relationship   FilethumbRandys mother  She is Randys mother She was once married to  However due to the fact that they do not live together and Marvin had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in  this would imply that she also left Marvin eventually She is currently suffering from an unknown illness in the hospital She frequents Facebook and often calls Randy to bully  into keeping up with her Facebook status as seen in    Jimbo is Randys brotherinlaw They appear to have a decent friendly relationship
