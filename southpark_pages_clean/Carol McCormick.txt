support and protection although she and her mother seem to have a good relationship In  Carol holds Karen in her arms while trying to stop a fight between Stuart and Kevin and Karen asks for her mother when she and her siblings are in  In  she holds Karen on her lap during the gentrification meeting and has her arm around her when theyre sitting on their couch She does care greatly for Karens wellbeing as shown in  when she is concerned about Karen bringing in a syringe from the homeless living outside their house    At the end of  after Kenny dies she gives birth to a baby who looks just like Kenny She mentions this being the fiftysecond occurrence of this happening This indicates that every time Kenny dies he is reborn and grows to be his age within a days time This is later
