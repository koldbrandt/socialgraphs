character and her promotion to a significant character in recent seasons heidi is always portrayed as a genial thoughtful cute and sweet girl since  she has been shown to be one of the nicest and most socially sensitive girls in  quitting social media after being horrendously bullied by a   in  it is shown that heidi cares a lot about her appearance and as a result it takes her longer than usual to get ready for special events according to cartman she has no time management skills whatsoever  a negative attribute to her personality is that she is very prideful this is the reason why she is

parents in  further in  she was shown yet again with a different set of parents and  her latest again different parents were shown at the end of  and in  all of these are likely continuity errors    after  sends  away during  heidi is  crying and screaming no  no over a dogs body that  to have been run over by a car it is likely that robby was her pet     their relationship goes all the way back to s  where her parents arrived to pick her up from cartmans church cartman convinced them to let her stay for selfish reasons so she can be saved here she was named marcy  they were paired together in  heidi was displeased when she was paired with him cartman however did show remorse for breaking the egg and asked  to let her pass and have him fail however this was done for a selfish reason as cartman figured an a and an f would average out to a c since that  heidi and cartman did not interact with each other until in  in that  cartman calls heidi clitty litter which may suggest that even heidi does not get along with him  however heidi and cartman developed a relationship starting in  where she goes on to show cartman a life outside of social media in  the two are confirmed to be a couple and in a  they surprised their classmates by kissing the couple worked together to help denmark get  up and running they even sing a song named  with each other when the children were making

her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back worried about him heidi accepts this and they get back together  the toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the    in the  cartman grows frustrated with heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together instead of telling her how he felt he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt hed feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her  reprimands cartman for this saying that heidi is a nice girl and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly cartman dismisses this and later he convinces heidi to dress up as gretel while dressing himself up as hansel immediately after he takes heidi into the woods with him at night and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die and gets her kidnapped by a witch  it was revealed in the   that heidi tolerates cartmans abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend these feelings are directly influenced by the other girls who laugh at her and tease her for ever dating him albeit playfully they also expressed concern for heidis sanity and her safety while in her relationship with cartman all holding a personal vendetta against him kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself the girls assume that kyle has feelings for heidi leading kyle to question his relationship with her and he soon develops an interest in her after breaking up with cartman the girls take heidi out for dinner at buca de faggoncini where they again chastise heidi repeatedly for dating cartman all except lola who notes that heidi already admitted she made a mistake it soon comes to light that heidi has become kyles girlfriend angering cartman cartman recognizes heidis confusion about what she wants and uses this to manipulate heidi into taking him back while making her unintentionally prejudiced against jews  in the   we see the result of the toxicity of cartman and heidis relationship heidi begins to inherit several of cartmans traits including his obesity accent and attitude but even lazier louder and more obnoxious than he is heidi had now become practically a female version of cartman turning into an emotionally damaged bully with really aggressive tendencies so much to the point that cartman himself is at times intimidated by her despite cartman being clearly unhappy with what he turned heidi into he was desperate to keep heidi all to himself no matter how demeaning and selfish heidi became since he will be lonely all over again without her cartman and heidi switched attitudes in their relationship and heidi grew irritated with cartman while cartman became more compassionate acting much nicer to her eventually cartman has enough of heidis antics and begs her to go back to being the sweet girl she once was only for heidi to refuse  in  eric and heidi enjoy being awful together getting into a fistfight and watching the

battles with her inner conscience over her relationship with eric while walking with the boys through the forest they pass landmarks from the previous season including the bridge heidi threw her phone into when she quit social media she recounts and reassesses the events that lead her to meet eric cartman and what made her fall for him  she later recognized the place where she was kidnapped by the witch from halloween and cartman had her dress up as gretel realizing cartman tried to have her killed she then held cartman at gunpoint blaming him for the person she became but soon realized she has been engaging in selfvictimization ever since she has been seeing cartman  she decides to abandon the victim mentality and break up with cartman cartman tries to get heidi to take him back by threatening suicide but the attempt failed as heidi is now fully aware of cartmans manipulative nature and simply leaves him  the two have not had any onscreen interactions since then but it can be assumed that they are currently on bad terms since their final breakup heidi is shown sitting far from cartman in her two appearances in  implying that she is intentionally trying to avoid him in

manipulative influence on her   in  heidi returns to her old self and sits behind kyle in the music room with the two showing no hostility implying that they are now on amicable terms however it is unclear if they still have feelings for each other or not as they have not interacted with each other since then      bebe  to be very close to heidi possibly best friends they usually are  talking
