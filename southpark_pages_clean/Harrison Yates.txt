his investigation but when Jefferson decides to give away all of his money Yates lets him go having no need to put another poor black man in jail  In  when a serial killer strikes South Park Yates is desperate for answers and begins turning to psychics He becomes convinced that Cartman has psychic powers that can capture the killer and dismisses proven science such as fingerprinting and blood

him despite an overabundance of evidence He does ultimately put this aside and use good old fashioned police work to help apprehend the   In   reports to Yates and the cops that the Kindergarten

Michael Jackson who in South Park continuity was being framed for child molestation only to change his mind when Jackson decided to give all his money away making him another poor black man He also mentioned earlier in the episode how he aided in the framing of Kobe Bryant Hate Crimes In  since all of the people Yates framed were of AfricanAmerican descent and he arrested them out of spite for being richer than he is this is clearly a series of hate crimes in addition to framing the innocent Also in he and his fellow officers reveal that one of their main motives in joining the force was for the sole purpose of being able to beat up people of minority descent and expressing anguish that in societys eyes its wrong and he can longer abuse innocent people for no reason This heavily

than Officer Barbrady racist and misogynistic the last two of which he is perfectly willing to misuse the law to satisfy  Like most other South Park citizens however he does not notice these negative traits or rather believes they are good His microscopic intelligence is showcased when it took him presumably hours of extensive research to understand that a lefthand remains as such regardless of
