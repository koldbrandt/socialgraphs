then   a cleanshaven police officer with a similar design to yates  working under  in  as a background character  in  he  as a member of the  investigating illegal music downloads online helping   and  realize that their downloads are hurting musicians careers  in  he  at the  leading the investigation into s disappearance and is involving in pursuing  when his lies are uncovered  the character received his formal introduction in  where he is first depicted unambiguously as the lead detective in the  mentioning having served for twentyfive years with his name being used for the first time his partner mitch and his wife  also being introduced after  also known as mr jefferson moves into   he and the other detectives try to frame him as the file claims he is a wealthy black man he then panics and becomes disillusioned when he sees jefferson believing him to be white and is concerned he may have sent an innocent man to jail who was not black after a pep talk from his wife he resumes his investigation but when jefferson decides to give away all of his money yates lets him go having no need to put another poor black man in jail  in  when a serial killer strikes   yates is desperate for answers and begins turning to psychics he becomes convinced that cartman has psychic powers that can capture the killer and dismisses proven science such as fingerprinting and blood analysis as hocus pocus as a result he arrests and even kills a number of innocent people based on cartmans alleged psychic visions failing to identify the killer as such when he first investigates him despite an overabundance of evidence he does ultimately put this aside and use good old fashioned police work to help apprehend the   in   reports to yates and the cops that the kindergarten teacher  is in a relationship with his younger brother  it is shown that yates and his pals like all the other men in   do not see anything wrong with women committing sex crimes like this one at one point he remarked that he would have gladly hooked up with a sexedup teacher when he was a kid again proving to be more of a hindrance than anything else to the case  in  he went undercover as a prostitute after learning of an increase in   prostitutes though it was obvious when he was a man in drag he retained his male sexual organs his mustache and his hairy body no one seemed to notice this or at least chose to ignore it he also is unaware of the fact he doesnt need to have sex with the johns to arrest them for soliciting prostitution something that creeps out the rest of his squad he seems to take his role so seriously that he not only has sex with his johns he also is involved in a bareback gangbang with dozens of alpha tau omega fraternity men at the college and he also falls in love with his pimp runs off to  is married for a year before at last arresting him  in  yates is the primary police officer approached by  in the guise of the coon while he seems to see the coon as an annoyance and tells him to leave yates praises the assistance and work of the towns other hero  despite neither hero doing much to assist the police force themselves and the lack of response by them to either hero   marijuana paraphernalia in  he is  smoking cannabis though usage of marijuana is legal in the state of colorado police officers are prohibited from the usage of this drug framing innocent people in  he has mentioned how he and his fellow officers have been framing rich africanamericans for crimes they didnt commit he even reveals that he has knowledge of how the police framed oj simpson and expressed disappointment that the case fell apart because one man said the nword in court he was about to use false evidence from another police department to arrest michael jackson who in   continuity was being framed for child molestation only to change his mind when jackson decided to give all his money away making him another poor black man he also mentioned earlier in the  how he aided in the framing of kobe bryant hate crimes in  since all of the people yates framed were of africanamerican descent and he arrested them out of spite for being richer than he is this is clearly a series of hate crimes in addition to framing the innocent also in he and his fellow officers reveal that one of their main motives in joining the force was for the sole purpose of being able to beat up people of minority descent and expressing anguish that in societys eyes its wrong and he can longer abuse innocent people for no reason this heavily implies a lengthy history of abuse towards minorities and heavy corruption in yates department the town later sanctions this abuse in order to get rid of many homeless people and drug addicts migrating from the abandoned  into the more prominent parts of town allowing them to abuse the vagrants that are of minority descent satisfying their racist desires in  during the fight between cartman and kyle he shoots  alongside with his partner police brutality in  following the town sanctioning their persecution of minorities when they happen to be part of the homeless and drugusing vagrants camping out in various parts of town allowing yates and his colleagues to maliciously beat said vagrants ignoringundermining serious crimes in  when harrison learns from kyle broflovski under the alias brad that a teacher is having sexual relations with a student the former being kindergarten teacher ms stevenson and the latter being kyles toddler brother ike harrison is initially greatly alarmed and determined to arrest the pedophile but upon learning that the teacher is in fact an attractive young woman he sees no issue with this and doesnt even view this as child molestation only feeling jealous that a toddler is having sex with her and not him later however he does arrest and charge her but he actually apologizes to her saying the lady principal insisted with this and his evident bias shown above it is proven that he is misogynistic   yates has orange hair an orange mustache and thick orange eyebrows he wears a white buttonup shirt black tie black suspenders gold watch a belt with a gold buckle and in a brown leather holster his stainless smith and wesson series pistol with wood grips as does his partner mitch murphy indicating this is most likely the standard issue duty sidearm for   pd as a prostitute he wore a short red skirt a red bra and a blonde wig   yates  to be rather gullible and believes in the supernatural and often wastes time by conducting extremely trivial investigations he seems to enjoy letting other people solve crimes for him be they supposed psychic mediums the   or  kenny he is also stupid possibly slightly more so than officer barbrady racist and misogynistic the last two of which he is perfectly willing to misuse the law to satisfy  like most other   citizens however he does not notice these negative traits or rather believes they are good his microscopic intelligence is showcased when it took him presumably hours of extensive research to understand that a lefthand remains as such regardless of the angle of which its   there is a great possibility that he is a closet homosexual or at least bisexual as depicted in  where he takes his prostitute role way too seriously and marries his pimp in order to arrest him in  he suggests he might even kiss a dude while hula dancing    he is married to  who shares his views on rich black men as she supported him in  she is very supportive and encouraging towards him throughout her appearances in later s

justice both of which are about arresting black people for apparently no reason after completion he becomes the new kids coonstagram follower  his prominent role in this game takes place during the thin white line mission as the new kid fights further into  he consistently tries to explain that he is not a racist after all the horrible truth turns out to be that yates and his fellow cops are outergod worshipers he engages himself in the bossfight against shubniggurath and is beatable  yates also  in danger deck as an enemy     shows stan kyle and kenny what happens to famous people who
