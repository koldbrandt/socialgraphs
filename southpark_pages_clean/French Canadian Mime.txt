 the french canadian mime is a mime who  in      as  and  were on their way to  to see the prime minister they ended up in french canada and met the mime the mime tells the group that the prime minister had recently passed a law that banned the consumption of wine and wanted to follow them  the group managed to overturn the laws when it was discovered that  had been in control all along   the mime wears a typical mime costume unlike most canadians the mime has a squareshaped head instead of a round one   it is noted by rick the mountie that the mime like all other french canadians are a little odd in the first conversations the mime would show a hand sign imitating calling the other party through a phone and expects them to reciprocate  the mime rarely uses body movements and instead speaks often which is atypical of a mime artist
