  Butters alter ego is  a supervillainmad scientist he became when the boys dumped him He spreads chaos with his sidekick  and his hamsters or minions In  the police and citizens watching his fight against Mysterion seemed aware of his name The police decided not to even try to shoot him believing as a villain he had unknown superhuman abilities and the bullets would not affect him and believed he could not die  In  it was revealed that Professor Chaos uses General Disarrays grandmothers  as his base of operations There are cardboard computers and a board of possible suspects for  and Mysterion  In  it is revealed he was captured by  and has been held captive in Cartmans basement for several days without food or water He is still there in  and later is joined by the Coon  In  as he is burning all of his alterego costumes he attempts to burn his Professor Chaos mask as well but is abruptly interrupted by  As a result his costume remains unharmed  In  after a moment of hesitation Butters decides to confront his  with his Professor Chaos identity His plan backfires as his grandmother who has also adopted a supervillain alter ego easily overpowers him  In the  episode  Professor Chaos creates fake news about the Coon and Friends group by making fake posts about them on Facebook ruining their reputation and keeping Netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise He later hires an army of children to aid him and work as his minions the  The Chaos Kids help Butters create even more fake Facebook posts using an abandoned warehouse as their secret lair  Chaos  Early in his career as  Butters was successful at bringing chaos to his fourth grade classroom when he stole the erasers from the chalkboard During the process of changing into his Professor Chaos costume Butters was discovered by  who chose to join him as his sidekick  after being eliminated in the boys quest to find a new fourth member Together Professor Chaos and General Disarray hatched out evil plots that included trying to flood the world with his garden hose and destroying the ozone layer with aerosol spray  Plans In  Butters devises a series of supposedly original evil plots only to abandon each of them after General Disarray informs him that they have already been used on  He nearly goes insane after a while of this but gets consoled later by the reassurance that this is only because the show has run so long not his own lack of creativity This itself was inspired by the reallife frustration that creators  and  coming up with ideas and plots only to find out the that The Simpsons had already beaten them to the punch Parker and Stone themselves literally went through every episode to find something that had never been done And eventually they did boy bands They conceived an episode only to find out the Simpsons did and released such an episode right before theirs was set to air    and  Butters is an only child His parents  Chris in some appearances and  are very authoritarian strict and at some points abusive towards their son  often severely scolding him for circumstances that are entirely beyond his control This has evidently affected Butters psychologically he often tells himself off in the absence of his parents It is also hinted that the justification for this abuse lacks rationality As additional evidence of psychological problems he has stated in  that he wakes up to the sound of his own screams However it is clear that Linda cares deeply for him she becomes hysterical when he faked his death in  and becomes extremely distressed when he is missing in  and  Also before his father ever appeared in the show an adult man who is very similar to Butters was seen as a background in early seasons  He is intimidated of his dominating father who he is obliged to respectfully refer to as Sir His father uses fear as his primary parenting tactic with Butters once intentionally frightening him with threats of SuperAIDS It is shown on a number occasions that he really does care about Butters but he believes his methods are the best way in which to raise him Linda however has been shown to be much more tender to her son hugging and kissing him often She seems to go along with Stephens harshness only because she believes that its the best of her son  It was revealed in  that his family includes an aunt and uncle who live in Los Angeles Butters claims in  that his  molested him There was a mention of a grandmother in  who had a stroke shortly after she saw Butters on television with testicles on his chin and then his parents went to visit her in the hospital Ten seasons later Butters mentions his grandma again in  stating she is from Virginia In   gets a prominent role constantly bullying her grandson which makes her another member of the Stotch family that abuses Butters It is unknown if that grandma was his maternal or paternal grandmother or the same one that is mentioned in the episodes before that Also while Butters and all members of his family shown appear to be entirely Caucasian Cartmans repeated insult to Butters is Butters you black asshole Instead of suggesting that Butters has some African or AfroAmerican descent it is more likely that this is simply a childish insult out of Cartmans stupidity ironic due to Butters showing no stereotypical AfricanAmerican traits and often exhibiting stereotypical CaucasianAmerican traits  Abuse and Neglect  Stephen and Linda are very strict with Butters and have both abused and neglected him in one way or another or after his friends get him in serious trouble He is usually grounded after he gets involved with something because they usually conclude that it was either Butters all on his own or that he at least played a major role and do not believe that he is being bullied They have also threatened to ground Butters for things he cannot control such as in  Stephen orders him to stop having nightmares or he would be grounded Also in  Butters parents ground him for making a silly face in his school photo believe he is wearing makeup at one point he is not at all in and are convinced that his normal face is silly and has made himself look like a girl It is assumed that Linda and Stephen actually have some sort of compulsive need to punish Butters as demonstrated in  during which they threaten to ground him for minor mistakes such as misplacing the chocolate Quick mix When Butters under the belief that he is a vampire refuses to listen to their threats they become unnerved and afraid that they will never be able to ground Butters again After Butters returns to his normal behavior his parents become immensely relieved that they again have dominion over their son and immediately proceed to ground him again  In  it is shown that Butters parents were planning to ground him if the girls at school thought he was the ugliest in the class Stephen also physically beats Butters in   Cartman pretended to be Butters on the phone and insulted his parents really goading them Then he sat outside to hear Stephen and Linda tear through him Considering Stephen and Lindas possible problems controlling their anger it is likely that  was not the only time he was beaten  The most distinguishing abuse was in the season five episode  which centered on how Linda sent Butters to spy on his father to find out what he was getting Linda for their wedding anniversary and among other things Butters saw Stephen go into a mens bathhouse Butters did not understand what it was and told his mother who then in a spot of insanity attempted to kill Butters by pushing a car with Butters inside off a dock Linda then wrote a suicide note and was about to kill herself just when Stephen stepped in the resulting confrontation changed her mind about suicide Stephen and Linda tried to keep Butters murder a secret and blamed it on some Puerto Rican guy Butters meanwhile found a way home and his parents came clean When he found out that his mother had tried to kill him and his father was gay or rather bisexual he was horrified but tried to pass it off When asked if he was really going to be okay after discovering all that he admitted No Im lying  At the end of the sixth season in  Butters gets revenge on his parents for their abuse of him culminating in them hiring an actor to pretend to be Butters future self so as to scare him out of doing drugs by paying Cartman to smear feces all over his house The act ironically leads the  to realize how badly they have treated their son and they apologize an act that is contrasted by Stan Marshs parents refusing to apologize for them hiring an actor to be Stans future self to the extent that they mutilate their actor when Stan tricks them into thinking he chopped off his own hand Since then the Stotches have not been shown hurting their son physically and in  Stephen tells Butters that he loves him However he did believe that the world was soon going to end as  won the presidential election so one could think this was because Stephen was going hysterical or he wanted to make peace with his son  Despite all the abuse Butters has received his parents have been shown to really care deeply about their son this can be seen in  where they go as far as to even promise him not to ground him for more than a couple weeks if he does not kill himself As shown in  they sell a reluctant Butters to Paris Hilton for  million Butters realizes that many of Paris pets have killed themselves and gets away and  is swallowed anally by  As a result his parents ground him In  Butters briefly mentions that his  has committed sexual acts on him but has not realized that it is sexual molestation   In  after Butters returns home Cartman notes that he fed Butters cat The cat has since not been mentioned and has yet to make an appearance    FileButtersFacebookthumbrightButters profile picture on Facebook which can be found on his official  Facebook page It can also been seen in the background of  In  he was chosen by Stan Kyle and Cartman as their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died Later Kyle Stan and Cartman decided that they did not like Butters and chose  to fill the void instead However he seems to be friends with classmate  and second grader Dougie in earlier episodes as seen in  and  Butters is often referred to as a little pussy wuss lame gaywad and faggot by the boys The boys got him to take the fall for everything they did  often getting Butters grounded in the process Despite all these occurrences Butters still seems to consider the boys friends Butters is the friend  hang out with the most In  Butters mentioned he had a girlfriend named Carrie in Michigan Aside from this instance she is never mentioned again In  Butters developed a crush on  a waitress at the  However his strong feelings for her were onesided she had only been using him for his money as all Raisins employees do Lexus would eventually cause Butters to become depressed although he quickly got over it In  it was revealed that Cartman is the only person who still picks on him it is likely that the rest of the boys consider him a friend for example Kyle seems genuinely concerned about Butters pimping and personality change in    Butters has become Cartmans most frequent bullying victim Butters sees Cartman sometimes as a friend and treats him as so However Cartman takes advantage of this and finds Butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view or get him to do what he wants He is often extremely cruel to him and uses him as a scapegoat whenever he needs someone to blame He constantly makes fun of him for his effeminate tendencies and his naive innocent nature often calling him gay Butters does not even take a stand on Cartman and that somehow Butters is the only character who does not hate Cartman despite all the cruelty he receives from Cartman   In  Cartman easily gets Butters to vote for his idea of a turd sandwich simply by describing the candidates in a misleading way In  he gets Butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the Wii video game console Butters is in heart hurt by all of Cartmans bullying and when Cartman goes too far with it it gives Butters the opportunity to make Cartman pay for his bullying and cruelty However in  Butters helps Cartman apologize to everyone he offended and after this Cartman personally apologizes to Butters for all the things he did Butters wrong at and Butters seems to forgive Eric without hesitation  In many episodes entire plots are centered on Cartmans antics against Butters In  Cartman gets Butters grounded and makes several prank calls to Butterss parents Cartman then frames Butters for making the prank calls by imitating his voice which leads to both parents beating and abusing Butters   In  Cartman faked an apocalypse so Butters would hide in a bomb shelter for three days so Cartman could go with Kyle Stan and Kenny to  instead of Butters However the other boys found out about this and Cartman gets arrested for causing Butters disappearance and was sentenced to a week in juvenile hall In  Cartman dressed as a robot to trick Butters but in the end this failed miserably Butters happily got his revenge by publicly showing a tape of Cartman dressed like  trying to woo over a cardboard standee of    In  Butters also gets revenge at Cartman by farting on his face and giving him the finger for swearing Jesus name in front of everybody and ruining their band He also taunts Cartman for being the real ugliest kid in their class and mocks his neoNazism in a deleted scene in  In  Butters remarks Aw you lived when he sees Cartman In  most kids at  ignore Cartman because they feel he deserves it Unlike the other boys Butters is not aware of the plan and Cartman believes that Butters is the only one who can see him now that he is dead  In  he repeatedly invited Butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him including putting cat poop on his face and moon Butters It backfired when he made an inappropriate picture featuring him putting Butters penis in his mouth and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class In  after Cartman gets brutalized by Wendy Butters agreed with Craig that he always hated Cartman with everyone else which made it clear that Butters was finally standing up to Cartman even though we initially seemed to be on Cartmans side as he said I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her This has not seemed to stick as he goes right back to Cartmans side in  acting as Cartmans sidekick   In  Cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards Butters after he is queefed upon and even gives him a present He then participated in a statewide attempt to ban queefing with Butters as a mascot although he refuses to go near Butters after he was queefed on Cartman punishes Butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl during fourth grade in    In  Cartman posted wanted signs of Butters that authorized the US border patrol to shoot and kill Butters on sight When Cartman joined the border patrol he tried to murder Butters but failed It is revealed in  that Butters is sick and tired of putting up with Cartman getting the last words In  Butters joins Kyle Stan Token Craig Clyde and Jimmy to smash his electronics due to them thinking that he was    His friendship with Kyle is fairly decent Kyle treats Butters more kindly than the other boys as seen when he decided to take Butters along to Casa Bonita for his birthday In  Kyle attempted to tell Butters how Cartman was taking advantage of him whilst he slept over at his house However Kyle is not against using Butters as a guinea pig when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs Kyle occasionally makes fun of Butters swears at him or calls him names as well as using him as a scapegoat along with Stan Cartman and Kenny whenever he needs someone else to take blame He also agreed with Cartmans plan to kill Butters after Kenny threw shuriken stuck in his eye in  to avoid punishment Under the influence of hapahui apahoha in  Butters angrily tells Kyle You just think you know everything dont you Kyle Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like youre the frickin expert Butters has harassed Kyle as shown in  and bullies him for being Jewish usually because of Cartmans influence and manipulation Kyle generally sees Butters as a close friend and Butters sees him as a close friend too Kyle also defended Butters for not kissing a girl in    Butters took Kennys place after he died leading to more interaction between the two in later episodes Butters friendship to Kenny seems to be stronger than Cartman since Cartman usually makes fun of both Butters and Kenny In  Butters draws a picture of him and Kenny as best friends together in an airplane which Kyle delivers to Kenny at the hospital Kenny plays the good cop and comforts Butters in  and Butters tries to help Kenny with his catpee addiction during  The two are also playing together in a sandbox in  In  Kenny and Butters can be seen hugging when Stan and Kyle break  points on Guitar Hero Also in  Butters seems quite alarmed when he discovered Kenny has a whore girlfriend Butters is also often sharing things with Kenny like in  when he shares his cup to scoop up Kennys puke when he is dared to eat it In  he admits that Kenny is the only person in school that has a sense of dignity When the natives of Hawaii want to kill Kenny for being an outsider Butters stands in their way considering Kenny as his best friend At the end of the episode both of the boys get Hawaii rewards cards    and Butters are often seen together in many episodes most notably in  in which they are seen together throughout the whole episode When they were at Sunday School Token is seen next to Butters when he goes to tell  about Timmy When Kenny gets  they are next to each other crossing the street and when they sneak into the church they are seen together again In  they are seen on the same sled In the class room they sit next to each other They also both join Cartmans Band Faith in  In the beginning of The List when Butters tells the boys that the girls in their classroom have a list rating every boy from cutest to ugliest Token asks him which one of the boys is the ugliest to which Butters says he does not know yet saying that the girls woudl not let anyone else but themselves see the list Although Token and Butters are known to be on good terms with each other in the end of  they are seen fighting with each other blaming each other for the loss of stardom of the WTF while Cartman and Kyle fight each other for the same reason as well as Stan and Jimmy fighting each other for the same reason   Stans friendship with Butters is similar to that of Kyles he can be friendly to Butters hanging out with him in  when the two of them learned the truth behind Motivation Corp to using Butters as a scapegoat along with Cartman Kyle and Kenny or as a guinea pig for the boys antics such as in  In  Butters tells Stan that he is a kid who thinks that the entire planet revolves around him and only cares about his image Otherwise whenever Butters stands up to Stan he does so towards all the boys Youre all fake and stuck up The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny and the rest of you have your heads up your butts   Butters and Stan have also had more amicable moments In  Stan defended Butters speech No Butters that doesnt sound stupid at all and ditched the goth kids when he realized Butters is right I like life a lot more than hating it At the end of  Butters took Stans place in the game and told Cartman that he

said he was okay with it     Butters met Charlotte in  after being forced by the other boys to find a Canadian girl to have a Hot Cosby with to establish peace Though Butters was reluctant at first he and Charlotte developed feelings for each other and decided to take things slow Charlotte and her family returned to Canada at the end of the episode but she promised to Skype Butters when she got home   In  they are seen Skyping with each other They Skype again in  with Butters affectionately calling her baby and honey However in  Butters and Charlotte have ended their relationship with

the gas station together when the couple arrive Butters was the mechanic and Craig was playing spaceman In  they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight  However later in the series their friendship seems to have vanished in  Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tether ball while he is tied to the tether ball pole Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not Butters was present at dinner in  noting Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not which is ironic considering the fact Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character However a benevolent situation occurred in  where Butters was looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan Craig was getting along with Butters In  Butters shows he cares about Craig when Cartman posts videos of  on the internet   In  it is revealed that Butters birthday is September  a fact not disclosed until just over two and a half years

Butters is shown as lefthanded in  but in  and  as well as most of the recent episodes he is shown as righthanded This is either a continuity error or Butters is ambidextrous During some DVD commentaries Matt Stone and Trey Parker mention that Butters is one of their top  favorite characters In the South Park Season  intro until he was kicked out as the fourth friend Butters is seen holding a sign saying  over the South Park sign After being kicked out he is shown as Professor Chaos knocking the sign down before laughing inaudibly Butters has a phenomenal imagination and it was

he shares the earnings with the girls in the kissing company In  it is shown in a dream he has crushes on  and  Butters once had a girlfriend from Michigan named Carrie as shown in    Season
