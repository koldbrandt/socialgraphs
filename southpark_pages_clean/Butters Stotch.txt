 speaking     leopold butters stotch is a major character in the series  he is a fourthgrader in  butters role gradually began to increase after he replaced  during his temporary removal in  this allowed butters to gain more screen time and further develop his character he is the innocent child in the group and cartmans most exploited and possibly best friend butters is loosely based on  an animation directorproducer that works on the show   butters has made appearances since  though initially as a background character he gets his first speaking role in the    and he receives another speaking role in the following  he later receives a speaking role in   butters was  sporadically in seasons three through five going from a social pariah in  to meanspirited bully in   in  butters was adopted by stan marsh  and  as their fourth friend when kenny mccormick died permanently at the end of the  the writers had given butters his own spotlight  as the season five finale to prepare fans for butters taking kennys place on the show the  titled  gave butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and his mother attempted to drown her son butters in a fit of madness they all made up at the end of the  and nothing came of it  butters found himself as the new fourth friend being put down and treated like a total outcast by his new friends kyle stan and cartman all openly bullied butters telling him how he is not cool like kenny cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making butters suffer to the extent that in  he pretended to be butters on the phone and badmouthed his parents just so he could watch them abusing him several instances show the boys having butters dress up as kenny or simply call him kenny or notkenny possibly to cope with their loss  butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more s two of the s continued the plot of butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of  ending the  just as butters was about to be beaten with cartman being beaten up instead ultimately in the sixth  of season six  butters is expelled from the group for being too lame and adopts his supervillain alter ego  as a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him butters would run around for several s as professor chaos only to have no one care much about his plots since many of them had though butters did not realize it already occurred on s of the animated series  butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of professor chaos to stan although he mistook it for butters coming out of the closet  though not anymore a member of the main fours group butters was nevertheless kept as a prominent member of the boys extended circle though he has returned kennys role has declined to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and butters has taken on a more prominent role again despite their illtreatment toward him butters stays loyal to his friends perhaps in hopes that they will accept him in a way this has worked as recently there seems to have been some shift in the balance of friendship the most obvious case of this being in  where butters is calmly playing along with stan kyle and kenny with cartman being much more alienated than usual as well as in  where kyle decides to take butters with him on his birthday to casa bonita instead of cartman implying he likes butters more than cartman it has been said that kyle despises cartman because of his cruel sadistic and selfish attitudes as well as his prejudiceespecially towards the jews  despite their history butters has recently taken on the role as cartmans sidekick cartman often takes advantage of butters kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his schemes cartman hurts and betrays butters quite often however butters continues to trust him unconditionally despite this butters got even in  where he filmed cartman dancing dressed up as  later showing it to s various students and faculty  butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of  in  butters accidentally strays from cartmans house and almost gets run over by a car he is then refuged in a house by a couple who thinks that butters is a mexican and is given the name mantequilla which is spanish for butter they make him into their personal slave and then dump him into an el pollo loco restaurant butters then goes with some mexicans and crosses into mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the mexicans butters realizes his popularity in mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of mexicans he realizes that every time he raises his arms the mexicans cheer with joy butters is then made a fugitive by cartman but the  lets butters back in and win the game of  he is allowed back into the  and shows his popularity to the other boys in addition he did not get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more than  weeks   butters was initially referred to in scripts and storyboards as puff puff and swanson   refers to him by the latter name in the opening scene of the season two   butters was renamed and properly introduced in the    alongside  his nickname is based on that of   animation director s    has voiced the character ever since his speaking debut in  when butters spoke in the early s however his voice was dramatically different from the stuttering ern accent he has now his voice then changed to how it sounds today in the season three     despite being sweet and nave butters does have a criminal record most of his crimes and misdeeds were however due to cartmans manipulation and therefore most of these crimes should be branded as unintentional or crime due to manipulation for the other crimes that were not under cartmans manipulation it is caused by butters naivety however as his alterego professor chaos he will attempt to commit crimes however his antics are not taken seriously and his plans usually fail miserably the crimes butters committed are included but not limited to  fraud in  he took credit for  in reality  wrote it this may not be entirely butters fault though as  originally told him he wrote the book he may have believed they were trying to mooch off of his success when they revealed that they had actually written the book pimping butters paid a stripper in  and started a kissing company in  which later had real prostitutes involved however these crimes were committed on plain stupidity and were unintentional it is normal for people to pay strippers and that the purpose for the kissing company butters made was to have women get paid for kissing men which is a kids game and is not branded on butters terrorism as professor chaos he along with  dougie and  cartman threatened to blow up a hospital if  did not unmask himself albeit it was due to cartmans manipulation he joins the anti group with cartman and holds up a restaurant which results in him shooting three people in the crotch by accident blackmail in  butters tells his  cartman that he caught cartman dressing up as britney spears and then dances with a  cardboard standee and videotaped it he told cartman that if he bullied pranked double crossed or got butters grounded once more then butters would show the videotape to all of  the motive butters had for blackmailing cartman was that butters wanted revenge on cartman for everything he did to butters in the past car theft in  he helps cartman steal a  and crash it injuring cartman and killing  others however this crime was committed on cartmans manipulation breaking and entering he breaks into cartmans house to try and bite him when he thinks he is a vampire he breaks into s ranch with stan kyle and cartman to get the baby cows manslaughter he helps cartman freeze himself in  which kills cartman however cartman comes back in the future and goes back in time so to butters it technically never happens so it is not a crime he accidentally kills a bunch of people on two separate occasions while tapdancing due to his shoe flying off and causes a chain reaction of events which kill people and lead people to kill themselves but the second time he does it everyone cheers and congratulates him as a result of this this crime is not branded on butters and his criminal record in  he writes a book called  which inspires someone to kill the  with a shotgun murder in  he and kyle are ordered by  to shoot at a  who unbeknown to them is a soldier dressed up in an alien costume however this does not really count as a crime as they were forced by the authorities to kill the soldier and were tricked into thinking he was an alien piracy he joins cartmans somalian pirate crew along with   and  in  in which they steal a lot of money and weapons however the united states government ignores this crime and blames the somalian pirates completely war crimes in  he joins cartmans army of drunken erners as a messenger although he did not ransack rape murder or loot attempted armageddon in  butters hosted a video and informed the citizens of   that he is going to flood the entire world with a garden hose however he only succeeded by flooding his backyard this was easily foiled and stopped by the water department assault with a deadly weapon shoots a patron of  and a police officer in the crotch while holding the patrons hostage with cartman in  they did not get in trouble and walked away after the police were too happy that  and  were convicted of the rape of indiana jones sexual assault in  he poked at s vagina while she was passed out drunk he did seem to know what he was doing was wrong as evidenced by his shocked face when his parents walked in however he did not seem to realize what he was doing was sexual or illegal indecent exposure in  butters ran around the school and into the kindergarten while naked in  he exposes himself at a girls volleyball game and then leading the  marching through the halls while exposing himself false advertising in  butters distributes his new energy drink during the  craze known as  which turned out to be his semen this sports drink then gets distributed to a wider audience which could cause some serious health problems for some people however butters honestly did not know that he was distributing his own semen arson although not  butters burns down the school gym in  and as a result gets suspended for it civil unrestrioting was  rioting at the nebraska mall after finding out the mr hankey was a fake in  participant in   elementary gender war during  sedition in the  he was a member of  a group with the goal of stopping the execution of  by the government though he did it to save the world from  and  so that can be justified voter fraud in  butters is shown to have some involvement in cartmans conspiracy after being cornered by kyle stan kenny craig token jimmy and timmy he swallows a single almond mm to prevent him from talking he is later  in the emergency room with his face and cheeks swollen he does eventually give the information after kyle threatens to get his father involved it is later revealed that cartman realized butters broke his promise of secrecy so he visits him in the hospital he informs butters that the ballots are safe before feeding him another mm worsening his condition   butters has not shown signs of being very prone to illness unlike kyle for example but he does have a history of occasional healthrelated problems on the show  in  he said that he had a condition that made it hard to control his sphincter and because of this he sometimes defecates in his pants and has to wear a diaper to school logically this would be considered butters biggest health problem but it has never been even remotely mentioned anywhere else in the show except for one scene later on in the same  he has also said that he kept his sphincter problem and the fact that he wears diapers to school a secret from everyone except his parents his doctors and cartman who he told without knowing it was him  in  butters is singing his  at the  but when he forgets the words he becomes very nervous and wets himself before running offstage his accident is very obvious and visible when it happens of course this would probably mean that his sphincter problem has been cured and he is wearing normal underwear it is most likely however that the writers on the show either forgot about it or decided to ignore it outside of the one  where it was mentioned  in  butters is shown to be severely allergic to almonds after being cornered by stan and kyle butters ingests a single almond mm to prevent him from having to disseminate any information he is later  in the hospital swollen and unable to articulate speech   in  stan kyle cartman and kenny bought authentic japanese weapons from a fair butters wants to play with them but they do not allow him butters then transforms into professor chaos and has a ninja fight with the gang this ends when kenny accidentally throws a shuriken into butters eye which causes him extreme pain shocking the other boys luckily butters receives medical attention after the whole town sees him in shock in later s his eye  to be fine as if it never happened  in  he finds out that a bully from preschool got out of jail and then tries to hide his dad later kicks him out of the house in an effort to make him have fun but he simply gets nervous and starts singing to himself the bully arrives and gives him several stereotypical bully injuries including a wedgie so massive it almost killed him and two severe indian sunburns  in  he hits  between her legs in order to obtain the list she keeps away from the boys he apparently gets beaten up for it afterwards as in the next scene he is  with a black eye and an arm in a sling  in  he is punched in the face during his fight with  as the coon intervenes he leaves the frame with a bloodied nose also claiming a broken tooth  in  he shows up in the cafeteria at lunchtime sporting a black eye the kids think a school bully is responsible and suggest that he talk to his grandmother about it however it is revealed that she is the one who has been inflicting this pain on him  in  he is forced to delete any bad comments about people that are posted on social media or get two weeks of detention butters eventually goes insane from sleep deprivation and being tormented by  and jumps out of the school window causing him to have a head brace for the rest of  these injuries appear to be gone by    intelligence and memory butters openly joins and helps with some of cartmans schemes and is usually shown doing well at it butters is often depicted as being innocent gullible easily manipulated and stupid  butters is shown to be smart in  and highly talented instantly supplying the correct answer to a complicated math problem as well as playing the drums the context suggests this is a talent of butters that is well known to the others he also tutors stan at his request in   although it is not clear in which subject possibly more than one  however in  he did not realize that cartman may die if frozen in snow for several weeks  he had to get dougie to inform him of these facts although this may reflect his innocence butters may have thought that a person can survive being frozen due to  real name larry from  being frozen in ice for thirtytwo months and being revived completely healthy this would give him good reason to believe that cartman could survive being frozen for three weeks in  butters was able to hack into the jumbotron in coors field which shows he is proficient in it in  butters was shown with good negotiation skills  dance as revealed in  butters is a very talented tap dancer but his fondness for dancing was cut short at the national tap dancing championship when a freak accident caused by butters tap shoe flying off his foot set off a chain reaction leading to the deaths of eleven people this has left butters quite scarred although this is not immediately apparent in the same  he was further terrified as his tap shoe again started another fatal chain of events leading to the death of  and their  who butters and stan were set to face in a dance contest  he also seems to have some breakdancing ability as  in  additionally butters exhibits some impressive freestyle dancing ability dancing to s  in  he showed off more dance moves at the end of  during satans party imitating   singing and music butters is often  singing to himself usually  a song that goes lu lu lu ive got some apples  lu lu lu youve got some too he is often cut off at that point when he does finish the ending is lu lu lu lets make some applesauce  take off our clothes and lu lu lu or lu lu lu lets get together  i know what we can do lu lu which either way could be a strange euphemism for sexual intercourse in  butters sings lu lu lu ive got some splish splash lu lu lu splish splashing more making it seem that his song has changed but this may be only because he was taking a bath while singing it in  butters is in the outfield in baseball and is  singing a song that goes i see a ladybug hello little ladybug he may have been watching a ladybug in the grass while singing in  butters auditions for  by singing  in  he sings  about his robot friend that resembles the theme song of the courtship of eddies father and he seems fond of the chicago ballad  apparently butters can also play the drums quite proficiently he is  doing so for cartmans christian rock band  featured in   in  in the flashback of the horrible accident butters caused during the championship competition the song butters dances to is an upbeat yet obviously risqu song entitled  which features the lyrics wont you reach into my pocket and see what it is  then grab onto it just for you  give it a little squeeze and say how do you do  more recently in  butters is heard singing a song while using the urinal in the boys bathroom hey there mr weiner whaddaya know  do you need to tinkle tinkle  yes i do think so  in  butters preforms  by maxwell the end result is him being called a homo in  butters sings joni mitchells song  while playing with his army figurines we hear butters singing from a tape recorder happy trails to you in character as a big texas singer in  butters frequently sings the line from chicagos  in   in  it is shown he can beatbox quite well  in  butters can be  listening to a song from the ring jonas brothers on mtv  in  butters is a guitarist for stans band  with the other members being stan as the lead singer kenny as bassist and jimmy as drummer  art  butters is extremely adept in art and the show often makes examples of his abilities in  butters makes construction paper versions of the four boys for their animated christmas short this may be a reference to  s director of animation  whom butters is loosely based on butters also shows his artistic talents in  when he draws a picture of himself and his robot friend in  he sends a letter to kenny in the hospital which contains a drawing of them both in an airplane with the words me and my friend kenny written above as well in  where the four boys get into trouble by their teacher stan claims that art class is for gaywads butters then prominently states that he loves art class briefly in  kyle interrupts butters tagging a building with his name in the style of a well practiced graffiti artist which is strange because he could be charged with vandalism butters is always  worrying about following rules in casa bonita butters shows the garbage dump worker a very accurate statue he made of cartman out of garbage in  butters is shown using a sewing machine quite handily to make his cape for his alter ego sports he played with the rest of the boys as the left fielder on their baseball team in  he was number  on the dodgeball team in  he is also  playing football with the others in  he has been shown several times to be somewhat weak physically especially in fights this might impact whatever sport skills he has writing in   shift the blame of writing a  on butters in the hopes to avoid punishment for creating something so disgusting however when the book becomes a success butters takes credit believing he did create it after having assorted blackouts after reading  and goes on to write a second book entitled  butters style however is much more childish than that of the boys the extent of his vulgar language involves repeated use of the words peepee and poop however due to people constantly overanalyzing things for what was not really there the book becomes an instant success at least until the book supposedly causes a man to kill the  butters is actually a poor writer or at least a lot worse than stan kyle cartman and kenny languages aside from speaking english butters is shown to understand at least one other language in  when cartman asks residents of  the location of the pirates he asks butters to ask them something using a book to see how he would say the question in somalian when someone replies butters while taking a quick glance at the book can understand what the man is saying weaponry in  butters was shown wielding an semiautomatic handgun glock given to him by cartman due to the fact butters was still a kid his hands flailed wildly and he was only able to shoot guys in their penis   butters has a small tuft of bright blond hair on the top of his head he wears a turquoise jacket and dark green pants for the rest of season  butters wore a neck brace after trying to commit suicide in      fileinnocentthumbbutters in  butters has a warm personality that everyone finds comforting fans consider him one of the sweetest most innocent and most gullible characters on the show he is unique because he has the personality of a child in contrast to the other more cynical adultlike kids he is generally much nicer and much more naive than the four main characters although he and  are shown bullying  a homeschooled boy in  while it is worth noting that it was before the major character development of butters in the show the kids are often annoyed with butters because he is not cruel cold gross confident enough like a normal little boy as well as the fact that he is a pussy he is also vulnerable to being taken advantage of and the boys often use him for selfdefense when they are in very sticky situations such as in  when they make butters go get raped by the  members to save them however butters is saved from getting raped when  is confused by the pedophiles as one of the young boys  unlike nearly all  characters he rarely curses and instead uses euphemisms such as aw hamburgers or son of a biscuit he has cursed a few times however with each instance meant to be very shocking in  for example butters solemnly says fuck you eric to cartman and farts on his face after his mental breakdown in  butters says id rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid much to stans surprise and at least we have assholes to  he is also noted for swearing a lot more heavily in  he has also said youre poor as shit and thats fuckin gay which he said quite a lot during  in the earlier seasons butters seemed much more intelligent and he also seemed to use inappropriate words more often even saying when the girls challenged them to a sledding race us men will show those skanky hos who is who  butters refines himself in selfimprovement in almost everything to perfection studying regularly and often commenting on how he needs to learn to behave himself other skills include tap dancing but he vowed to not do that talent anymore because he accidentally caused a very horrible tragedy in the tap dancing championships unfortunately he also has extremely low selfesteem and therefore has no judgment as to when or how to use his skills and perceives everyone around him as knowing much more than he does another side effect of this is that he is almost constantly worried about being grounded butters is a good student and considered to be a dork by his associates butters seems to be constantly seeking a role model as evidenced when he takes to cartman unbeknownst to him pretending to be a robot in  he constantly struggles to find acceptance among his associates hence why he often does menial tasks in hopes that this will earn him favor and respect in the same  he reveals to cartman dressed as awesomo all of his darkest secrets including the fact that he suffers from a herniated colon which means he cannot always control his bowels and requires him to take a suppository through his anus regularly in  it is revealed that butters enjoys going to  and he always hangs out there in  butters is mistakenly accused of being bicurious and although he agrees it is obvious he does not know what this means butters also unwittingly gave a very thoughtful speech in the same  regarding the treatment of bisexual children he also admits to be bikecurious in   in  butters is shown to be more assertive and less willing to go along with cartmans plans and rulebreaking in  he took the fact that he kissed  as a sign that he was now a man and began thinking on how he needs a job to pay for bills even though he is only a fourthgrader in  he is shown to be somewhat wise in the end when he basically tells stan you cant be upset forever butters biggest problem seems to be selfconfidence the will to stand up for himself he gets taken advantage of by nearly everyone he comes across in  once he believes he has actually become a vampire he is not so easily pushed around anymore as he thinks he is immortal in  butters finally stands up for himself by stating to the camp counselors that his confusion is nothing more than a result of the counselors telling several boys that are assumed to be bicurious that they are confused without explanation butters also showed some selfconfidence in  where he told the  that he would not be tricked and told them off by saying that they can suck on his wiener this outburst stunned the boys leaving cartman to ironically call butters an inconsiderate jerk sometimes when butters is very happy his smile  to have risen almost far up to his eyes while the bottom part of his face is almost all skin and nothing more as  in      and  mostly although he is ten years old butters still pees like a preschool boy by pulling his pants right down and pulling his shirt up as he stands in front of the urinal in  it  that butters may have an attraction to fat women as he fell for one of the kardashians because she was so big and squishy in  he is mistakenly diagnosed with multiple personality disorder as he impersonates various characters while playing like many normal kids do  however his kind sweet and gullible personality dis in  and is replaced with an upset pissy antisocial and rude persona as he beats up scott malkinson for having such a low self esteem due to the fact he has diabetes and when his boy classmates attempt to reason with him butters immediately lashes out at kyle saying he believes he knows everything and acts as though he is an expert at everything even though he is not and then rips on stan who he says believes the world revolves around himself and how stan only cares about self image  butters continues to insult his classmates saying that they are all just as bad selfish pieces of crap like cartman as well as being stuck up claiming that the only one with any decency is kenny  this personality fades away however when he has a ceremony at his home land hawaii and then returns to his kind and innocent personality  filebuttersthumbleftbutters presumably subconscious view of  butters shows obvious signs of mental trauma most likely due to s psychologically and physically abusive parenting as revealed in  this trauma extends to such an extent that he falls asleep and wakes up to the sound of his own screams further evidence of psychological trauma due to his father can be  in  where he was told to imagine the most prominent thing in his mind which happened to be his father screaming that he was grounded the imaginary version of his father later morphed into a monsterlike being  however his father is likely not his only source of psychological trauma butters social isolation and constant ridicule at the hands of some of his  likely traumatizes him as well furthermore in  butters was revealed to have been molested by his  although he did not seem to realize it was molestation this is likely another source of trauma as a result of these events butters has very low selfesteem constantly putting himself down as well believing he is a bad child who deserves punishment butters also has a nervous stutter  it is likely this can be attributed to psychological trauma though possibly  was the source of psychological trauma as she was constantly hurting him physically and mentally    butters alter ego is  a supervillainmad scientist he became when the boys dumped him he spreads chaos with his sidekick  and his hamsters or minions in  the police and citizens watching his fight against mysterion seemed aware of his name the police decided not to even try to shoot him believing as a villain he had unknown superhuman abilities and the bullets would not affect him and believed he could not die  in  it was revealed that professor chaos uses general disarrays grandmothers  as his base of operations there are cardboard computers and a board of possible suspects for  and mysterion  in  it is revealed he was captured by  and has been held captive in cartmans basement for several days without food or water he is still there in  and later is joined by the coon  in  as he is burning all of his alterego costumes he attempts to burn his professor chaos mask as well but is abruptly interrupted by  as a result his costume remains unharmed  in  after a moment of hesitation butters decides to confront his  with his professor chaos identity his plan backfires as his grandmother who has also adopted a supervillain alter ego easily overpowers him  in the    professor chaos creates fake news about the coon and friends group by making fake posts about them on facebook ruining their reputation and keeping netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise he later hires an army of children to aid him and work as his minions the  the chaos kids help butters create even more fake facebook posts using an abandoned warehouse as their secret lair  chaos  early in his career as  butters was successful at bringing chaos to his fourth grade classroom when he stole the erasers from the chalkboard during the process of changing into his professor chaos costume butters was discovered by  who chose to join him as his sidekick  after being eliminated in the boys quest to find a new fourth member together professor chaos and general disarray hatched out evil plots that included trying to flood the world with his garden hose and destroying the ozone layer with aerosol spray  plans in  butters devises a series of supposedly original evil plots only to abandon each of them after general disarray informs him that they have already been used on  he nearly goes insane after a while of this but gets consoled later by the reassurance that this is only because the show has run so long not his own lack of creativity this itself was inspired by the reallife frustration that creators  and  coming up with ideas and plots only to find out the that the simpsons had already beaten them to the punch er and stone themselves literally went through every  to find something that had never been done and eventually they did boy bands they conceived an  only to find out the simpsons did and released such an  right before theirs was set to air    and  butters is an only child his parents  chris in some appearances and  are very authoritarian strict and at some points abusive towards their son  often severely scolding him for circumstances that are entirely beyond his control this has evidently affected butters psychologically he often tells himself off in the absence of his parents it is also hinted that the justification for this abuse lacks rationality as additional evidence of psychological problems he has stated in  that he wakes up to the sound of his own screams however it is clear that linda cares deeply for him she becomes hysterical when he faked his death in  and becomes extremely distressed when he is missing in  and  also before his father ever appeared in the show an adult man who is very similar to butters was  as a background in early seasons  he is intimidated of his dominating father who he is obliged to respectfully refer to as sir his father uses fear as his primary parenting tactic with butters once intentionally frightening him with threats of superaids it is shown on a number occasions that he really does care about butters but he believes his methods are the best way in which to raise him linda however has been shown to be much more tender to her son hugging and kissing him often she seems to go along with stephens harshness only because she believes that its the best of her son  it was revealed in  that his family includes an aunt and uncle who live in los angeles butters claims in  that his  molested him there was a mention of a grandmother in  who had a stroke shortly after she saw butters on television with testicles on his chin and then his parents went to visit her in the hospital ten seasons later butters mentions his grandma again in  stating she is from virginia in   gets a prominent role constantly bullying her grandson which makes her another member of the stotch family that abuses butters it is unknown if that grandma was his maternal or paternal grandmother or the same one that is mentioned in the s before that also while butters and all members of his family shown appear to be entirely caucasian cartmans repeated insult to butters is butters you black asshole instead of suggesting that butters has some african or afroamerican descent it is more likely that this is simply a childish insult out of cartmans stupidity ironic due to butters showing no stereotypical africanamerican traits and often exhibiting stereotypical caucasianamerican traits  abuse and neglect  stephen and linda are very strict with butters and have both abused and neglected him in one way or another or after his friends get him in serious trouble he is usually grounded after he gets involved with something because they usually conclude that it was either butters all on his own or that he at least played a major role and do not believe that he is being bullied they have also threatened to ground butters for things he cannot control such as in  stephen orders him to stop having nightmares or he would be grounded also in  butters parents ground him for making a silly face in his school photo believe he is wearing makeup at one point he is not at all in and are convinced that his normal face is silly and has made himself look like a girl it is assumed that linda and stephen actually have some sort of compulsive need to punish butters as demonstrated in  during which they threaten to ground him for minor mistakes such as misplacing the chocolate quick mix when butters under the belief that he is a vampire refuses to listen to their threats they become unnerved and afraid that they will never be able to ground butters again after butters returns to his normal behavior his parents become immensely relieved that they again have dominion over their son and immediately proceed to ground him again  in  it is shown that butters parents were planning to ground him if the girls at school thought he was the ugliest in the class stephen also physically beats butters in   cartman pretended to be butters on the phone and insulted his parents really goading them then he sat outside to hear stephen and linda tear through him considering stephen and lindas possible problems controlling their anger it is likely that  was not the only time he was beaten  the most distinguishing abuse was in the season five   which centered on how linda sent butters to spy on his father to find out what he was getting linda for their wedding anniversary and among other things butters saw stephen go into a mens bathhouse butters did not understand what it was and told his mother who then in a spot of insanity attempted to kill butters by pushing a car with butters inside off a dock linda then wrote a suicide note and was about to kill herself just when stephen stepped in the resulting confrontation changed her mind about suicide stephen and linda tried to keep butters murder a secret and blamed it on some puerto rican guy butters meanwhile found a way home and his parents came clean when he found out that his mother had tried to kill him and his father was gay or rather bisexual he was horrified but tried to pass it off when asked if he was really going to be okay after discovering all that he admitted no im lying  at the end of the sixth season in  butters gets revenge on his parents for their abuse of him culminating in them hiring an actor to pretend to be butters future self so as to scare him out of doing drugs by paying cartman to smear feces all over his house the act ironically leads the  to realize how badly they have treated their son and they apologize an act that is contrasted by stan marshs parents refusing to apologize for them hiring an actor to be stans future self to the extent that they mutilate their actor when stan tricks them into thinking he chopped off his own hand since then the stotches have not been shown hurting their son physically and in  stephen tells butters that he loves him however he did believe that the world was soon going to end as  won the presidential election so one could think this was because stephen was going hysterical or he wanted to make peace with his son  despite all the abuse butters has received his parents have been shown to really care deeply about their son this can be  in  where they go as far as to even promise him not to ground him for more than a couple weeks if he does not kill himself as shown in  they sell a reluctant butters to paris hilton for  million butters realizes that many of paris pets have killed themselves and gets away and  is swallowed anally by  as a result his parents

cat the cat has since not been mentioned and has yet to make an appearance    filebuttersfacebookthumbrightbutters profile picture on facebook which can be found on his official  facebook page it can also been  in the background of  in  he was chosen by stan kyle and cartman as their fourth friend when kenny mccormick died later kyle stan and cartman decided that they did not like butters and chose  to fill the void instead however he seems to be friends with classmate  and second grader dougie in earlier s as  in  and  butters is often referred to as a little pussy wuss lame gaywad and faggot by the boys the boys got him to take the fall for everything they did  often getting butters grounded in the process despite all these occurrences butters still seems to consider the boys friends butters is the friend  hang out with the most in  butters mentioned he had a girlfriend named carrie in michigan aside from this instance she is never mentioned again in  butters developed a crush on  a waitress at the  however his strong feelings for her were onesided she had only been using him for his money as all raisins employees do lexus would eventually cause butters to become depressed although he quickly got over it in  it was revealed that cartman is the only person who still picks on him it is likely that the rest of the boys consider him a friend for example kyle seems genuinely concerned about butters pimping and personality change in    butters has become cartmans most frequent bullying victim butters sees cartman sometimes as a friend and treats him as so however cartman takes advantage of this and finds butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view or get him to do what he wants he is often extremely cruel to him and uses him as a scapegoat whenever he needs someone to blame he constantly makes fun of him for his effeminate tendencies and his naive innocent nature often calling him gay butters does not even take a stand on cartman and that somehow butters is the only character who does not hate cartman despite all the cruelty he receives from cartman   in  cartman easily gets butters to vote for his idea of a turd sandwich simply by describing the candidates in a misleading way in  he gets butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the wii video game console butters is in heart hurt by all of cartmans bullying and when cartman goes too far with it it gives butters the opportunity to make cartman pay for his bullying and cruelty however in  butters helps cartman apologize to everyone he offended and after this cartman personally apologizes to butters for all the things he did butters wrong at and butters seems to forgive eric without hesitation  in many s entire plots are centered on cartmans antics against butters in  cartman gets butters grounded and makes several prank calls to butterss parents cartman then frames butters for making the prank calls by imitating his voice which leads to both parents beating and abusing butters   in  cartman faked an apocalypse so butters would hide in a bomb shelter for three days so cartman could go with kyle stan and kenny to  instead of butters however the other boys found out about this and cartman gets arrested for causing butters disappearance and was sentenced to a week in juvenile hall in  cartman dressed as a robot to trick butters but in the end this failed miserably butters happily got his revenge by publicly showing a tape of cartman dressed like  trying to woo over a cardboard standee of    in  butters also gets revenge at cartman by farting on his face and giving him the finger for swearing jesus name in front of everybody and ruining their band he also taunts cartman for being the real ugliest kid in their class and mocks his neonazism in a deleted scene in  in  butters remarks aw you lived when he sees cartman in  most kids at  ignore cartman because they feel he deserves it unlike the other boys butters is not aware of the plan and cartman believes that butters is the only one who can see him now that he is dead  in  he repeatedly invited butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him including putting cat poop on his face and moon butters it backfired when he made an inappropriate picture featuring him putting butters penis in his mouth and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class in  after cartman gets brutalized by wendy butters agreed with craig that he always hated cartman with everyone else which made it clear that butters was finally standing up to cartman even though we initially seemed to be on cartmans side as he said i wanna see eric kick the crap out of her this has not seemed to stick as he goes right back to cartmans side in  acting as cartmans sidekick   in  cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards butters after he is queefed upon and even gives him a present he then participated in a statewide attempt to ban queefing with butters as a mascot although he refuses to go near butters after he was queefed on cartman punishes butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl during fourth grade in    in  cartman posted wanted signs of butters that authorized the us border patrol to shoot and kill butters on sight when cartman joined the border patrol he tried to murder butters but failed it is revealed in  that butters is sick and tired of putting up with cartman getting the last words in  butters joins kyle stan token craig clyde and jimmy to smash his electronics due to them thinking that he was    his friendship with kyle is fairly decent kyle treats butters more kindly than the other boys as  when he decided to take butters along to casa bonita for his birthday in  kyle attempted to tell butters how cartman was taking advantage of him whilst he slept over at his house however kyle is not against using butters as a guinea pig when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs kyle occasionally makes fun of butters swears at him or calls him names as well as using him as a scapegoat along with stan cartman and kenny whenever he needs someone else to take blame he also agreed with cartmans plan to kill butters after kenny threw shuriken stuck in his eye in  to avoid punishment under the influence of hapahui apahoha in  butters angrily tells kyle you just think you know everything dont you kyle every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like youre the frickin expert butters has harassed kyle as shown in  and bullies him for being jewish usually because of cartmans influence and manipulation kyle generally sees butters as a close friend and butters sees him as a close friend too kyle also defended butters for not kissing a girl in    butters took kennys place after he died leading to more interaction between the two in later s butters friendship to kenny seems to be stronger than cartman since cartman usually makes fun of both butters and kenny in  butters draws a picture of him and kenny as best friends together in an airplane which kyle delivers to kenny at the hospital kenny plays the good cop and comforts butters in  and butters tries to help kenny with his catpee addiction during  the two are also playing together in a sandbox in  in  kenny and butters can be  hugging when stan and kyle break  points on guitar hero also in  butters seems quite alarmed when he discovered kenny has a whore girlfriend butters is also often sharing things with kenny like in  when he shares his cup to scoop up kennys puke when he is dared to eat it in  he admits that kenny is the only person in school that has a sense of dignity when the natives of hawaii want to kill kenny for being an outsider butters stands in their way considering kenny as his best friend at the end of the  both of the boys get hawaii rewards cards    and butters are often  together in many s most notably in  in which they are  together throughout the whole  when they were at sunday school token is  next to butters when he goes to tell  about timmy when kenny gets  they are next to each other crossing the street and when they sneak into the church they are  together again in  they are  on the same sled in the class room they sit next to each other they also both join cartmans band faith in  in the beginning of the list when butters tells the boys that the girls in their classroom have a list rating every boy from cutest to ugliest token asks him which one of the boys is the ugliest to which butters says he does not know yet saying that the girls woudl not let anyone else but themselves see the list although token and butters are known to be on good terms with each other in the end of  they are  fighting with each other blaming each other for the loss of stardom of the wtf while cartman and kyle fight each other for the same reason as well as stan and jimmy fighting each other for the same reason   stans friendship with butters is similar to that of kyles he can be friendly to butters hanging out with him in  when the two of them learned the truth behind motivation corp to using butters as a scapegoat along with cartman kyle and kenny or as a guinea pig for the boys antics such as in  in  butters tells stan that he is a kid who thinks that the entire planet revolves around him and only cares about his image otherwise whenever butters stands up to stan he does so towards all the boys youre all fake and stuck up the only kid here with any sense of dignity is kenny and the rest of you have your heads up your butts   butters and stan have also had more amicable moments in  stan defended butters speech no butters that doesnt sound stupid at all and ditched the goth kids when he realized butters is right i like life a lot more than hating it at the end of  butters took stans place in the game and told cartman that he wanted to be the betrayer when he reached a celebritylike status

playing spaceman in  they are again  together urging cartman to fight  however later in the series their friendship seems to have vanished in  craig is the second kid to hit butters in the head with the tether ball while he is tied to the tether ball pole craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not butters was present at dinner in  noting butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not which is ironic considering the fact craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character however a benevolent situation occurred in  where butters was looking at the eavesdropper tabloids with craig and stan craig was getting along with butters in  butters shows he cares about craig when cartman posts videos of  on the internet   in  it
