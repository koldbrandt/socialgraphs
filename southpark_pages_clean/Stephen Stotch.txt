plainly stated in  stotch also known as chris is  abusive father as well as s husband   filethumb stotchs first appearance in   in  stephen is revealed to be bicurious in that he likes women but he is  going to a gay mens bathhouse to perform homosexual activities after it nearly cost him his family and marriage he suppressed these urges however in  he reveals his sexuality to butters and does not mind if his son turns out the same way  at times stephen seems to be homophobic at the beginning of  when he walks in on butters with s penis in his mouth he fears his son is turning gay and sends him to a camp where they supposedly pray the gay away also in  it is revealed that he made a bet with his wife that their son would not turn out gay when butters tells them about his love interest  linda admits that stephen beat her  in  there is a small quest involving breaking into a safe in stephens room in the safe there is a picture of him on the couch naked on his hands and knees with a seemingly pleasured face implying that he was engaging in sexual activity with another man the picture was labeled wrestling if you take the picture back to him he gives you  dollars possibly as a

implying that she may still fearknow that he is still into men though she  to be nonchalant about it   when he was first given an indepth role in  stephen appeared to be a very loving almost a sitcomlike father making bad yet goodnatured jokes and being rather sweet to his wife and son however as the  progressed his bicurious lifestyle was revealed as was his desire to use extreme methods to coverup things that could negatively affect him in later s he is noted for the harsh way in which he treats his son butters as he often grounds him for little things or things that were not his fault or that he had no control over such as in  he has beaten him on a few occasions such as  and openly snapping at butters such as telling him to shut his mouth as  in   there is some debate over whether stephen really cares for his son since he will go to extreme methods to help him even trying to bring him back from the dead in  adding onto this he showed great conflict when going on strike as an amazon worker being torn by his integrity to his coworkers and providing for his family so butters could be in the bike parade and in the end he chose to swallow his pride and return to amazon headquarters showing that his love for his son prevailed over his pride at that moment he also shows concern when butters goes missing such as in  but there are other times he has shown to be very selfish considering his needs and ambitions above those of his son as demonstrated in  although the price was admittedly ridiculously high and he made this decision after great deliberation he has a very heavyhanded approach to discipline which has resulted in butters seeing him as a kind of monster as shown in  in  he was quick to convince his wife that it was neither of their faults that butters was badly beaten up by a bully on their doorstep even though it was him who refused to let a frantic butters back in the house additionally in  when stephen and linda discovered butters had inadvertently caused an asian turf war when wondering why butters always caused so much trouble he immediately ruled out the possibility of being bad parents claiming he and linda were awesome however a way to interpret his bad behavior towards his son is that he simply does not understand that his behavior and excessive grounding are wrong and despite all of the unnecessary and cruel groundings he gave butters he actually has the best interests of raising his son atheart but just cannot see how to properly do that  at times he does seem slightly more down to earth than the other adults in town as  in  most often than not he usually will overreact though like all the other adults he can also be noted for the strange manner in which he cries or weeps  he is also shown to be very cautious about personal and social hygiene since the covid pandemic started scolding butters for still wanting to go to the  during the pandemic and criticizing a group of people for not wearing protective masks properly mockingly calling them chin diapers as  in    he is the coach of the little league baseball team in  he is  working in a cubicle  in  he is shown as a movie theater projectionist though this occupation has not been looked into any further than this   in  he gets a new job at the    stephen normally drives an animated version of an orange lexus suv but in  and  it is shown that the family also owns a priuslike mpv in  he changed his car to a hybrid but then changed back to his normal vehicle at the end of the    assaultchild abuse in  he and his wife beat up butters for badmouthing them over the phone when it was really  who did it he also locks butters in the basement thinking he was a hellspawn in  human trafficking in  he is willing to sell butters as s pet for a large sum of money  lying to authoritiesfiling a false police report in  he and his wife lie to police and the press by saying that butters was kidnapped by a puerto rican man when in actuality his wife put him in her car which was streaming down bodies of water murder  in  stephen murders a curtain company employee with a shovel to feed butters when they believe that his resurrection made him a hellspawn   he wears a drab olivegreen shirt a distinctive white tie blue jeans brown belt and black sneakers he has brown hair in a style similar to a grownout crew cut he is also  smoking a pipe at times suggesting that he could be a regular smoker     stephens name suggests german andor scottish heritage    during  mission in  as the player approaches a drunk stephen he has flashbacks to his mother grounding him and pleads with his mother not ground him in a distressed tone based on this it can be inferred that stephen had a nearly identical relationship with his  as he has with his son and his overbearing demeanor is a result of his past however in  he seems composed when his mother visits   and is oblivious towards her abusive attitude towards butters either stephen and his mother improved their relationship or he is aware of her true colors and stays silent out of fear    is stephens quietand at times submissivewife they normally appear to be a sweet and loving couple who are often on the same wavelength regarding each other and their raising of their son butters however their marriage suffers a painful shock when linda discovers that stephen is having homosexual affairs this ends up driving her insane and she attempts to kill buttersand later herself while attempting to coverup her supposed murder of their son they create an elaborate lie regarding some puerto rican guy however the lie soon becomes too complicated and they fight constantly over how to keep the story straight until at last they confess the truth they seem to have recovered from that incident and have never discussed it again  linda constantly changes between calling him stephen and chris since he is called stephen more often than he is called chris it can be assumed that chris could be his middle name although he states that his middle name is willis in     is stephens son and only child stephen has been shown to sometimes care about butters but he often treats him very harshly though he claims that it is for butters own good however in  when butters pretends to kill himself stephen and linda take his death horribly and stephen even goes so far as to bury what he believes to be butters body in an indian burial ground in the hopes of reviving him eventually he comes to believe that doing so would create a monster and thus when butters arrives home he locks his son in the basement and feeds him dead bodies overall while there have been many times he has given his son unfair punishment it can be generally concluded that he does indeed love his son as he said so in tears in    he is a good friend of  and  and he is among the more prominent adults of the town he has accompanied randy and gerald on many expeditions such as when they try to save their kids in  even when his own son was not missing he and linda also invited the marshes broflovskis and cartmans to accompany them to aspen in    in      and  stephen was referred to as chris instead of stephen this was
