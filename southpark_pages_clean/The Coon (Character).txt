of coon and friends stripped of his power the coon is last  in the coon and friends holding cell with butters and nothing but the latters excrement to eat    the coons primary weapons are sharp metal claws attached to his fingers made to resemble a raccoons claws he uses them to scratch up a mans face in  the man comments afterward ow that really stings and to beat up mosquito and mintberry crunch they appeared to cause more serious injury as evidenced by the large amount of blood on mosquito he also uses his bare hands to hurt his enemies such as when he punches  in the face or when he kicks mosquito in the face and groin  he is shown using a variety of conventional equipment such as computers binoculars and tvs all of which have coonthemed names and labels on them in the coon he also

coon confronts the great old one  in the coons worst enemythe coon in the coon holding cell with  and his poop    like his alterego  the coon is deemed selfish egomaniacal with a short temper and wanted to be the only one with the spotlight demonstrated as he tried to get rid of  so he can be s only superhero he defines being a hero as making the world a better place for himself but in reality the coon is a villain  he has a massive problem with concealing his identity  as cartman he is always going out of his way to promote the coon and defends him when someone insults him such as when kyle called him faggy then accidentally letting his identity slip several times as the coon mysterion could tell he was cartman from the fact that he said kyle hated him although he already knew by the coons weight    although cartmans coon alter ego is designed after a raccoon the term coon is also a derogatory slur directed at africanamericans which makes sense given cartmans bigoted ways   cartmans way of disguising his voice and reporting his crimes to the police is similar to batman his plan to wipe out crime is also similar to rorscach from watchmen  the coons interactions with cthulhu are a reference to my neighbor totoro a studio ghibli film other interactions reference several classic warner bros shorts featuring marc antony a large bulldog who cares for the diminutive kitten pussyfoot the coon is shown to have visible fingers since he has claws
