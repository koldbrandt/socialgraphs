blind fury At this point she will begin readying a realtime attack a lethal tentacle slam that hits the four columns nearest to her  The objective of this phase is to get as many heroes as you can to the two leftmost columns of the battlefield before s attack meter fills up when it does the AllMother will interrupt the current turn to inflict a knockout blow on anyone in range The cultists will attempt to block New Kids path using the occasional knockback move to force them closer to their goddess  The battle shifts to Phase  once s meter is full   After smashing the battlefield with her mighty tentacle  will spit out two pulsating eggs from one of her mouths as well as any heroes that she devoured in her previous Dormant phase The eggs will land on random squares near the middle of the battlefield they have  HP and no attacks on their own but they also explode when damaged knocking back anyone directly adjacent to them After ovulating the Black Goat of the Woods will retreat into her pit with only several tentacles being visible  In this phase s only move is Devour a telegraphed attack that covers the two rightmost columns of the battlefield Any humans in the danger zone will be consumed on the bosss turn healing or harming her depending on their size and race  After catching someone with Devour  will reemerge as more cultists arrive to force the team towards her
