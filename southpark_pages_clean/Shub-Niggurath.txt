 shubniggurath is an elder god she made her first appearance in  and a cameo in the    shubniggurath is an outer god in the mythos and an incredible fertility deity with the ability to give life and take it with little effort  in  she is an elder god who resides in the basement of  being worshiped by the cops due to the fact she apparently craves dark meat the police falsely arrest black citizens across town and feed them to her   shubniggurath  as the final boss in the police station and is destroyed by the temporary alliance formed by coon and friends and freedom pals   like many elder gods shubniggurath is a morbid combination of tentacles and giant mouths  despite the complete greatness of her tentacles she is in possession of a gigantic one used to deliver powerful hits to the enemies the ones who are hit will have no chance of survival similarly among her mouths there is a giant one located in the upper body with knifelike teeth to chomp she also has a smaller exit below for ovulating and regurgitating devoured allies blinking yellow dots can be  scattered across her body likely serving as light receptors therefore her eyes   i i shubniggurath  black goat of the woods  blessed be us your faithful servants the destroyer of light  i i shubniggurath black goat with onethousand morbid young draw down the moon and extinguish the sun    shubniggurath is an evil goddess with powers beyond imagination any possible way of attack will result in complete devastation and any attack against will be proven futile the only way to defeat her is through feeding white meat to her  due to being a fertility goddess she is able to continuously ovulate and plant eggs onto the battlefield which will explode on those surrounding it upon taking damage  as revealed in the process of combat shubniggurath has two phases enraged and dormant   shubniggurath is fought at the end of the police station during  as an elder god or goddess she is tremendously powerful being completely immune to any of new kids attacks and armed with two instantkill moves however her dietary habits can be used against her when she uses her devour move to catch a victim she can be healed or harmed depending on the quality of the flesh white kid  damage white grownup cops  damage black kid tupperware and the amazing butthole if theyre black  heal any devoured heroes will be spat out of shubniggurath but theyll be unconscious and in need of an immediate revival also black kids wont be regurgitated unless at least one white victim was also devoured in the previous dormant phase  shubniggurath has two distinct phases that she will cycle through for the entire battle an enraged state and a dormant state both forms rely heavily on summoned minions to force the heroes into range of her powerful telegraphed attacks   after consuming white meat including at the start of the battle thanks to classi shubniggurath will burst out of her pit in a blind fury at this point she will begin readying a realtime attack a lethal tentacle slam that hits the four columns nearest to her  the objective of this phase is to get as many heroes as you can to the two leftmost columns of the battlefield before shubnigguraths attack meter fills up when it does the allmother will interrupt the current turn to inflict a knockout blow on anyone in range the cultists will attempt to block new kids path using the occasional knockback move to force them closer to their goddess  the battle shifts to phase  once shubnigguraths meter is full   after smashing the battlefield with her mighty tentacle shubniggurath will spit out two pulsating eggs from one of her mouths as well as any heroes that she devoured in her previous dormant phase the eggs will land on random squares near the middle of the battlefield they have  hp and no attacks on their own but they also explode when damaged knocking back anyone directly adjacent to them after ovulating the black goat of the woods will retreat into her pit with only several tentacles being visible  in this phase shubnigguraths only move is devour a telegraphed attack that covers the two rightmost columns of the battlefield any humans in the danger zone will be consumed on the bosss turn healing or harming her depending on their size and race  after catching someone with devour shubniggurath will reemerge as more cultists arrive to force the team towards her including sergeant yates the first time this happens from here the battle returns to phase  looping until either new kid or the boss are defeated

caringforyoureldergodpages explaining her eating habits caringforyoureldergodshubniggurath title card    shubniggurath is apparently not fully immortal due to the very fact that she was defeated by a bunch of kids and cannot actually kill mysterion although she can devour him though her defeat may have simply resulted in the destruction of her physical form rather than true death shubniggurath can take damage albeit much less damage only  from eating either a white new kid or your teammates excluding token if she eats the new kid if the character is black or token then she will regain  health shubniggurath in the mythos is described as an enormous cloudy mass entity an external form that the game fails to match well with however the games appearance matches the dark youngs quite perfectly with four main tentacles and a treelike form this implies that the shubniggurath under the station may be only an extension of the true elder god this may also explain why the skeleton key made to enter the basement is standard issue for every police station shubniggurath is the second lovecraftian deity to appear in   the first her grandson    ja zh
